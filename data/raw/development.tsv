development_pid_1	Waiting for my mind to have a breakdown once the “New Year” feeling isn’t there anymore : I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m a little bit worried that I’ll go back to being depressed in a few days time or something. Last year, I tried not to have any breakdowns for the start of 2019. A mere 10 days later, I broke down crying. I wasn’t the same for that entire year. Up until December, where I was ok that month. Now I just wait... it’s a weird way to act and feel, but it feels a bit normal.	moderate
