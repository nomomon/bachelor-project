valid_pid_994	I just don’t know what happened : I don’t have an idea how to preface this I don’t even know why I’m writing it but I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried seeking help, I’m taking pills but it hasn’t helped, I’m in therapy but it hasn’t helped, I’ve talked to friends and it has it helped. About half an hour ago a thought crossed my mind, I have an idea where my pills are, they’re easy to overdose on if you aren’t careful. Out of habit I thought “no that’s stupid” or something. but I stood up. I started walking but I was screaming internally to go back, to sit down, but I kept walking towards the medicine cabinet. If my mom hadn’t hidden and it wasn’t dark. I don’t know what to do.	moderate

valid_pid_2224	"How should I kill myself (question) : I’ve got three or four options
One the weak ass pellet gun I have done stairs I doubt it will do it but what’s your opinion?
Two unfortunately also weak ass ibuprofen and Tylenol (acetaminophen) which probably means kidney or liver failure which might be painful
Three the knife
The most painful option down the stream of course I’m trying to accomplish something
4 suffocating myself to sleep
The most peaceful option in the end although I suppose the knife would be peaceful in the end as well but I would be in a very large amount of stress but I’d end up having dmt shot into my brain and voila I’m drifting
5 any other option that could be in a random house hold that you guys know of preferable the most least painful 
Note: if you give a self help line I’m doing the secret option number 6 I do a nose dive off of my balcony not killing me but just breaking most of my bones"	moderate

valid_pid_1944	"I hate myself : I have struggled with my self image all my life. I've always looked at myself in the mirror thinking I was fat, ugly and unworthy. I spent my younger years letting people take advantage of me just to feel good about myself. This was at a time when I look back now that I realised I was beautiful and thin. Now 10 years later I have gained weight and can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. 
I've been in a relationship with the same person for 8 years. He tells me he loves me and that I'm beautiful but no matter the words he tells me I just don't believe him. I can't even motivate myself to fix the things I hate. Interacting with family, old friends, or even just trying to get the will to leave the house to seek help gives me crippling anxiety. This has become worse since I lost my job about a month and a half ago. 
I hide this from everyone around me fearing that they will tell me it's not true when I know it is. Or worse, making me seek help when I know it won't do anything. Some nights I lay there crying only feeling the intense pains in my chest. If I do sleep I have vivid dreams of loved ones telling me they are disgusted by me and hate me. 
I'm tired of living my life like this, I don't want to feel this way anymore but I can't motivate myself to seek help."	moderate
valid_pid_1916	"Just so lost : I can't even begin to explain this shit. I just feel like no matter how hard I try to be happy, I'm just living in a grey mood of fake happy from smoking fucking weed all the time. My lady told me she wants to die. She doesn't want to kill herself because she doesn't want to leave me and the kids without her, but she says she had no reason to live. I can't afford to pay for her to talk to someone professionally. She doesn't want to talk about anything specific about the depression, just says she's sad. Doesn't know why. And I fucking get it. I feel the same. Just cruising by, same day after same day. No happy. No sad. Just tired. Emotionally grey. I don't know what to say to her when she says she's sad. It feels like I annoy her if I try to comfort her with hugs or saying I'm here to talk. I don't know what to do, so I don't do anything. It's like, I wanna help, but my fucking mind won't even try to help. Just a droning ""uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh"" in my fucking head. I'm sure the weed doesn't help, but if I quit smoking weed I turn into a giant fucking asshole because every emotion comes out as anger. So what the fuck man? How the fuck do I even begin to deal with this? Somebody fucking help man."	moderate

valid_pid_1464	I’ve been trying my whole life to not be what my parents are and get out of the cycle and system I’ve been put through and I’m back again with my own family. : I hated growing up going to the court house all the time. I’d attribute all the constant fighting and back and forth to a majority of what I deal with today not being able to find joy in anything and constantly lying about happiness and pushing everyone away. I swore on my life to this day I would never put any children I have through this and yet I’m struggling to find my own time with him that doesn’t involve struggling and arguing with my bm everyday. I just wanted a family and I’m slowing losing my sanity and everyone around me. I don’t expect advice or anyone to really have much to say I’ve always tried to find a way out of this or see the good in it. It’s just getting so much lately. This weight on my chest is so heavy lately I feel like crying everyday and if I’m not crying I’m held up in my room. I’m 21 and everyone tells me that it’s only beginning and everything can get better but I don’t know if I can anymore.	moderate
valid_pid_464	"Depression made me the monster I was always afraid of becoming : And I didn’t even know it until it was too late.
Just in January I finally moved out of a toxic and abusive home. I finally started a job that I was proud of and happy with. I still had one of the most amazing, loving pets in my life. In February, the company let go of my whole department. In March, I finally had to put my childhood pest friend (Tiger) to rest. This week, I started a new job and I have stopped crying mornings and nights because the pay is awful and the workload is immense and no other jobs I’ve applied to have reached back out. Now, I’m going to lose my apartment because I can’t afford it. Today, my manager at my second job said she’s considering closing up for a few weeks and I literally rely on that paycheck to pay for my car. 
Less than 60 days, my life has turned upside down. I got so depressed and got so drunk from gin at a D&amp;D session that I threatened to harm or kill my self in front of my party and I don’t even remember. And you know what’s scary? I wished I would have done something about it later when I wasn’t in my right mind to think about it.
Today sitting in the shower I realized that I have become the one thing I was always afraid of: toxic. My mental health has deteriorated past the point of salvaging. I hadn’t noticed how nasty, rude, dissociative, and standoffish I’ve been to people until I realized that one text from my mother nearly sent me off the deep end of packing my bags tonight and leaving to go camp alone or just go to the beach and drown. What the fuck? Who fucking does that? 
I randomly deactivate my social media accounts just to see who would notice. I try listening to my therapist but things she says makes me so mad or make me realize things that are so out of control in my life that I just give up and sink down into nothing instead of trying to fix it (but also what’s the point?)
I’ve come home every day to lie in bed and watch videos until i sleep. I nearly broke down crying in the grocery store today from how overwhelmed I was and the intrusive thoughts in my head are growing worse and worse and worse.
I’m a failure. The world is literally ending. None of the mental health methods I’ve tried have been successful at helping me. I just get worse every year. I don’t contribute to society in any healthy way. Even my physical body is shit and iv been in and out of doctors office and hospitals for the amount of pain I’m in regularly with no answers.
I just want it to stop."	moderate
valid_pid_4160	Birthday blues : It’s always around my birthday I get mad depression. It’s always either the week before or even the whole month. Birthday is on the 20th and I feel like I have nothing. I have no one so what’s the point right? , I hate feeling so hopeless specially when people usually are so happy and joyful about another year. Well I’m not. I could care less about the next year or the year after that. I got prescribed some medication, and I just don’t know how it’s gonna make me feel or how I’m going to react to it. I just want to feel normal and like I matter I guess. Nobody really cares and it makes it worse because part of me doesn’t. I hate being here. Just venting I hate feeling like this.	severe

I found out today that my little brother may have lymphoma and he is being tested for it. I’m an absolute mess right now. I just started Valdoxan last night and have not wanted to die more than now. Not sure if it’s a meds thing but holy shit. The world is absolutely fucking bleak. I would give my life and more just so my brother could live. He doesn’t deserve this and I can’t fucking handle it. I don’t want to see him in pain or hurt. He has so much potential and he’s so kind and just such a gentle presence in the world. I just can’t handle this but I would so gladly give him my place in life. 
I’m also sick with the flu and missing work and feeling like I’m out of my body all together and I started Valdoxan last night. My mind is just somewhere else all together but I’ve never felt shittier. I’ve always thought about suicide but now the world just feels colourless and like I’m the outlier. I don’t even think I’m living.

valid_pid_2988	Ready for the world to end : Even though reactions are being considerably blown out of proportion, the reactions to the Coronavirus are making me giddy.

I’m anxious because I feel like I have nothing to work on, for the 3 weeks. Boss sent an email out Friday advising us of the above, but stressed that this is not a vacation. 
Well for me, it’s a forced vacation because I can’t do my job. I’m admin, but can’t do anything else adminy (like scanning) because I would need to physically be in the office and have access to server. Right now, all my admin tasks have been focused on fiscal year end (paying bills, making sure our orders come in on time, etc).

valid_pid_2028	"Starvation, humiliation and abuse... : Can anyone relate to being neglected as a child? For me, this one of the core bricks of my depression, and the ""ghosts"" that follow me every day... 
Me and my sister were raised in a chaotic household, without the money needed to take care of two children. My dad in particular could become extremely angry over anything. He was and still is an alcoholic, and spend tremendous amounts of money on cigarettes and booze instead of feeding us. I often found myself hiding behind curtains and other places, eating one-dollar baguettes or anything i could find. He and his parents ""my grandparents"" where quick to defend him at any cost.
Constant warfare between the two sides of my family made me chose sides, and who to align myself with in the next shitstorm of family drama. I was and still am extremely loyal, and will do anything someone tells me just to avoid trouble. 
As i said my mom and my dad didn't get along and often fought over who should have have us the most, and this often resulted in things becoming very heated, my dad would often chase me  on the way home to my mom, just because he was bitter over the fact that i went to my mom more than him. I know he did track where i walked because we often conveniently ""meet"" me in ally ways, and different places of the town where he never drove or would have any reason to drive to, hi used this ""convenience to drive me back to his place without my say"". 
one time he and my grandparents almost rammed my sister and my mom off the road, in an argument over a party she had been to or something, when they lost them they went back home where i was gaming minecraft and started to whale on me instead, saying that i was on their side and we where disgusting people and so forth..... honestly i don't remember much as it was this episode that left me with possible PTSD, as one doctor has said to me, but its not confirmed so.... I often prayed to god to kill me at the age of eight, as i was mentally exhausted. 
The police became involved several times, but nothing came of it as my dad is a master manipulator and always manages to get out of those situations, like this one time where he flirted with one of the inspectors of child protective services.   
Bulling is also something that has stuck with me, the humiliation of public bulling in school is the one of the worst things i have ever experienced. I can take a beating, and having been kicked by my class mates to unconsciousness, i can say that humiliation is worse. Standing in-front of the class and having people laugh at you, leaves a sense of shame that you cant get rid off. 
I moved from home about half year ago and started my higher education, but all of my experiences has left me a anxious wreck, if for example someone touches me without me knowing, something like a pat on the back or a loud noise. Will trigger many kinds of reactions a out fear, and if i become stressed out i often get a panic attack. 
this just starches the surface of what i have experienced, with abusive relationships and more, hopefully you guys can relate, i haven't really had many friends at all so haven't been able to compare my childhood wit anyone else, wonder if i am over reacting or not. I just needed to write some off this out, since i have been holding it in for so long and that strategy has not helped me so far.

train_pid_3417	"I'm so lonely and nobody's favorite : Last night (New Year's Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night's of my life. New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!"" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, ""Just make new friends!"" but that's not how it works. I can't just make new friends because its not that easy.

All they do is, while telling you something, trying to push you to tell something back so they know something about your family.
 And I just don't understand anymore, all I can see is people laughing with someone and turning around to roll their eyes. So why shouldn't they do that to you too?

over the past few months a lot has changed for me, some good, a lot bad. work is not going so great which is hard for me as it used to be such an important part of my life, now i just feel isolated and filled with dread whenever i am there, like an uneasy feeling i cannot really explain or shake.
i have a feeling like my life is going nowhere and i am not progressing as a human being, like i am not the man i sould be, the fact i am still fairly young (23) doesnt come to mind, i feel like i am running out of time and i havnt got much to show for myself
a few months back i met girl, through a friend during a weekend of mountain biking ( one of the few things i can do right now that helps me forget for a few hours at least) we sort of hit it off and became good friends rather quickly, something rare for me being autistic and having a lot of social problems. obviously i started to catch feelings for her, and after seeking a shite load of advice from close friends and a few failed attempts i finally scrapped together thr courage to tell her how i felt, i got a very thoughful knock back (something i was expecting deep down) and we both said that remaining friends will be completely okay, part of the reason i struggled to share my feelings was the fear of losing a good friend. however i know feel like i am slowly being pushed away. i am really struggling to cope with this lately as i feel like i have yet again ruined something that was going well in my life and i have been really beating myself up about the whole thing, getting the almost relentless feeling of being completely alone  that i am right for nobody.
i also have a very self destructive tendency to convince myself that nobody really cares about me, despite having some very close friends, some that i have actually grown closer to over recent months. friends that can make me feel that they love and care about me when i am with them can turn into people that wouldnt really care about me if i was to dissapear when left alone with my mind.
the only thing i have found that helps with these feelings is tasking myself to do things to keep my mind ocupied, tasks that i have to think about fully when doing them that i cannot think about anything else. i have chopped a hell of a lot of firewood in the past few days. but i cant do that sort of thing 24/7, which is when all those feeling flood back in. relentlessly. without fail.

valid_pid_2167	I feel like there's truly no way out : I've been depressed and lonely for years, and I just can't seem to climb upwards. I gained 1 friend a year ago, but for about 6-7 months now he's really not been giving a shit about me. My life is really stressful and I have really bad sleeping problems. I'm unmotivated, I don't feel good even if I accomplish something I just feel the very same empty feeling. Other's just make fun of me. I've been just spending all my time playing video games, but even games got boring alone. And when playing with others, I still feel very lonely. I'm not sure of anything at this point. I used to just write poems and help others. I don't write poems anymore, but I still help others even though I'm not so good of a person anymore. I always blame myself for everything since there's no one else to be blamed. Afterall, I'm alone. I don't know. I just don't feel like I can ever feel genuinely happy. I've really only been getting worse. I miss the person who I once was, and even though I know I should work on my current self, I just don't know. I don't have a goal that can be done. I just feel like nothing.	moderate

I absolutely hate this feeling, what’s resulted it because of me and the destruction I’ve caused. I’m so lost in life I don’t have any close friends anymore, the people who I once saw as my dear close friends basically abandoned me in my time of need so now I’m stuck with myself. It’s so hard not being able to talk with someone because my therapist sucks and she isn’t helpful at all. It’s just so hard, I can’t stand it but I’m trying for my family, I can’t imagine how heart-broken they’d be if I left this world for my selfish needs. I have so much trouble communicating because I truly feel no one understands me, I have an eager need to adventure and hang out but there is no one for me. I’m so miserable everything hurts I can’t keep up with school anymore, I’ve fallen from a bright A student to a failure of a kid. It’s only my sophomore year yet I’m falling into a deep hole. It’s tough trying to verbalize emotions and thoughts for me, I’m getting so sick and tired of it all. My dream is to go to the beach one day, alone and relax with nothing to hold me back. I’d like to die on that beach too, this world is harsh and I don’t know how long I’ll survive, but I’ll keep trying for my family and for you people on this subreddit.

I like a lot of stuff that I’m sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. 
I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it’s not family related.

valid_pid_299	"Morning negotiation : I know I'm not alone, I was just wondering how common my experience is.
I set an alarm and then ignore it/snooze it/reset it until I'm going to be late for work. Part of this is wrapped up in not caring about my job and marginal work ethic, I think. But as long as I can remember this has been an issue. I'll tell myself I'll get ready faster or I won't shower or I'll shower after work and on and on, but I know the excuses aren't real. I am delaying. I will be late for work. Usually I am able to make myself get out of bed right about when I'm supposed to be AT work and then everything is a mad rush. I got into a car accident because of this once.
The worst version of this felt like some kind of self-preservation, I was at an awful job and one of the big red flags was when I had a panic attack and could not force myself to get out of bed to go to work. 
This is certainly responsible for absenteeism and me being late a lot. I think feeling like the job doesn't matter is part of it. Probably feeling like I don't matter is part of it, too. I'm in Seattle so this week it's probably some low-key self preservation as well, but that's unrelated to this having been a challenge my whole life.
More alarms, louder alarms, etc, do not help. Getting everything ready the night before is smart, but also allows me to press my luck even more.
I don't imagine there are a number of tips and tricks for dealing with this, mostly I was just looking to see how common this is."	moderate

It gets especially bad if I forget to take my antidepressants regularly (I hate the pills so much), which of course I didn't this past week. That one's on me.
But a few hours ago, my boyfriend tried to call me and talk me down from freaking out. We talked about nothing in particular for a bit til it came to a conversation about what he did yesterday night.
He's been hanging out with two female coworkers a lot recently. They go out to eat and shop (which he usually hates), which is a little weird to me, but I was fine. But a few hours ago, he was telling me some things that didn't add up. He said he found out he was allergic to alcohol, but he's underage. I asked him about it and he said he tried a couple shots.
Where did you get alcohol from?
He said he stopped by to say hi to his manager on his way home and she offered him alcohol. 
Wait, but weren't you driving your two female coworkers home that night too?
Yes, they were there and they drank and got wasted haha.
But you drank, and you were the driver. And you told me you got home at 1. Did you drive drunk?
A pause.
I may have lied.
He told me that he actually went to his manager's house party. With his co-workers that he spends a lot of time with. He drank and hung out there until 3 in the morning. He says he drove the two girls home, went to his own house, and drove back to take one of them to work in the morning.
I might be too sensitive, but I had a horrible day overall and this stressed me out more. Why are you taking out two girls to do the things you do with me and more? If that was really all that happened, why lie about it to begin with? You're so eager to tell me about all the other dumb shit you do. It's 4:30am and I can't sleep.

Everything felt good about that, and yet all I can think about is how empty everything feels. Life feels so vacant anymore at this point. My job has no real purpose because I just fix technology, and technology doesn’t exist when the power is off, so in that case I’d just be some guy with nothing to do. I want to feel useful, or like I exist for a reason, but instead I feel trapped due to safety. My job is safe, and my anxiety prevents me from reaching out of the comfort zone.

valid_pid_3128	Birthdays suck : 22F here, been suffering with depression for almost two years now. I've noticed that over the past few years, when my birthday comes around, I feel quite down and not at all like a celebration. If it were up to me, I probably wouldn't celebrate at all, but my parents are very big on the family topic and they always want to gather for such things. I don't want to be forced to sit at a table with some family, making awkward small talk and having them take pictures of me holding the stupid cake. How do I tell my family that I'd rather be alone on my birthday, because it's making me sad rather than the other way around?	not depression

i thought i was close with those people, when in reality i wasn’t. i thought my actions would repeatedly be excused, but they weren’t. i don’t know how or why i’ve become this way and i would do anything to undo it... but, i am a borderline so things like this are destined to happen.
i miss the fun and laughs and memories so much. i’m  trying to get them to talk to me with stupid strategies that i know arent going to work because i’m too scared to apologize and tell them that i’ll be a better person because i feel like they won’t care, and it won’t matter.
what’s done is done and they will forever remember as a toxic and mean person who couldn’t control their anger or behavior, but while i was shouting insults, saying slurs, and overall just being a hateful person, in my head i was thinking “what’s wrong with me? why am i acting like this and why can’t i stop it? why i cant control myself?”
and obviously that’s not a good excuse for what i’ve done, but they weren’t the only ones hating me in those moments. i’m going to be alone forever, and i shouldn’t get my hopes up when i make friends like this again because it’s always going to have the same outcome. the pain and loneliness and rejection is all too familiar, but strikes with the same power it did just a few months ago when my best friend blocked me on everything and told me i would never be in his life again. maybe it’s happening again because i deserve to pay for all my anger and toxicity, for projecting my own insecurities onto other people.
anyways, that’s all. the moral of the story is that i’m never going to have a stable group of friends because of my own shitty behavior that i can’t control, and sooner or later people will start to get tired of it and cut me off or ignore me. i just want to know how to better myself. i hate the person i’ve become. why has this happened to me?
i’ve always struggled with behavioral issues and mental illness my entire life, and it seems that those things still and forever will haunt me to this day. not a day passed where i think about killing myself for the greater good of the world. i don’t deserve to be here, no one likes me anyways."	moderate

valid_pid_1577	"I feel like I shouldn't be depressed? :       For about the last 4 or so years, I have slipped in and out of depression. It kind of started midway through high school, about the time I was starting to think about college. I have two older siblings, one, my brother, 4 years older, the other, my sister, 3 years older. Around the end of my sophomore year, my brother sat down with me in my room and we hung out, and he told me about how he kind of got depressed in High School, and that he didnt want the same to happen to me. It hit me really hard, and I tried, but i couldn't stop it. Winter of junior year was probably the hardest, as it was the most I ever thought about suicide -- went to a bridge over a frozen river and sat on the edge for a while thinking about whether anyone would give a shit.
      Around the same time, my sister was being very hard on me, and to me it just felt like she didnt believe in my ability to make it to college, and that she though she was so much better. This ended up persisting for a long time, getting worse, to the point where I didnt really talk to her if I didnt have to. It peaked on a vacation, when I was upset. I slammed a car door, and my dad yelled at me, so I yelled back. Then my sister said ""what the hell is your problem"" and I shouted back, ""your the LAST fucking person I want to talk to."" Some weeks later she texted me, and we talked it over, she made up, but didnt seem to make any progress. Now we are still in a similar situation, where i find it very hard to forgive her. At this point I dont know if I'm depressed from family shit or high school shit, but I always feel like I have no one to talk to about it.
     I have a loop I go through with myself where I get depressed, dont want to talk about it, think about acting out/hinting at it to people to get them to pry it from me. Then I think ""no, you're just begging for attention"" and dont do anything, and suppress it. I know it isnt healthy, but I cant kick myself out of that pattern. My girlfriend of 3 years tries to help me by being there, but I shut her out, because I dont know how to explain how i feel. I dont know if I'm asking for help, or just writing this to try to get it out, but there. Thanks.

I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.
Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 
Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again.

I needed suggestions whether or not I should confess to my family and friends? The reasons i didn't do it till now are :
1)Mental health awareness is very poor in my country. My family would likely think I am faking it or everybody feels low sometimes
2)Afraid of being judged by the very few friends I have left. I am also afraid they might leave me eventually

Hi everyone,
My depression has been getting worse for the past year or so to the point now I feel like suicide is the only possible way for me. When I try to think about the future, my mind just goes blank. The feeling of waiting for the inevitable with so little motivation and so much negativity has completely taken over my life.
My psychiatrist told me to go jogging because exercise is the best way to beat depression. Due to the corona virus, he told me to play games, watch videos, listen to music instead. When I said that I wasn't motivated, he had a look of disappointment on his face and told me I couldn't do nothing and expect improvements. The meds haven't been working very well either so I'm going downhill fast.
I'm still going through a breakup so right now my psychiatrist is the only person I trust (Like 60%). I wouldn't be able to go out even if corona virus wasn't a thing.
I don't know what to do. Even if I were able to survive this, I still wouldn't want to live the rest of my life. I hate this world, the lies, the hypocrisy, selfishness, rudeness. I feel like I'm holding onto something that doesn't even exist.

train_pid_5838	"Could someone help me understand this? : I feel so numb. I'm 20 years old now and from what I can remember, about half way through secondary school (14/15 years old) I started to change. I started not wanting to be around my friends anymore and gradually reduced my friendship group until it was just me and someone else. I started not wanting to go to family events and I just wanted to stay in my room on my own. This horrible empty feeling gradually increase and surrounded me wherever I went.
I started to forget simple things that before I could easily remember and do no problem. This ruined my confidence entirely and my motivation and drive for things I enjoyed doing just didn't exist all of a sudden. It's as if everything I previously enjoyed doing or had any interest in wasn't worth the time and effort.
After the last years of secondary school I went to college and studied to become an electrician. At that stage my mind was blank so I just picked the course because I knew I had to do something. I met a guy in my class called Callum and I was brave enough to tell him what had been going on in my head throughout the last few years. To my surprise, he related to some of the things I need saying and eventually told me that he was trying to figure out a way to tell his parents that he's 'not feeling well'. I looked in to it and found out that a lot of the things him and I had talked about had a chance of relating to depression and anxiety, at which point I thought I'd try and gather my balls and tell my parents.
After crying, stumbling over my words and snotting everywhere, I managed to tell my parents that I'm suffering, to which, in a nut shell, they responded with ""ah you'll be alright, you're still growing so your emotions will be all over the place for a bit"". Considering I explained in pretty good detail that every night I'd pray that I'd die in my sleep, I was pretty confused that they didn't understand me that well.
So after this shitty story of how I started to realise that I may have a dark brain, I ask this. Any of your guys and girls out there that do suffer, would you be open to share some of your stories so that maybe we could understand a little bit more of how things build up?

valid_pid_1551	"I have a bad crush, and it triggered a heavy downward spiral. : I spiraled down hard today, and seeing as I don't really have anyone to talk to, I'm going to post this here and hope it helps. Here goes.
It's about a girl, mostly. Well, to back up just a bit, it's important to note that I have severe, persistent, medication resistant depression. I've tried a handful of meds, and not only did they not even begin to help, but they all had side-effects ranging from uncomfortable to severe. I started taking CBD oil, and that has actually helped a ton. I'm not saying there isn't a med that will work for me, but I haven't found it yet. I've suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life. I'm currently on disability because of my conditions. So there's just a little background for ya.
3 months ago, I started a program to become certified in a job in the healthcare field. It's taken me a long time to get to this point. I quit my job, broke up with my girlfriend, and moved back in with my parents about 5 and a half years ago. I decided I needed real help and that I needed to go back to school. I've been going to school very slowly and gradually built up to being able to handle a real work load. 
This past fall I was accepted into a program. The program completion is about 2 years away. On the first day of the program, I met this girl. She was stunning. I'm not going to give a ton of identifying detail in this post, but needless to say that I was immediately attracted to her. Of course, I thought about asking her out, but, being the depressed person that I am, I immediately thought that she's out of my league. I also thought about the fact that if it doesn't go well, we will be stuck in the same classes, day in and day out, for the next 2 years. I guess I was afraid that it would be unprofessional or awkward.
Two weeks go by before we see each other again and classes actually start. On the first day of class, she sat next to me and almost immediately teases me. Now I'm like, ""great. She's beautiful and witty. This sucks."" Over the next few days I come to find out that she is *very* intelligent, as well. She's kind; she's fit; she's an athlete; she has a smile that makes me weak. It's honestly hard to look directly at her. This is a bit of a ramble. The point is that I developed a huge crush on her. And it hasn't gone away. I thought perhaps that it'd be an infatuation that would fade over time, but instead I find myself thinking about her constantly.
I'm typically an indecisive, hesitant person, in general. The idea of asking this girl out, though, was just too enormous. *What if she rejects me? What if we go out on one or two dates and then she rejects me? What if we actually date for a decent amount of time but then we break up and we're stuck in this program together? I don't want things to be awkward. I don't want the rumors and the drama and the appearance of unprofessional behavior. I don't want the distraction from this very difficult program. When would I even find the time to attempt such a relationship?* There were just too many variables.
After a while, though, those questions and concerns seemed to matter less and less. They were still there, but I started to come around to the idea that I needed to do something. I couldn't just have this crush and be in agony. I needed to act. I decided I would invite her out to hang out as friends, and if things went well, I would ask her out. Not a bad idea, right? I would look for signals and see if we have a real connection outside of school.
I saw her today at school. She came in and sat by me and another classmate, for no reason. She really just came in to hang out with us.  She's done this several times, and this is part of the reason that I think there might be something there. *But is she coming in to see me or my classmate? Or am I overthinking this? I'm probably overthinking this.* 
We were working together for a few hours, but she says she has to stop real quick and let her friend in to the building. She mentions it's a ""him."" I immediately thought, *oh no. She's going to bring in some tall, broad, stud of a smoke-show, and she's going to show me what her type really is.*
I'm a skinny guy. I'm fit. I play sports. I have some decent muscle tone on my chest and abdomen, but I'm skinny. I don't have big arms. I'm about 5'11"" (she's actually about the same height as me. She's quite tall), but I'm not super tall. I weigh about 152. I'm a skinny guy. It's something that has always bothered me about myself.
So anyway, in walks this tall, broad, stud of a smoke-show. Fuck. My mind immediately went to a dark place. 
This guy *is her type. I don't know why I ever thought* I *would be her type. She's tall and beautiful. She doesn't want to be with some scrawny guy that isn't even taller than her. Look at this fuckin guy. He's a fuckin linebacker. Of course he is. Oh awesome. Hey what's up buddy? You're also being super charming and funny? Cool. Cool cool cool cool coooool. Fuuuck. What was I even thinking?* 
I finished up what I was doing and got the hell out of there. I didn't say bye. I just snuck out. I then proceeded to kick my own ass all the way home. I've never been so disgusted with myself. I won't go into my exact thinking, but it was some dark stuff, and it was a long drive home.
When I got home, I immediately crawled into bed. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't get on the internet; I couldn't watch a movie; I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat; I couldn't read a book; I was in depression purgatory. I basically stayed in bed from the time I got home until I eventually forced myself to eat, and now I'm here.
I'm just so very down. I don't really have anyone to talk to. I have very few friends, and I don't think I can talk to any of them about this. I'm alone."	moderate

I cannot be in silence. So I am listening to 90’s country instead of the usual current day rock.  
And for about thirty minutes. I was happier than i have been in a year. For thirty glorious, heavenly minutes. I had no anxiety. No depression. No stress. Just belted out some country and laughed as my puppers side eyed my singing. True peace.  
Once the dishes were done. The kitchen cleaned up from dinner two nights ago. And the dishwasher running. Once I returned to the couch. The happiness left. As always it does.  
But for those thirty glorious minutes. I was free.  
Webster’s dictionary describes silence as the forbearance from speech or noise. The absence of sound.  
I strongly disagree. In silence there is so much noise. Such a cacophony of noise.  
“You are trash”.  
 “No one loves you”.  
  “You are a waste of air”.  
The voices go on. I could write until time ends and darkness descends and never have all written down.  
And the worst of it all. It is not the voice of any detractor.  It the voice of a childhood enemy. Not the voice of a best friend long since past.  
No. It is my own voice I hear. When the music stops. The tv turns off. I only ever hear my voice. My daemons. My silence.

valid_pid_3139	6 YEAR PROGRESS : When I was 12, I was exposed to psychological bullying at school. I walked away from all my friends.  After a while I got depressed. I pulled myself out of people. During this period, I became friends with my depression. For some reason I did not want to get rid of it. I felt good with it ridiculously. At 14, I tried to harm myself. Then I realized how ridiculous it was.  During this time, my social anxiety started. My family was worried about me. I went to many psychologists, but I did not see any benefit. My mom refused me to use medication. I didn't want it either. Because everything was ending in my head. I struggled for years. I haven't been out for months. When I got on the subway, my heart was pounding and i was having trouble breathing. I don't remember how many times I got off from the subway and got into another one because it was crowded. I forgot how to talk to people.  My hands were shaking every time. After a while I got bored with this situation. People thought I was doing it to get attention. This made me feel like shit. I made some friends. They approached me first. Then I approached them without noticing. I went out with them. I started talking to people but still my hands were shaking. I showed my real personality to people.  I don't care what they think. If I got angry, I was making it clear. I just didn't show when I was upset. I am 18 years old now. I got rid of my depression. My social anxiety is over. I can now go public. I can talk to people. But I'm still not going out alone. I believe that this will also pass over time. All will pass over time, friends. We will all have a happy life eventually.	not depression
valid_pid_3629	Should I avoid dating with my current position in life? : I’m 21, taking a year off from school. I work part time at a Walmart, but I don’t have a car and I’m going paycheck to paycheck. I live with my best friend at his mom’s house. I pay rent, but my bedroom acts as our living room so not a whole lot of privacy. I have pretty poor social skills and have zero luck with women anyways. I also have clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and dissociation, all of which I’ve dealt with since I was a small child. I was in therapy all throughout my childhood and have gotten significantly better at coping with it, though atm I’m too broke to afford health insurance, so now therapy or meds because I definitely can’t afford out of pocket even with a sliding scale. I am always trying to improve myself, though, I’m not the type to let mental illness be an excuse to let my symptoms run rampant, and I don’t let it affect my personal relationships as much as I can.

Sometimes I lose them, sometimes life gets carried away and I forget..this time I’ve been so stressed about this corona virus stuff and I’ve been constantly fighting with my partner. 
Speaking of my partner...I feel like such a pain in the ass every time anything relating to my mental health occurs. I’m emotional and destructive (mostly self destructive) and no one should have to go through that. I really love them and I wish they could be with someone normal.

valid_pid_4225	"New to Sub, but Not to Depression : I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression as a teenager. I've gone off and on treatment over the years. Currently on welbutrin, buspar, and klonipin with counseling. 
I've been with my husband over 11 years. Last year he was diagnosed in his 30s with severe ADHD. Last week he was also diagnosed with bipolar. We've been living separately for about 6 weeks. I haven't told anyone other than my counselor.
Obviously things were spiraling badly for us to get to this point. He never physically hurt me but was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive. It felt like only a matter of time.
I used to self harm and have passive suicidal ideation frequently, which my counselor is aware of.
My partner says he wants to get help and is set to start cognitive behavioral therapy and medication next weekish. 
This whole journey really started 2 years ago when I couldn't take his mothers shitty treatment of me anymore and our friend killed himself and I asked him to get counseling.
Now here we are 2 years later, all these changes and resources and everything still sucks so much. I can't even tell my family. They have their own issues and lives and are across the country.
Now another friend committed suicide over Christmas and all I can think about is what a miserable piece of shit I am with a miserable life and how nice it would be not to live it anymore.
I'm just really down over it all. I tried to be a friend to my partner but I think he just hates me. He lives in our detached garage and I don't know why he treats me the way he does.

I'm 33 now and haven't seen him since I was 16. We were best friends when I was a kid but kinda grew apart as I got older as I live in Arizona and he lived in Washington State.

valid_pid_122	"My perspective : Please listen to me and don’t ban before listening. All of this anguish, pain, self doubt, and hopelessness has cursed us, we have even been thrown into the darkest depths of emotional emptiness, nothing to fight for, nothing to live for, there seems like there is no salvation, we are abandoned. Trust me I’ve felt it. 
But isn’t it beautiful, isn’t it the most poetically glorious thing, when the soldier walks through the trenches of hell, through bombardments of demonic fire,  the strongest adversary he has ever faced in his life, losing friends and limbs. It seems like he will never be whole again, but forty years later, maybe fifty, he is sitting in his old wooden chair, his grandchildren playing in the yard, and finally, there it is, strangely... peace, freedom, everything he had fought through has led him here, but he had to fight like hell, he had to push through, he had stared death himself in the face and had the guts to stick it to him. 
Why let it all go now? Yes you may never be able to achieve your ultimate dreams, yes you may never meet your dream  partner, yes you may not even reach your goals or the expectations of others, no matter how hard you try, that’s reality, but that’s just how it is, but there IS a life out there, and it’s better than death, one that isn’t as painful and shit and unbearable as it is now, there 100 percent is, maybe as a school teacher, maybe even a construction worker with all your construction worker buddies, maybe you find something you are good at, Ju jitsu, painting, music, maybe you find a friend you love spending time with, maybe you finally meet a girl or boy with great effort, maybe step by step after years you overcome the social anxiety, maybe you build yourself in the gym and form a body you never thought you could have, maybe you could get a job that you are atleast content with, and you can use that money to help and improve others, it may not be a life of glamour, but it’s something. And when you set those goals, and you work towards them with everything you have, every single hour, second put in, with every blood sweat and tear poured in and you finally make it, with little goals like this, wouldn’t it feel infinitely better? 
And when you had walked through the roaring fires like those soldiers before you, and you’re standing on the peak, the peak you have for yourself, you will know that you have made it, you made something of your life, there isn’t only emptiness, at that point, I promise, it will have all been worth it. 
The weak die by giving up, suicide? No such thing, that is pathetic, we all fade away in the end, no matter where you are or where you who you will end up like those who have given up, but what differienciates you? You fought, you stayed when those weaker than you couldn’t, be rich or die trying, be happy or die trying, you have the right to be happy, and if this life derives you of it, the FIGHT, you may not make it, but atleast you didn’t go out like a coward and who knows, maybe you will make it, if not now, than in 20 or 30 or 60 years but it will and can happen!"	moderate

I’m in my senior year at High School, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to graduate due to my many days of absence, and not having been able to work much with school, because I’ve been struggling a lot with depression. Since christmas I’ve been at school maybe a couple of weeks combined. 
I know I’m not stupid, but I feel like such a huge waste of potential. Not that I’m a genius or anything, but I should at least be able to graduate with decent grades. My entire country have switched to online schools for a few weeks now, and I thought not having to go to school, and being able to work from home would be easier. But it’s not. When I log onto the learning platform I’m completely overwhelmed and just end up sitting there in my room, feeling horrible. 
All of my friends know what they’re gonna do next year, and I don’t even know if I’m gonna graduate this year. I can’t imagine things turning out alright for me, and I can’t imagine a proper future for myself either. I don’t know what to do. I feel like my depression is eating away at such a huge part of my life.

train_pid_5894	"Am I Depressed? : I know other posts already exist with this query, yet, even still I doubt myself.
To put context, I am 17, and I’ve found myself increasingly less motivated in most of what I do, and almost completely incapable to pick myself up to take a pencil to paper for the homework of my classes. It’s building up even now while I despair, yet no matter what I’m drawn to simply sitting around, to waiting. I don’t know when specifically this began. Last year? The year before? I could technically even say the signs of noticeable lack of motivation, harsh self-critique and occasional days of inexplicable fatigue began somewhere around the end of middle school, and I’d almost say it was the cause of my first C grade- which for me was an absolute failure and evidence that I’m just lazy as it came from a lack of doing homework- in English, yet trying to say that makes me feel like it’s an unforgivable attempt of brushing the failure off with an excuse.
Although I have once admitted a desire for self-harm and only glanced upon the chances of depression with her, we had assumed it to be from the use of Acutane, which is of course known to cause a variety of psychological issues. However, now it’s been over half a year since I quit the heavy acne medicine, and I’m still carrying these potential symptoms. If anything, to a severely worse scale.
I do, though, still have my positive days. In fact, I have quite a few. To add further, I have an intense interest in writing that hasn’t been dulled by any of this. In fact, it’s only grown. If there is any class that I haven’t been falling behind in yet, it would be my current American Literature class, simply for my love of reading and writing. I guess if anything, I’ve been using this as an excuse of “see? You’re happy. You’re fine. You’re just making an excuse for procrastinating.”
...Thing is, by now I’d have usually brought myself back up. I’ve always noticed a trend with myself in dipping in performance in school, only to recover and pass with As and Bs, long before I even hit an F. Right now, though, I’ve failed two classes lately and am probably due to fail another two if this continues...
I really only ask this to confirm whether or not I should discuss with my parents on seeking treatment. It just feels like such a drastic and wasteful thing to commit if it turns out I’m somehow using this as an excuse."	moderate

I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school.

I am sitting here in my cold room looking at all the stuff I like to keep me busy, guitar, videogames, social media/anything on my phone, my friends, my family, books. I enjoy all of this stuff but when I look back at the happiest moments in my life I either don't get the chance to do what I love anymore, or i just don't love the few things that did used to make me happy. Now I just sit in my room thinking about what I can do different, but at the same time, I don't think doing things different will change how I feel. Where did my imagination as a kid go? My favorite thing was pretending I was a super hero. I used to spend hours playing games as a kid never getting bored. I used to love running, now I can't even convince myself to go for a walk, I used to work out too and I fucking loved that. Hikes too now I need someone to invite me to even think about doing that.

It's the New Year, and like a lot of people around here I'm really struggling. If everything goes well, I'll have 3 years sober. I guess without the alcohol and the drugs I'm just left with myself, and that is the problem.

Without the drugs and alcohol I just cannot seem to make the slightest effort to make meaningful relationships with people. I still go to meetings but even in a room full of people I can feel so alone. I don't have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now I guess I've isolated myself so much that I just don't know how to talk to people. I drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. I don't know how I'll go through this year. I just hope I can make it to the three years in March.

Not my first, but maybe the worst since my first in 1989 when I made my first (pathetically failed) suicide attempt. For most of the next 4 years I hid it - apparently successfully - until a dissociation crisis in Dec 2018 scared me enough to take another chance on the local mental health system despite the significant risk their antiquated attitudes to mental illness would cost me my job and maybe my family.

A few months later, I finally told my wife, who is local, and was treated to a lecture about how I'm weak, how everyone has problems, how I was stupid to let the doctors ""trick"" me into taking pills when all I needed was good friends and a hobby. I brushed it off, and worked it anyway. This time last year I was in full remission and came off the meds. And I was doimg great, feeling more like *me* than I had in decades. 

But the weeks became months, and the months added up, and by the time summer came I was painfully aware of how disconnected we were. Some of that is definitely due to my depression - the sour moods, the pulling away - but more was because she had just refocused in ways that excluded me from her life. And when I look back, I realised that half my problem had been that when things were worst I no longer felt safe reaching out to her. In August I started slipping again, in October I needed to gp back on meds, by the end of November my doctprs gave me anti-psychotics - just in case the urge to self-harm or suicide got too much to manage.

An now it's a New Year. I had a long break over Christmas so I wanted to visit family and friends back home. She and the kids didn't come. And it's been so good. The enthusiasm and love from friends and family is incredible. I haven't felt so loved and wanted in so long. That's a problem. 

Today I realised that depression has killed my marriage. I don't know how we can get back from here, but I know the sense of isolation and the lack of partnership is a big part of why I relapsed. Getting bavk might literally be impossible. And now I'm stuck with an impossible decision on top of already having days when I really, really wish it would all just end."	severe

valid_pid_3500	"Something beautiful I found in YouTube comments(I know, right) and just wanted to share it with you guys : Here it goes:
The most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways - except towards themselves.
Always remember this. When you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, don't take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early.
Just pull them aside and let them know it's alright and that we are all lost here. That's all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that doesn't matter, and truly connect with them - even if just for a second - to have a human moment.
Even subtle eye contact can do it. Just don't let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. Cuz they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world.
Depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds - for to them, they are alone. Cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can't connect even for a second. And all they want is to be loved. To legitimately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. They need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves.
They have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. They realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership - and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. To them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. But without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet still feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a TV show and a bowl of ice cream.

The only person who knows is my mom and doctor but I have to talk to my friends and girlfriend about it but I just cant bring myself to tell them so when it happens i get all angry because that is how I cope with it but also it hurts me so bad and all I want to do is just lie on the ground and just cry but I have to keep going and keep pushing through because I have to many responsibilities to just stop doing everything. And i constantly want to die but I keep thinking about my mom and girlfriend and friends.

valid_pid_2150	"I'm falling back into depression and I don't know what to do : So I'm in my early 20s, I'm cis female and I'm lesbian. I have severe anxiety but I'm a musician so I interact with a lot of different people. I always try to be nice to people and move on with my life. I'm a private person so I don't ask too much about others and expect the same in return. So basically this dude DMs me and says he likes my music, I thank him for the support and send him an unreleased track (which isn't abnormal for me, I send my music to anyone who will listen). So one day I do a QnA and he asks me, ""How does p!ssy taste?"" This shakes me up kinda because even though I don't hide my sexuality, I keep it to myself and don't go into detail. I tell him to never ask me something like that again and says he understands, I brush it off as a one time occurrence. I decide to start to dry text more than I usually do, avoid, and distance. One day he DMs me again, and is like, ""check my story."" I tell him that there's no way I'm doing that without knowing whats on the story. He tells me he plans on dropping his ex girlfriend's nudes but tells me whats on his story is just a fight, I shut him down immediately and tell him what he wants to do is illegal. I don't click the story and I move on. The last occurrence was after he sent me a meme. I sent him a 100 emoji hoping to end the conversation naturally then out of no where he's like, ""This girl tried to send me titty pics but got mad when I said I didn't care"" Again, I shut him down and was like, ""I don't want to talk about this and I'm not the person to speak to on this."" He says he understands and is like, ""I respect that, I'm just really young so I don't understand things like that."" that freaks me out, like this dude knew I don't discuss sexual things. I just tell him, ""everyone has boundaries"". He described me as ""family-friendly"" to my face. I don't know anything about this person, he did mention something about being three in 2010 when Nicki Minaj was famous but I have no way of verifying that.
So that brings me to recent events, I end up telling him to stop contacting me (I made a public post about leaving me alone that was partially at him and to set firm boundaries) . Out of morbid curiosity I go onto his twitter. I see an Omegle chat where he claims to be 18 but who really knows, I scroll down and I see that he's tweeted out pornhub videos (which is something I don't see very often). I go onto his likes and at first it's just some sports stuff. I decide to scroll down some more and it goes from ""porn out of context"" clips to hentai, some weird hentai too like girl being roughly screwed by humanoid pig creature porn. That's when it clicks why he didn't respect my boundaries, it puts everything else into context as well. So that brings me to where I am right now. I feel conflicted. I feel like this is my fault because I didn't research who this person fully was, granted I shut down certain topics if I felt like they were going in a direction I didn't like. I handled it the best I could. I blocked him shortly after. I feel stupid and weak because I didn't stand up for myself but I just assumed it was going to end up being a one time event and the first time was a simple misunderstanding. I minimized, I'll be real. I know I sound stupid but I feel like a slipped up and let a boundary of mine be disrespected, I had just been trying to not go off on people and be civil but it didn't work. It makes me feel sick but at the same time guilty. My anxiety is telling me I did something illegal unintentionally. I feel somewhat violated by this whole experience but I feel shame because I'm not sure how I should react. I feel weak because I should have stood up for myself."	moderate
train_pid_5639	Someone : I sometimes feel my mind is a dark and terrifying place. A place that I shouldn’t let anyone into.

Doubt about what it loves, who it loves, does it really love, what it is, what it’s not, what it wants, what it doesn’t, what is right, what is wrong, and so on. How do I let someone in? Why should I let someone in? And how would I even start explaining the me I keep hidden in my minds prison? I don’t want anyone to save me, I’m the only one who can do that. But It sure would be great if I met someone who understands, even when I don’t. Someone to tell me it’s okay to be scared, that it’s okay to not know.

It’s isolating sometimes, I think that is where the sadness comes from.  
Seeing friends is hard when there are nonsensical reasons that you can’t go out after work.  
Having hobbies can be hard when you can’t get out of the bathroom.  
Sleep is hard when the times you need to be in bed and out of bed don’t allow for it.  
Every time I get into a new hobby I am always worried, waiting for the moment I am going to have to leave it behind for some silly reason.  
I get scared about my intrusive thoughts, when they fixate on things like jumping off a building or walking in front of a car. I don’t want to do those things but I am forced to fixate on them, looping the thoughts over and over. It is desensitising.
Weirdly, the rest of my life is doing fine, my job is great and only getting better. Embracing my OCD helped me get where I needed to be. My partner is amazing and more than I could ever ask for. But I am petrified of the thoughts taking over and I lose myself to an off intrusion and end it all. I get angry at all my long term friends for being able to keep so close to one another while I sit in the shower again at home and dont talk to them for another two months.

We were great together, we'd go out and have our version of fun (not clubbing like the majority of uni students cause I honestly hate it) and I even met my now boyfriend when out with her. Last summer she texted me out of nowhere saying she's dropping out. My grandma has also just passed away and honestly, I just felt like shit and cried for a few days - I am NOT a crier.
The beginning of second year was terrible, I felt lonely and depressed and the only one to snap me out of it was my boyfriend. He encouraged me to become better friends with people from my course and I did. It was all nice until a couple of days ago I had a bit of an argument with one of the girls in the group and now everyone is just avoiding me.

They all sat together and did not invite me over. At the end of the day, they all just left and didn't say a word to me, even though I was right behind them.

Deep breaths. Calm my racing heart. Alright.
The feelings I have towards my parents are complicated. If they were shitty people in all aspects of their lives, I wouldn’t feel guilty about hating them. However, they carry traits I admire, and there are many positive things they have done, not just for me but also for others. That is why I have a difficult time accepting my negative feelings for them. At times, it feels inappropriate for me to hate them, but other times, I feel like that is the only way I am capable of feeling towards them.
For the majority of my life, but specifically the entirety of my childhood and youth, my dad was an alcoholic who would, on occasion, hit my mom while he was drunk. At that time, I was very young and I was still an only child. It didn’t matter to me that my dad was working while attending a competitive university. I didn’t care that he was struggling to balance his work life, academic life, and family life, all while dealing with the emotional strain that our financial situation caused. I didn’t care about how my dad was also struggling in his own way, but only hated him for how he treated my mom. My dad is also the type to move on from things quickly, whereas my mom holds grudges. So after hitting her, my dad would act like nothing happened the following day. This cycle was something that deeply angered not only my mom but also me.
My mom worked (she still works) full-time as a registered nurse. She makes more money than my dad. I often wondered why that didn’t give her the confidence to defend herself without crying, but then again, I will never know the pain of being coerced into an arranged marriage and having to move to another country to be with my husband, leaving my family behind in my native country. I think there was a lot of sadness in my mom’s heart during the early years of her marriage as well as raising me. She got married at 22. My dad was 29. They had me three years into their marriage (I was born in 1999).
When I think of my childhood, there’s something in particular that always comes to mind. It happened multiple times back when my mom worked night shifts. She would hide my dad’s alcohol and tell me not to tell him where it was. I agreed. However, once she left for work, my dad would approach me, all smiles. He asked me where his alcohol was. I told him I couldn’t say. Then, he said that he’d buy me whatever I wanted. Like an idiot, I agreed. Every time. My dad never remembered the promises he made to me once he was sober again. Almost 21 years later, I can’t help but shiver at how naive I was…
As a kid, I didn’t eat much. Two reasons: one, I wasn’t fussy. I never complained about being hungry, so other than getting fed when my mom was home, I didn’t really eat. You know how when you’re a kid, your parents usually force you to eat? It’s like that. Because I never complained about being hungry, my mom would feed me simply because “it was time to eat”, but when she wasn’t home, there was no one to feed me. The second reason I didn’t eat much is precisely that. My dad never checked on me when my mom left for work in the evening. I passed the time by watching TV, and sometimes I fell asleep early. But one time, I got bored and went upstairs to see what my dad was doing. He spent so much time on his computer, and he never even spared one look at me after I gave him his alcohol. So, that day, maybe I was looking for an answer. I stood outside my dad’s room and looked inside. He was drinking a beer, looking at something on the computer. That much wasn’t shocking. But I was completely confused by what I saw on the screen. Looking back, even if I had seen it clearly, I wouldn’t have known what it was. I was too young then. But the second my dad noticed me, he closed quickly the tab. He rushed me out of his office and locked the door after going back inside.
I didn’t realize it was porn until I was in my late teens. It still haunts me to this day. I remember I went back to my room after that and I thought I’d seen a Disney princess on the screen or something. I got excited thinking maybe my dad was looking up a doll or something to buy for me. Why was I like that…?
There was another episode that occurred when I was six years old. By then, I developed a habit of staying in my room even though I knew my parents were fighting. I heard multiple voices from my room. It sounded like my grandpa was coaxing my dad. My maternal grandparents lived with us at that time because my mom had gotten pregnant “unexpectedly”. My dad was very irritated and angry during her entire pregnancy. I don’t really know why, but that day, I stepped out of my room and peeked into my parents’ bedroom where all the adults were gathered. My grandpa was pulling my dad’s hand back. My mom had her hands around her throat, coughing drily. Without a word, I went back to my room. My mom came into my room a few minutes later and locked the door. She spent a long time crying. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that feeling. Pathetic, helpless… something like that. But I don’t know if those thoughts were directed at myself or my mom.
However, the dynamics of our relationships all changed by the time I was a teenager. During my adolescence, my relationship with my parents turned very sour, especially with my mom. Up until 8th grade, I did well in school. I had mainly As and Bs. However, in 8th grade, I got my first C. It was in science. But there’s something I need to explain before I go further. As I said, my mom’s a nurse. My dad’s a clinical laboratory scientist. Both of those careers have a lot to do with science, and my parents were also really studious growing up. One could argue that it’s because they’re Indian, but I think that’s just their personality/a result of their upbringing. They both work hard and never slacked off at school. My maternal grandma was a housewife. She got married at 19 and didn’t have much of an education, but she still pushed my mom to study well so she could have a good career in the future. My dad came from a broken home. His mom died of ovarian cancer when he was 15, and his dad was an alcoholic who spent his time gambling. My dad was very close to his mom and loathed his dad for neglecting his parental duties. (I always found this funny since my dad displayed a lot of behaviors similar to his dad when I was young, but whatever…) Since my dad has five siblings, there was even less money to go around. Still, somehow, my paternal grandfather managed to send all of his kids to America. Now, they all have good lives and good incomes. They were only able to come here and acquire a good job with the degrees they earned in India through hard work.
It’s because of this that my parents don’t take school lightly. In America, K-12 is free if you go to public school. In India, school is expensive at all ages. In Kerala, many kids start school at age three, and they begin learning three languages at the beginning of grade school. The education there is also much more difficult and at a higher level than what’s taught during K-12 in America. The reason why I want to emphasize this goes back to what I said previously. I got my first C in 8th grade, and I was an anxious wreck when I went to show my mom my grade report. (We had to have a parent sign it and then bring it back to school). Because my parents’ schooling was much more difficult and competitive than what I was dealing with, I knew beforehand that my parents wouldn’t be able easily to accept my first bad grade. I was right. I never got that grade up either. I ended up graduating from 8th grade with that C, and I had a feeling that things would only get worse from there. I was right.
In 9th grade, I failed two classes: biology and geometry. After that, my grades were mainly Cs and Ds. I only got As in useless classes like PE and extracurriculars. My parents constantly degraded me because I was a disappointment. Since I wasn’t doing good in school, they couldn’t brag about me to our relatives. Nothing that happened in our home stayed within our home either, so the concern that I might not graduate high school quickly spread among our relatives.
Because I did poorly in school, I felt inferior when I was around my family. Due to my upbringing, I’ve always had a fearful/avoidant approach to relationships, which means I constantly switch from wanting to be accepted by my parents and wanting them to treat me as if I don’t exist. Since I can’t raise my voice at them or tell them how I feel, I ended up having a lot of internal conflicts and couldn’t cope properly with the things my parents said to me. As a result, I just stopped talking to them. Although we lived in the same house, I acted as if they were ghosts that I couldn’t see. My parents can handle yelling but they can’t deal with being ignored, and because I couldn’t be honest and tell my parents how I felt during that time—that I felt like I didn’t fit into our family because my ideals were different from theirs, that I believed there were more important things than school and grades—all I could do was show my anger through silence. But silence can always be misinterpreted…
My lack of reaction to everything around me caused a lot of issues in my family. I even got caught by my parents while I was on shrooms when I was 16 (actually, I shouldn’t say “caught” since I told them I was on drugs during a bad trip/anxiety attack [totally my fault for taking an eighth at once, never happened again]). But this happened at a bad time. I didn’t have many birthday parties growing up, so my parents wanted to hold a sweet 16 birthday party for me. This was merely a performative party for my parents to pretend like our family wasn’t on the verge of breaking. I didn’t want a party for that exact reason, but it still happened. It was only a month later that I was caught on drugs, and it caused an even bigger rift between my parents and I. They lost all trust in me, but honestly, I lost my trust in them too. I can’t remember many of the things I told them when I was tripping out, but I know for a fact I told my parents I felt depressed, and I remember exactly what my mom said in response: “What do you have to be depressed about?” I wish I could’ve told her, “Right. You telling me that you wish I wasn’t born isn’t something that should affect me after all…”
After this incident, they took off the doorknob on the door for my room, I wasn’t allowed to be alone, and they wouldn’t let me sit alone with my sister because they thought I’d contaminate her or something. For this reason, I thought being at school was still better than suffocating at home in that tense, judgemental, depressing environment.
My father had bouts of explosive anger during my high school years. Of course, they were all caused by me. On my 18th birthday, I came home from school and felt very odd. My dad picked me up but I don’t remember what happened during the car ride. Once we entered the house, I think he went straight to bed. He worked night shifts and would sleep after picking my sister and me up from school (my mom had switched to day shifts a long time ago). I went upstairs to my room. As I looked around, my face felt very hot all of a sudden. Most of my things were gone. Aside from heavy furniture, my belongings were nowhere to be seen. All I saw was a white letter folded on my desk. It was my progress report for that quarter. All Ds. My dad’s handwriting was underneath. People tend to forget things that shock them too greatly, so I don’t remember exactly what that letter said, but it was something like, “You’re 18 now. We don’t have to take care of you. If you don’t graduate high school and go to college, we’ll kick you out.”
I got so angry that I cried. Only a few weeks before this, my parents and I had already talked about my future. I told them I wanted to be a tattoo artist and that I wouldn’t waste money by going to college. I mentioned that there were people I knew who could help me get started. They hadn’t objected to anything when I told them either. I went on stupidly, believing that they accepted my choices. I thought maybe we had finally reached some kind of understanding.
I realized once again that no one in my family cares about what I want. How I feel. My dreams for my future.
Unfortunately for me, at the end of the day, nothing mattered. I was financially dependent on my parents, and if I wanted to have a roof over my head, I had to live my life how they wanted me to. I started to think that maybe I was fated to always be controlled, and fated to always let myself be controlled.
That very evening, on my 18th birthday, I applied to a community college in my city. My grades were shitty and I didn’t even know if I would graduate, so that was my only option. My parents didn’t give any reaction when they found out I had applied, but on my graduation day, their personality changed completely.
Since my grades were shit, I didn’t know if I would graduate until two or three weeks before the ceremony (after grades were finalized). My senior class had close to 1,000 students, and I was ranked 950 or something like that (our school had around 4,000 students). It’s kind of sad but also funny to think that even the people who barely knew me would say things like, “Nah, you look really smart. You probably have all As,” to me whenever I said I wasn’t doing good in class (which was my usual response whenever someone asked me to help them with their work). This was another reason why I could never bring myself to ask teachers or classmates for help with my assignments. Everyone assumed I didn’t need it, so I felt like I didn’t have the right to ask.
Anyway, as I was saying, my parents completely switched up on me after I graduated. I started college in the summer after graduating. I chose criminal justice as my major but changed it to psychology a year later. For the most part, my parents acted like the past never happened. They were suddenly very bright, very joyful, had no enmity towards me, and even joked about my high school days by the time I was halfway through college (I’m currently in my 3rd year). I think that maybe that’s the only way they can cope with how they treated me. Maybe we’re all secretly thinking of the mistakes we made and hating ourselves for it, but I’ve never been the type that can put on an act, which is why it’s difficult for me to try and understand things from my parents’ point of view.
To explain further on the financial dependency part… I didn’t get my first cellphone until I was 19. Similarly, I didn’t get braces until I was 17. I considered both of these things luxuries, and I felt some bitterness towards my parents for not allowing me to have these things at a younger age. But I realized in college that there are more important things in life. The reason my parents didn’t want to spend a lot of money on things that weren’t needed was that they wanted to pay my college tuition in its entirety. If you didn’t know the salary of an RN and a CLS, I’ll let you know that it’s not small. But ultimately, that’s not my money, and I’ve never felt entitled to my parents’ money. I’ve never asked my parents for money (like allowance or lunch money) and usually alternated between the same 3-4 outfits while I was in high school because I didn’t want to ask them for things and feel indebted later on. I guess you can say I’m very much influenced by the American style of thinking that you shouldn’t leech off your parents after a certain age. But my parents’ mindset is not American at all in that regard. They told me that the reason they work and make money is so my sister and I can have easier lives. Because my dad had to go to university in America even after getting a degree in India (due to some courses not being transferrable), he knows the difficulty of paying off student loans. He paid his loans off in 9 years because he has a good salary, but usually, it takes people much longer. As some of you know, a lot of students who go to 4-year universities right out of high school end up close to 50k-100k in debt but only earn 30k-50k with their starting salaries. This makes it very difficult to pay off loans quickly because living expenses in America, especially Southern California (where we live), can be quite expensive. So, as you can probably tell, when I think about what my parents are doing for me in this regard (making my life easier by eliminating the possibility of me having debt in the future), I really hate myself for not being able to overlook the issues we had in the past. I can’t bring myself to forget how my parents used to treat me, nor can I joke about that time. For me, those years were full of repressed pain. I couldn’t even tell my friends what went on in my house back then. Yet, I also have a strong desire to succeed in life and make a lot of money so that I can give my parents back everything they’ve given me. In a sense, I want to eliminate the indebted feeling I have towards them, and eventually cut all ties with them. As I mentioned before, I’ve always been a fearful/avoidant person. I want love, but I also want to be forgotten. I want to be acknowledged by my parents, but at the same time, I want to end our relationship as soon as I fulfill my filial duties.
My father had quit drinking many years ago and became a better man. I no longer have anything to hate him for, but at the same time, I have many unresolved negative feelings towards him that have carried on from my childhood. And, as you can probably tell, no matter how much I hate(d) my parents in my heart, those words never left my lips. I never told my parents I hated them during the moments where I felt the truth of those words down to my core. Similarly, I have never once told my parents that I love them.
There were moments in my adulthood where I felt especially attached to my parents. Just the thought of them leaving me or passing away made me tear up. But there was always a wall between us. I wanted them to love me, yet I didn’t want to tell them I loved them. I hated them, but I didn’t want them to hate me. I wanted to be close with them, where we could settle everything from the past and build a new relationship altogether, but I would always create space between us when I felt we got too close. I got so used to being misunderstood and mistreated that now I feel like it’s unnatural and also impossible for us to have a healthy bond.
I’m almost 21 now. I keep thinking about my parents and what they think of me. They treated me like shit when they thought I’d amount to nothing, but as soon as I was attending college and university, they treated me as if I was precious. I felt like I was like an accessory for my parents—something to show off, something to be proud of, and ultimately, something that would change other people’s opinions about them. If I was a failure, that would make them look bad. If I was successful, it would prove their competence as parents.
I don’t know… I just have many unresolved issues. It doesn’t affect my ability to complete my day-to-day responsibilities (school, work, chores, etc.), but I often lay awake at night and wonder why I’m alive.

train_pid_7647	Colorado : I finally visited Colorado to map out the next steps of my life. I’m staying in a dorm with a friend of mine that I’ve known for years via Instagram and finally got to meet her in real life after like six years of video chats and phone calls. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t in love with this girl. I mean she’s everything I expected, and then some. She’s energetic, very smart, beautiful, and we know each other very well. She’s also taken by somebody a lot smarter than me that lives a lot closer to her. I know that if I tried to make a move at this point, it wouldn’t be wise. My spiritual beliefs are what’s keeping me secure. I believe in reincarnation, and therefore if I took her from this guy (or attempted), I’d simply be depriving myself in another life. It’s shitty karma. She’s been letting me sleep in her bed with her (not sexually; we don’t cuddle or make physical contact really of any kind) and honestly it’s enough. This girl makes me want to see the next day, every day. I didn’t actually think I’d ever be able to meet her. It’s almost like Pandora’s box, now. I’ve found something in this life that’s not only worth staying alive for but worth waiting for. She’s told me her and her boyfriend don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things long term. I’m not here to get in the way of her or their relationship. I just want to enjoy this time I have with her because it’s only 11 days until I go back to Alabama. I’m not supposed to see her again until the summer. She wants to come see alabama and visit my home. And then I’m supposed to move up here eventually and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t for this girl. To her knowledge, I’m up here to look at colleges. Maybe this is really cringe but this has been the most bittersweet time I’ve ever had in my life and all I can do is be polite and try to have fun while I deal with all of my own nonsense. It has helped my depression though. It’s given me a little more hope and more will to live. I just hope I don’t fuck up.	not depression

train_pid_7128	"would a therapist accept me, or am I overthinking? : ummm well maybe I'm just in a bad mood right now but this mood comes up a few times a month so I guess I'll share.


hobbies are good for nothing more than killing time. as a teenager I loved creative writing but now when I do it it's more out of habit than any love, passion, or enjoyment.

I don't really understand people who look forward to things - I used to! but, well...

I genuinely believe life is no more meaningful than just killing time and busying yourself until you get to die.

I do laugh and have love a lot. I genuinely don't believe I'm depressed. I function well, wake up consistently, study hard and get good grades. not much of a choice on that front, but I know depression is crippling when it comes to things like that.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to find enjoyment or passion in... well, anything?

I consider my view on life a little nihilistic even though I'm regularly and known to be goofy, loud, and outspoken.

even the shows and books and stuff that I think I love don't really trigger much emotion in me. happy or sad. I feel like any reaction I have to my friends (like: ""GOD IM SO SAD ABOUT [chapter]"") is 100% habit.


TLDR: i dont really feel much enjoyment, purpose,  or strong emotions at all, but i function well and am a goofy person. is there a chance i could get medical help for this despite not being depressed?"	not depression
valid_pid_2156	Seriously contemplating suicide : Ive had sever anxiety, and depression for the past 6 or so years, and this just pushed me over the edge. I moved back into my moms house about a year ago. Since then her cat has fallen I'll, so I've been paying the the cats vet Bill's. Shes going to end up needing a surgery that will cost 2k in a town 5 hours away. My moms house needs around 10k of repairs done or else we are risking out health living in mold. I dont give 2 shits about my health but I want my mom, and her pest to be healthy. She cant afford any of this so I'm obligated to pay for all of it. I personally saved 7k, and I have about 17k in my trust fund, and another 60k in a little while because my brother will be buying out my half of the house. I would just use that money to pay for repairs, and such, but my dad, and mom dont get along, so my dad would be livid if I used my trust fund on my mother's house.

train_pid_8273	"Being single makes everything worse... : My whole life i’ve been alone. I’ve been with handful of women here and there but never anything even remotely  serious. As I grow older (I’m 24) all my friends are settled down with someone. Married, kids, engaged, long relationships.

I’ve always been single. And the sad part is, I don’t know what i do wrong. I’m a good man, passionate about my goals, caring for others, funny, good looking, and social. But i’ve suffered greatly from OCD and depression and even with my wall up, people seem to look at me as insecure or weak (my only justification). It’s almost as if all the good qualities of mine go away. The cycle goes that women are attracted to me when they meet me, but as the weeks go on they get unattracted and put me as their friend.

Over 24 years you have enough of feeling like you’re not good enough. Tired of seeing your friends scoring dates and one night stands. Tired of the random dude at the bar picking up the woman you like. I decided to not even try anymore but it still hurts that EVERYone i know looks at me as the “always single and alone” guy.

train_pid_7980	"Social Media Sucks. : Modern world sucks. I think that’s pretty Fucking obvious. The internet has ruined everything. You’re always subconsciously comparing yourself to everyone else online, it’s hard to accept the fact that you’re not the best looking, most skilled or the most talented person out there. Play guitar or cover song? Someone has already done it and 10x better than you. Have a new idea? Someone’s already done it! Think you look nice today? You’re not as attractive as 90% of the people you see. Simply impossible to compete or to even be noticed, much less appreciated. Because of this your self esteem is just raped but go to take a break from social media and all you’re doing is isolating yourself. Everyone is so connected it’s like we’ve all forgotten how to socialise in real life, at least I have I think. People would much rather text and stay home than to go out and play. 
It’s like a super-internet culture has completely overridden all local cultures and communities. There is nothing unique about an individual’s background anymore. We all act the same now on the internet that has us connected globally. Nobody seems to hold any inherent traditions or values. 
And all this fucking virtue signalling, why can’t you fake bastards Fucking stop? Legit nobody fucking cares how virtuous you are, how altruistic you are, you’re only making anti-racist, anti-homophobic posts to fuel your own narcissistic egos.

I hate a dirty house and love to make fresh home cooked meals, I love working out and losing weight and trying to change my life, I want to be the best mom I can. I slipped hard. My bedroom has all the clean laundry on the floor next to my bed, my sink has a small pile of dishes, I asked my kids tonight what they wanted for dinner because I knew they would say cereal instead of making my meal plan. I haven't brushed my teeth in forever and had my first shower in a month yesterday. I stopped working out, I don't even try to. I barely eat even if I do it's a snack.

Any other time is impossible. I was literally complaining of a sore throat, difficultly breathing, and a fever and she said I couldn’t stay home from school because it was just symptoms. But I’m at least 99% sure it’s fucking not. I literally have the worst immune system of all the people I know! Anytime any sickness is even mentioned of spreading around my area, I already have it.

train_pid_3448	I stay up all night, as if that will stop the next day from coming : The actual act of going to bed is something I dread in very dulled kind of way. Like that interval when you're lying in bed, the lights off, and you're *trying* (desperately) to sleep (which is a bit of contradiction in itself) - that's one of my least favourite moments of human experience. For me that's when the really horrible thoughts come from all sides, and time goes agonisingly slowly, and I'm just there tossing and turning, trying and failing to sleep for what feels like eternity, and it sucks big time. I very much dislike that shit. So what I do is - and it's not really a conscious decision, like it's just what happens, or what I let happen - is I stay up. Late. Real late. To the point where it becomes early. On one level to avoid that moment, so that I'll be so exhausted that I just drop, on another, so that I don't have to face the next day with all its inevitable tedium (a delusion). I whittle away the hours by distracting myself in various ways, like reading, writing, watching things, music, scrolling through reddit, scrolling mindlessly without actually looking at the posts, etc. Anything to not be alone with myself. Anyone else have similar experience? Maybe have some tips? I know I have a surrender problem, I can't let go or be still, and that I should start meditating as a regular practice, and that I need to start being with myself more and communicating with myself more, like starting a journal or something. And get back into regular exercise. And cut down on screen time. But idk, whenever I start doing these things, they quite quickly drop off. It's hard to make changes when you've felt shitty for so long, when you're more comfortable with feeling shitty than working to get better. The devil you know.	moderate

I get a really bad feeling (mentally) around them as if they’re all out to get me. I feel as if I’m just an inconvenience when I’m around many; I go silent, sweat quite a bit and will eventually just drift away from the group.

I don’t enjoy it or get any sense of satisfaction from it. I have to travel frequently for my job. I absolutely hate it. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy traveling just not what my job entails while traveling. Every time I have to travel for my job, I need almost a week in advance to come to terms with it. It’s just long hours and being forced to socialize even on off hours. It makes me more depressed than I already am. To make myself feel better about having to travel, I always tell myself that I will die before we have to go. That’s the only thing that makes me feel better about going. My suicidal urges are strongest at that point. I haven’t actually done anything though.

valid_pid_43	"I cant hide from myself : It comes and goes with the seasons so i at least get a little taste of reality before becoming lost in my mind again. I have matured and my beliefs have changed but depression is emotional and so it is hard to rationalize with. I used to be sad that i havent had sex and im 19 now. But honestly its not a big deal, at least not to me and if someone else decides otherwise, fuck them its my life. My depression isnt really based on thought processes as much anymore its just a deep feeling of loneliness. 
It drove me to a massive drug binge with lots of acid every week for about a year and a half, then a short but intense benzo binge. Acid probably taught me a lot that i take for granted, but i know it taught me one thing, i cant answer these questions with anything that quick. It will always be a slow, painful and confusing process with some beautiful moments.
The benzos stop me from feeling for months. I dont remember a lot of it. During my first semester of college i was almost entirely unconscious. I was effectively the living dead. And then i almost died for good. My friend told me my heart had stopped briefly. But came back as the drugs wore off in time for me to survive.
Since then i cant explain it but ive changed drastically, in some good ways in some bad. I feel as though i did die and this is the new life i am living. And i often have a sensation that a part of me is still in the ""other world"", again hard to explain. But to be frank i saw nothing, just a peaceful unconsciousness. But if theres one thing ive learned, its that no tiny brained human such as me could ever truly understand the nature of life and death, so im gonna stop right their and let mystery be mystery.
The depression is coming back even though i am different now. Its become blatantly obvious to me that these things ive felt for so long cant be solved with things on the outside. Not even the embrace of a lover. I have spent so much time chasing a dream because reality was never enough. 
In the end i cant hide from myself or my nature, for it is what shapes my existence. And as far as i can tell death is the ultimate darkness. For that reason i no longer believe death is better than life. And ive realized its better to experience pain than nothing. You dont get what you want. And you dont know what you need until you've found it. I hope i find that one day."	moderate

valid_pid_969	"Feelings of depression and guilt exacerbated by pandemic : Feeling Guilty About Feelings During Pandemic...?
I'm in Ontario, Canada, so currently we aren't under any lockdown or anything that extensive. However, it seems like we are heading in that direction. I have really poorly managed anxiety, we've been playing with my meds for months now. Almost a year ago I had a pretty serious suicide attempt, and it's been a waiting game since then to try and get me back on track due to the lack of access to the appropriate medical services.
Anyways, I feel guilty for becoming suicidal during the pandemic. There's so much else happening everywhere (there's no cases in my town), that I feel bad for even considering killing myself but that guilt is what's driving me to the edge. I feel like it's only a matter of  time before I snap. I live alone and I'm terrified that if they quarantine us I won't be able to see my caseworker or my therapist. I've been seeing someone twice a week most weeks because I can't make it more than a few days without going into extreme distress. It doesn't help that I'm coming out of a manic episode. I'm  terrified of being locked in my apartment alone, and I'm scared that i don't know what's happening. I don't even care about the virus. If I get it, I'm a high risk, so it might be bad. But we don't have any cases here. I'm more worried about the actions of other people. I have severe gastroparesis and I'm just so done with living a this point because I'm in such a horrible flare. I can't eat anything. The things I can eat everyone is emptying the shelves of (panic buying soup and rice...etc). 
I  don't know what to do.  Ifeel like I can't go to the hospital to reach out for help and support when I'm in crisis, but I also can't keep doing this. My classes got cancelled and I'm thinking that I will be out a job next week most likely (based on how things are going right now) as well...please help I don't know what to do, I know deep down I want to live and that's why I'm reaching out but right now I'm losing all of my reasons.

valid_pid_2886	"I (29F) am a crying babbling mess. Life does not seem to be getting any better. : This time last year my (29F) life was so different. Although I was 30lbs heavier than I am now &amp; really anxious about my job, I was doing well there/in my career, made good money, was headed on vacation to the beach, in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who (I thought) liked me. 
Fast forward to now: I was fired from that job, then I got another job which I was laid off from in December because they got rid of my whole department (still looking for work), still have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and wasn’t shy about it and had no ulterior motives, and I am beyond sad and cry every day. I’m crying writing this. I want to feel better, to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that I go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by, but I can’t. It frustrates me and I feel so dumb. 
Dating: it has been so awful for me. I know that having a partner won’t bring me the happiness I need on my own, I need to focus on myself, my time will come, but I HATE HATE HATE hearing that shit. I have been focusing on myself for the last 29.25 years, and I think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with. And I also hate when someone says but you’re so pretty smart and kind and alluring, you’ll find someone! You don’t know that!!!!!!
I have been noticeably different towards my friends. I decided to open up to one of them and now that I have, I really wish I had just gone with the “I’m fine” response. She is trying to help and I know that I am difficult to even have a conversation with right now. She said if I needed distance then she would give it, but it feels selfish to do that, so I continue to say it’s fine to continue talking. But it hurts to hear about hers (or the other people in my life) increase in pay at her job, her new guy she is seeing, how her life is going so well, when mine is utter and complete shit. And all I can do is compare and it leads to more crying. She says she wants to help me get out of the funk I’m in and that I have every right to feel how I feel but I need to be more positive. I love her and thank her for want to help, but I hate hearing that. Which then leads me back to thinking maybe I should just distance myself. We’ve argued a bit lately. And I know it’s because of me. I’ve become too attached (we talk throughout the day, every day) &amp; I get more anxious when I don’t hear from her. I tried being vulnerable this afternoon and I still haven’t heard from her. But I am resisting sending another text. I absolutely hate how much things like this I s affect my happiness. I wish I wasn’t such a shit person and friend. 
People always suggest gym and eating better as ways to cope. Well the thing is is that I already go to the gym 6 times a week (sometimes daily). There around 90 min to 2 hours. During that time is the only time I am confident, happy, and determined in myself. I feel strong, capable, and on top of the world. But as soon as I leave, it’s back to shit. But if I did not have the gym, I do not know how even darker and more depressed I would feel. Also (I live at home with my parents and sister right now) I haven’t eaten more than one small meal a day really in the past 4 days. I’ve been able to hide it from them. Not that I am trying to starve myself, but when I get really sad nowadays it I think I disappoint my friend or my family, I don’t eat.  
Due to not working and not really having money, I don’t go anywhere. Which leads to minimal social interaction. I did not realize that it would affect me so much. But it really has. On the off chance I talk to someone at the gym, that makes my week because that is usually the only interaction I get. I go to my favorite local bar every so often and it helps just to be somewhere different. But I feel guilty spending a little money on two drinks and to socialize.
I do the the things that they say most people who are depressed usually don’t do: I clean, make meals for myself, shower daily, go to the gym. So then I think to myself,”maybe I’m not depressed? Maybe I’m making this up and it isn’t legitimate. 
And job: I’ve applied, but honestly I have been hesitant to apply to a lot of jobs because I just don’t feel smart enough or capable enough at all. I have colleagues in my field who say I am young, smart and capable. But it doesn’t feel that way given my recent job history.

train_pid_917	I’ve begun to give up hope on doing anything well. I literally cannot do anything right anymore, cannot do anything well. 2020 is just going to be a reminder of how much time I’ve wasted. : Maybe this isn’t right to throw my thoughts out, but I just need to vent I think. With the new year of 2020 here, I honestly feel that I should be something more than I was excluding wisdom gained from aging. Growing up I was a huge gamer and I love games always have. I’ve also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. Then comes 2019, I just lose my ability to do everything. The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly? Moba’s I just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. FPS’s people constantly ask if I’m intentionally deranking. MMO’s I can’t even do the end game content because I just don’t have the items to do it, and I refuse to pay to win. I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to. I lost practically everyone I used to know, and they moved on. Everyone does eventually. I don’t know if I’m depressed but, I feel like my worth is zero to none at this point. I told myself for the longest time, 2020 is gonna be my year, my strongest year yet, I’m a day in and I already feel like giving up. Pathetic right.	moderate

valid_pid_485	"I just started to write a suicide note. (Might be worth a read) : Now, first I want to clarify, that I have no intention of going through with anything. I've been super severely depressed, for a long time now. Around 4 years. That's around the time I got out of jail, had my own place, good job, a good group of good friends. (I might want to add that prior to going to jail I was in a relationship that destroyed me completly and had I had the means to do so, would have taken my life) anyways, Life was really great. And then I started using heroin. I'm 25 soon. I was, 21-22 at the time. Anyways, things went downhill really quickly as I overdosed not long after getting into it. Did that for a couple months, like 2 or 3, and I got a wake up call (super long story, there's so many things I'll have to leave out of this post so I can save some time) but, I ended quitting cold turkey. And shortly after went on a 2-3 week binge, ended up crashing my car almost killing myself and my friends. (I blacked out behind the wheel) fast forward a little, 2 years ago, from present day, I met a girl. And we had a vibe like I've never vibed with a girl before. It ended up being a mistake. And pretty much ever since then, I find little to no enjoyment in my life. I hate myself. Everything I've done, people, and family I've hurt. There's so much regret and guilt, pain and sorrow. Everything's become stagnant. And I don't think I can ever get out of the rut that I'm in. I barely go outside, or go anywhere really. I don't talk to people much, and I barely see my friends or family anymore. (I just stopped leaving my house) i feel disconnected from this world. From all of the people. The only reason I'm still around is because I know what it would do to my family if I were to take my own life. Because the thought of that brings me enough pain, that the pain that makes me want to die becomes irrelevant. Starting to write a suicide note, was a decision I made in order to vent. But, to actually dig into everything that's deep inside. Everything I've buried over the years. All the secrets. Everything. I got quite a lot of it written actually. And it felt good to release all of what I held inside. I think that was the first time I've actually cried since before going to jail, 4 years ago. In the note, I came to realizations, about myself, and my life. My place in my life. The places that I do belong. I was scrolling through this subreddit and to see everyone, all the people that have alot of the same feelings as me, it makes me so sad. I wish I could help all of you, I hope this post helps alot of you.  Here is something I wrote in my note: ""maybe I'm just stuck in a loop. Searching for answers I'll never find, to questions I'll never know."" Obviously this is a paradox. But I feel like it describes so much. To me, it's like a state of nothingness. A place where even I don't exist. And I just want to say, to whoever might be reading this. Please, don't hurt yourself. I understand the pain, the suffering. Having nothing left. All of it. I get it. But, stay alive. Stay alive for you. Even if you feel like you're not even worth that. Do it harder. For the past you""s. And the future you. Always here if you need someone to lend an ear.

I talked to my school guidanc councilor and she told the principal that I was going to therapy for depression and anxiety. She told teachers to consider that when giving out to me for certain things. Like I get really tired because of my mental illness so I get snappy at teachers when they annoy me so they basically give me more of a chance or something.
So I have cbas ( classroom based assessment ) they are basically small projects that go towards your junior certificate and im really stressing over them cuz they give some percentage of my tests. So I was working on my computer turned off. I went to the teacher kinda panicked because I had 3 days to finish ( I'm finished now :D ) and I needed computer to work I told him this and he sat me in a corner of the room and gave me paper and told me to work on I couldn't so just doodled on the paper and got lunch time detention. This was maths.
Then in English I was sleeping after finishing my work. This teacher is usually really understanding. He came up to me slapped the table next to me and said if you wanna sleep get out of my God damn class lemme see your work. Showed him the work he told me it was about what he expected from a 3 year old. I re write it he says it's terrible and that I need to do it for homework. Next day I did more than he wanted me to do ( 250  word essay expected and I done 300 - 350 ) he says he couldn't read the writing and that I need to do it AGAIN I refused got kicked out of class had to go to the principal and she said I should work to his standards.

valid_pid_1914	"This had just started : I've met this one friend of my (he won't see this so Ill call him by his real name) Christian, back in November of 2019. We've been good friends, until he starts talking about this one girl he has been talking to (she won't see this so Ill call her by her real name) sage and I think of the name and it seem familiar but I don't really think about that much and I've seen her before bet he tell me so much about him and her like how they've madeout and how've they had the threesome with a mutual friend named Gabe. Then I went over to his house early in the morning (note they weren't dating, but sage and christian both call sage his main hoe) and she also comes over but he did not tell me she was coming over. I then realized I've known her since third grade she just had blond hair and a gap in her teeth (with at the time I thought was cute) and she still has her speech impediment which I think is cute also. She then remembers me, and I asked christian if they we're dating and he said no, I then asked if he cared if I flirted with her, he said no again. I start to flirt and she flirted back. After some talking we started to talk and he watched us make out which was really weird. Christian, Sage,Christian's sister Karli, and I went to the local park and just messed around because no one was there me and sage were talking and hanging around and I guess christian got mad so he wanted to talk to Karli, so Karli told sage and me to go to the baseball dugout  and when we did we looked around and played tic-tac-toe on the wall and then I picked her up ( mind you I'm 5'8 and she is around 5'3ish) and have her put her legs around my waist and I pinned her against a wall and we made out for a while. Then Karli called us over right before I was going to ask sage out then christian pulled sage aside and asked her out before I could. She said yes too. After walking around some more I went home and cut my self on my right wrist. It felt heart breaking anytime I saw them together but I knew who she was, she didn't care if she was in a relationship or not if you don't give her dick she will find someone to give her dick... Christian had to go home early and Sage had to get something from Dollar General so I went with her. I went home with her and another friend and we went through her camera roll and watched pet cemetery but when the friend left her cat got on my legs when they were crossed and let's say she missed petting the cat on purpose and I pet her pussy on purpose too. A week or two later she calls him later and he breaks up with him and I am not at all the extrovert type so it took a week to even ask her out but she changed the subject by saying I'm going to a fuck buddy's house later. So I felt great after that and we really never talked since and now we're here and I still have suicidal thoughts and want to cut myself daily but Im trying not too but I know one day I wont be able to stop it.
TL;DR My friend tells me about this girl. I hit it off with her her starts to date her she cheats on him with me she calls him a cheater they break up I ask her out she changes the subject and she stops talking to me."	moderate
train_pid_8765	"Depression &amp; Spiraling Thoughts : A little about me...I am a 34 year old female. I used to be a gym rat, working out 6 days a week, taught a class even, I'm a musician, an insurance broker, crazy cat lady and love cleaning...December 2018 I made the decision to leave my husband of 7 years because we simply weren't seeing eye to eye anymore. I started dating someone very shortly after that. I moved into my own place, traded in my car, and then started to get into some financial trouble. Balancing these things all hit me at once. I stopped going to the gym, couldn't even imagine playing my guitar or my piano, the sight of a dish in the sink would throw me into a panic attack...""I have to wash two plates AND fold clothes, *OMG, how*."".....
My dad, over the course of a year, has given me a total of $10k to pay off debts and just generally pay bills ($4k last summer and 6k recently). Out of nowhere, I spiraled into a depression. I've had some pretty bad anxiety for awhile, but as soon as he gave me that second loan, I spiraled out of control with guilt, which quickly turned into a severe depression/anxiety. I have already gone through my 2 weeks of PTO (and more). I can't go to work because I feel like I have the flu all the time, and now I'm scared of being able to able to pay back the loan, make rent, etc. Every day of work I missed just made me feel worse, but the thought of going made me crazy. ""*What is happening to me? Everyone is mad at me, I'm such a disappointment"".*
Every day is a struggle for me. I love my boyfriend, but I feel like my depression is pushing him away, my co-workers are mad at me, and you sure learn quick who your real friends are during a major life change.  I've lost several ""friends"" over the past year, and obviously my ex in-laws are all upset with me - understandable since I was the initiator of the divorce. I also had to leave two cats behind which were my world (sounds silly, but they were). 
Basically, the guilt just eats away at me. I am one of those people that can't stand the thought of people being mad at me or not like me. I cannot just brush it off or say screw it. I care ***too*** much what people think. People that don't even matter to me or have no significance in my life. I think *way* too hard into the future, and worry about everything that hasn't even happened yet. ""It's like I'm trying to control, and protect my future self from getting hurt somehow but I don't even know what those things are. So much so that this why I've been missing work because I was so anxious and depressed that I could not fathom eating, which was making me sick...I can't go to work, can't pay my bills, will get kicked out of my place, my boyfriend will move on, will lose my car, will have to move back in with my parents, and be lonely, sick and sad forever. I will just be known as that ""sick girl"". This is the way my mind spirals out of control on a daily basis. I've seen a psychiatrist, a therapist, had multiple visits with my doctor, so now the doctors bills are going to start piling on top of it. 
Currently I am taking 50mg of Zoloft, which has been beneficial to me in the past (roughly 2014), but I stupidly decided to ween myself off of it around the same time I started going through a divorce. Like I wanted to prove to myself I could handle all of this on my own without the use of medications. *Wrong.* 
I was also taking around 10mg of Ambien every night for sleep and it worked great for me. I had no side effects whatsoever. However, I started to run out way to early. I was sleeping a lot and napping so I'd break them into pieces to take naps. The doctor became alerted to this during our last visit and refused to refill it for me, which of course, sent me into a literal tailspin and severe panic. I was throwing up when I left the office because I was so distraught (and still hadn't eaten). My mind went reeling thinking ""how am I going to function and handle all of this stress if I can't ever sleep, how can I work?"" Literally thinking I would die eventually from exhaustion and depression. My psychiatrist then prescribed me 15mg of Remeron, which seems to have been working ok but it's just not the same. I hate starting new medications. I went through all the classic symptoms, sadness, anger, etc. My parents, boyfriend's parents, my siblings, boyfriend, all started to become worried and concerned for me which made me feel worse. I just feel like I'm going to ""run out of time"" as I keep saying. Basically, that everyone around me is going to abandon me before I have a chance to heal.
This week, I'm back at work and have been sleeping somewhat better and doing my best to stay positive and just focus on work, pushing past the feelings and just trying to enjoy my life day by day instead of trying to fix everything. Of course, my mind is still reeling and I'm still not feeling great, but taking baby steps. Does anyone relate to any of this? Thanks"	severe

valid_pid_4408	"How to cope after decades of depression and no viable hope for the future? : Hello!
I feel a bit of background story is in order.
I've been with depression and GAD since I was about 15 (I turn 33 this year).  
Sometimes it gets a little better, sometimes it gets a little worse.
Except now it's a lot worse.  
Not the worst, but heading there.
I cannot seem to cope these days, thoughts of ending it all are frequent, no matter how much I talk to my therapist (I do talk therapy and have medications), no matter how much I read self-help articles, I take my pills as prescribed, nothing is helping.  
My therapist says that not having enough money is a major trigger for me, which is true, since I grew up poor and am now struggling to make ends meet.
Does anyone have any advice on how to pick myself up when everything around me is broken or sellotaped together? Nothing works and I have no money to fix it...
I am not a materialistic person, I just think I've hit my limit at how much I can take...
For a bit more background: I (F, 32) live in a studio apartment that my grandmother left me, it is legally mine, so I don't pay rent, only property taxes twice a year. I am unemployed and looking for a job for about a year now, but nobody wants to hire me. I live off of what I make by baking cakes for people and babysitting for neighbours. I am not poor, but I think the situation of not seeing a way out of this day-to-day living is getting to me.
I feel so worthless and helpless, pathetic and sad...  
I am willing to work, I promise, only nobody wants to hire me...
I apologise if something doesn't make much sense, I feel jumbled and English is not my first language. Not an excuse, but just know it's not intentional.
Thank you to all in advance, xx"	severe
train_pid_8270	"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.


Thank you so much!"	severe
train_pid_7294	"Something beautiful I found in YouTube comments(I know, right) and just wanted to share it with you guys : Here it goes:
The most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways - except towards themselves.
Always remember this. When you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, don't take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early.
Just pull them aside and let them know it's alright and that we are all lost here. That's all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that doesn't matter, and truly connect with them - even if just for a second - to have a human moment.
Even subtle eye contact can do it. Just don't let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. Cuz they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world.
Depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds - for to them, they are alone. Cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can't connect even for a second. And all they want is to be loved. To legitimately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. They need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves.
They have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. They realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership - and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. To them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. But without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet still feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a TV show and a bowl of ice cream.

valid_pid_2834	"Day 708: What's the point of still being alive. A letter to my dad. : You told me to be honest with you, and I tried to be, but all that did was make you disappointed and upset that I wasn't turning out the way you wanted. When I was honest about my flaws, instead of supporting me, all you did was feel disappointed and dug the knife in deeper, every time. You get angry when I close myself off, and you are upset when I open up. 
I can't help feeling afraid, I'm not as perfect and as achieving as you are. Believe me, I wish I was, and I can already tell that despite all the effort I put in to have an honest discussion with you some days ago when you were upset and angry, you didn't hear a single thing I said. And you obviously don't remember any of it. Your mind somehow can't comprehend anything about me, any of my flaws, the way my mind works, or literally anything about how people work except from your own perspective. How dare you tell me that your life has been awful and that you've suffered. I know you have, and I sympathized once upon a time, but quite frankly I've never received emotional support from you. And despite the craving in my heart for acceptance from his father I know I never will. 
I wanted to do this for you today because I wanted to show I care, but it turns out that it didn't matter. You were going to be upset and unhappy anyway, no matter what I did. Yes, I was thinking of trying to go driving today, and to practice and everything, but I guess it never mattered. Well, if I lucked out and did well, maybe it wouldn't turn out so bad. 
I'm almost 25. I am going to try and kill myself on my birthday. For real this time, I'll have a last day with everything I wanted to do, and then I'll ditch my phone somewhere north and go as far as I can go without anyone else finding me. I think that's fine. It's just hard to rationalize because I'm still making plans with people for next week. Hard to have to explain to them, and I guess to you, how much I will miss being alive. I want to blame you for this, and there's a part of me that wants to hurt you in retribution for all the pain you've caused me that does, but I know it's pointless, both because you wouldn't understand what I meant, and even if you did you'd never be able to comprehend what you've actually done to me. I should know, I've tried explaining to you. I guess common sense really doesn't apply to everyone, huh. 
I don't really want anything sweet for my birthday. If I had to pick a present, it would probably be something like, being happy. Or not wanting to cry so often. Just something small, for me. 
There's so much I really wanted to have said, but I guess that's fine. I don't even know if I hate you, because I don't think that's true. Maybe I do, but I feel guilty about it, because it really isn't entirely your fault. It's a frustration that I was born without parents that understood me, and a world that had no place for me, that I was forced to carve my own path through, and yet it burdened me with things that took away my ability to do so. It feels unfair, but I know you don't care, you never did about the suffering that you saw was beneath your own experiences. I know you never truly understood my struggle with fighting for my own existence, because you flew through it without taking a scratch yourself, and you should be proud of that achievement. If I offer some advice however, maybe don't look down on those who are not having as much luck as you did in getting through your trials. 
I don't know, my suicide might be a wake up call for you, but I highly doubt it. You're =immune to anything that will change your mind, except stuff that proves you're right. If anything, this will just confirm all your worst theories about me. Maybe this way you'll feel freed enough to go and marry someone else and finally live the remainder of your life happy and unrestrained by what you perceive to be the failures of your life. 
I don't know how I'm going to do it yet. But that's alright. I still look back on those times I stood by the tracks. 
It's almost 2 years since I decided that I would try to fix myself. I don't know how far along I've even come, and it feels like I've done nothing good in the time since. 
I held out for almost 2 years. That's more than I deserved or expected I guess. I don't know what I should do anymore. There's plenty of things I can decide to work on but, I just don't think there's any point sometimes. 
2 years. Wow. I feel like that's been long enough, I suppose."	not depression

I am 22 and had a real bad bout of depression when I was 18 and 19. Things have been good since then as I learnt a lot and made things easier for myself. The past few weeks have been great. I finally have a picture of what I want in life. I recently got accepted into a grad school and things in general have been going well but today something just hit me. 
A familiar feeling. My old acquaintance. Ah we meet again. Why, it's been so long, how nice of you to visit today. But I didn't invite you. Oh? You just barged in. Well, guess I have to make room for you today.
It's almost like I forgot what it really feels like. The way it consumes you. All of you. You become helpless; thoughtless; beingless. The lump in your throat. The gravity in your stomach. It's such a unique feeling but I did forget about it, at least for a while. 
Once it hit me, I couldn't help but reminisce about my past. The nostalgia is almost poetic. Most of me hates this feeling but there's a part of me that absolutely craves it. This is why I'm lead to believe that depression is not something you can completely erase. Even if you're okay for a few years, it might creep up on you inadvertently.
I guess what I'm saying is to not think of it as something you wish you didn't have but rather focus on how you can make the most of yourself despite these awful feelings and hope that they go away for a while. I hope that reading this might give you a perspective and help you live the life you deserve.

valid_pid_2046	"I have felt so bad lately and I really need some help : This is my first time posting here and I think I need some advice or something.
So for some backstory my childhood wasn't the greatest. I've been a huge fan of games and movies since I was a little child and yeah I usually got what I wanted but that's not the point here. When I was 5 or 6 years old my mother met her new man and they started dating and so on. Soon after they started to date he was all over me not like in sexual manner but he used to hit me and keep my head underwater and lock me in sauna and even kept me from eating sometimes. And he always did these things when I did something that he thought was wrong like not  cleaning up my room, being late or if I didn't do any homeworks. And he even did it in front of my mom sometimes and she did nothing to prevent it they even had a kid and got married. Of course when my step brother was born i got blame for every little mistake that I made and If my brother fell over then I got the blame and I was hit by my stepfather. Only one who believed me when I told about this was my dad's aunt who was my best friend and who always had my back but she was really old like 80 but she was everything to me back then because I didn't have any friends and I have always been that lonely kid.
When I grew up my dad's aunt died and soon after my grandmother and those two were really important to me and I didn't even cry when they died because all that I felt was deep emptiness that I still feel to this day even though I don't want to admit it. It left a deep void in me that I have tried to fill up for years and sometimes it has worked and I have felt happy but soon after it has only gone downhill. After my ''real'' first relationship in 9th grade ended when she cheated on me and went with another one and soon after that I have always felt really not so good about myself and I even thought about killing myself because life just felt so worthless but then came this another girl who first understood me and tried to help me and she did for a while and so we ended up talking for many months before we started to date and that was the worst relationship that I had ever had because it involved a lot of arguments and she blamed me about everything and I reacted the wrong way and I cheated on her and it left me with so much guilt that after few months it told her about it and I wanted to break up and so after that I avoided relationships and pretty much any human contact for 6 months until a new girl came into my life and we dated for few months and we broke up because I was a real mess and after few months we decided to try again and everything was going on really good until my mental issues surfaced and they pretty much messed up everything.
Well few months I was diagnosed with depression and OCD and I sometimes i get these intrusive thoughts that makes me question everything in my life but mostly it focuses on my relationship. Like those thoughts range from ''You don't feel for her anymore'', ''You don't love her anymore'' to ''just end this relationship'' and it makes me question that do I have feelings for her still. Sometimes I get this feeling of deep emptiness and sometimes it comes when I am alone and when I am with her and it scares the hell out of me. Like I want to enjoy my life with her but my mind struggles so hard to make me feel like that I don't want to be with her anymore and sometimes it feels so real that I even start to believe it. I have told her about these and she has promised to help me in anyway that she can so she is very understanding. This is also concerning to me because we haven't had any problems in our relationship and soon we have dated for a year. She was my ex before but we broke up because I was acting like an asshole and she still had feelings towards her ex so we broke up but then I didn't know about it even though I asked her many times. And when we got back together she didn't tell me about it and I had to find out myself and I felt really bad because she lied to me back then but now everything has been fine in our relationship and we have both worked on those old issues and are no longer keeping secrets but I can't find out why I feel like this. Like is this because of my mental problems or is this relationship genuinely not good? Sometimes I feel like ending everything would be a good choice because then I wouldn't have to feel anything anymore and just be gone from everyones life."	moderate

valid_pid_3124	Years later : Why am I dreaming of her almost 3 and half years later? A little back story,  I had a crush on this girl I met back when we were in 6th grade,  fast forward to my senior year of high school. I still like this girl 6 years later, I finally tell her that I like her,  well I tell her that I was in love with her. She didn't feel the same. I was heart broken,  completely devastated. Any way we graduate, and I go to college and meet a few new girls who I eventually start to have a crush on, mind you I didn't go back to school until a year and half later. But I started to heal and move on, I started to talk to new people and new girls (got rejected by all of them) but the point is I thought I moved on.  It felt like i did. I didn't even think of that girl from hs that I used to like, not at all. So why all this time later am I now thinking about her all the time? I've fr have 4 different dreams about her in the last month and a half.  And every time I wake up I almost cry because who knows why,  but I don't and my chest hurts from all this emotional pain over this.  I even went as far as to ask her years later why she turned me down. She says she never really saw me like that and only saw me as a friend. And I said I get it and completely understood and got my closure to put it lightly. So I got my answer. So why am I still dreaming about her and have feelings for her ? I thought I moved on,  it's been what feels like forever, a lot has happened to me , to make me a better person. I just don't know why I can't get over her. My mind wants to, my heart doesn't.	not depression

I told him i had cried earlier and was upset that i was so lonely, but i put a clown emoji and a peace sign with it to not have it be that serious, cuz I'm a train wreck and had to make it lighthearted somehow. He replied with ""you can go snapchat *[insert my ex's name here]*"" in a serious tone and I started crying then got mad since I blatantly told him i was sad/depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a ""lighthearted mood"" to the conversation. Then he acts like he's the victim because he was insanely insensitive.

I was 12 in 2016, Me and my family were estranged except for the people who lived in my house, and my fathers parents. so it's 6 other people as a support system. I started homeschooling a little before  this point. My mom was getting sicker and was bed ridden and i remember waking up on January 1st with the intent of everything going back to normal and me helping everything smoothly. By the end of it i couldn't walk without crying.   
2017------  
I went through 8 blood tests plenty of mri's some with radiation some without and it they came down to....absolutely nothing. they never found out what was wrong with me and after 6 months of physical therapy they stopped and never fixed my problem....my pain tolerance grew but every step i take hurts to this day. But lets back track a bit to the first week of 2017, one morning my dad came home and he was silent which was alerting. My mother and I were both in her bed together drawing and resting and he told me that my beloved grandmother died and just 30 minutes later my mom would go in for a blood draw and biopsy. So my siblings and i sat in the car well we waited for my mom and dad to come back out of the hospital, i didn't know for a week or two more but my mother breast cancer and had a surgical removal later in the year. Thats all my trauma for 2017.   
2018------  
This year I had depression and 3 different eating disorders but i met the most important person in my life and one of my best friends who we'll call thomas, she has helped me beyond believe will all my mental health issues and its probably the only reason i'm around. We met and talked often and she helped me but my parents all through this were reading my messages and learned everything i said, about my self harm and everything and instead of helping me they yelled at me for hours, invalidating my feelings tell me that  I was copying her and that i didn't have any issues. They started yelling more at me for not cleaning the entire house or doing everything their list said to do. but i got through it.  my parents seperated me from my friend but after a little time I tracked her back down on the internet and were still really close.  
2019------  
At the start of this year i met this guy he seemed really nice and we were together for 4 months before he tried to use me. He tried forcing me into sexual situations and it got really out of hand so i kept my mouth shut and broke up with him. My parents started yelling more at me and my father even called me a fuck up and failure. By the end of the year i was ready to enter the dating pool again and i met this new guy and when shit started to fall apart i realized how wrong i was about him after i found out he was cheating on me with 3 other girls. my best friend of 8 years moved away because her parents couldn't finance the area anymore  
2020---   
this year i was just so destined to live better but my life doesn't operate like that. my parents started taking trips for a couple days and its always so hard when they get back but this was the worst moment of my life. my sister was having trouble sleeping and then he yelled at her and my parents got into a fight and my dad hit my mom. After that moment i'm not sure how i'm suppose to get on...now i don't feel like myself and I can't look at myself in the mirror...i don't recognize the person i don't know if its depersonalization depression or gender dysphoria all i know its i covered all the mirrors because i couldn't stand it anymore i hate my long hair but my dad calls it ""his head"" which makes my mom so mad but what am i suppose to do. it took me 8 years to convince him to let me get my first hair cut. Its hard to sleep i usaully only get 3 or 4 hours a night and I barely can stand having to talk to people. after everyday i lock myself in my room and just lie on my floor and cry for a few hours. I've tried to convince my parents i need help but they think its all fake. even after they saw my self harm marks. i'm not sure how i could make it through the next 2.5 years....they always target me, my sister is the golden child and they buy her stuff and she never has to clean i just don't know how to go on when it feels like the weight of everything is on my chest and dieing would be easier. i can't do any of this anymore its too much. can anyone help me ? i want to keep living but its so hard when i can't even be myself."	not depression

train_pid_7148	Why did I have to make it to 2020 : Like why...why couldn’t I have died	not depression
train_pid_8794	"A bad day? A depressive episode? An overreaction? I don't know anymore. : First I would like to say I'm currently diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety, and since 2016 I am taking 30mg of Lexapro (generic). 
So, a friend and I had been watching a TV show together and last week we watched the final episode. The show itself was dark and emotional, and the last episode was especially emotional because it implied that the main characters had died (they didn't). I felt a bit off afterwards but I just thought it was a normal reaction to finishing a show I liked.
The next day I woke up feeling okay-ish, but as the day went on, I became more and more upset and distressed. I started obsessing over the TV show thinking ""What if they really died?"" and I couldn't stop fixating on it, even though there was proof I was wrong. And even though there was positive things to think about that happened in the show, I didn't care about them, I just focused on everything negative. I began to lose interest in things, things I liked to do or anything else. I didn't want to listen to music, I didn't want to play games or watch videos. I didn't feel like smiling or laughing. I didn't want to eat or drink anything. Everything felt like too much effort. Sometimes I would just stare at the wall and cry because I felt so hopeless. I didn't want to do anything but lay in bed and agonize and obsess over that stupid TV show, my brain just pumping out sad or upsetting ""what if, what if, what if"" questions. This lasted for 4-5 days. 
I felt so stupid and dumb, like ""Why are you this upset over something like this?"". I felt stupid going to the doctor and talking to my therapist about it. My therapist suggested that maybe I've had a build up of stress over the past months and the TV show was what triggered it, and I asked ""Well if that's the case, then why did I just focus and obsess so much on the TV show and nothing else? Why not on the other things in my life?"" and she didn't know. My therapist and mom would say things like ""Well it didn't last that long this time"" and ""Even on medication you'll still have down days"" and I'm just confused and frustrated. So, that's all it is? Was what I went through just a bad day? Is that normal? I have to go through something like that again? I can't watch a damn TV show I like in case something like this happens again?
It didn't feel like a normal reaction, I felt horrible, I didn't feel like myself. But still I wonder if I'm just overreacting about this whole thing. I hadn't had a bad episode in a long time, and I do have a tendency to get obsessed with things that I like. Maybe it wasn't depression, maybe I'm just a sensitive person, maybe this is just something I have to deal with and get used to. I'm just really scared, I don't want to go through that again, and I'm scared that there's nothing that can help me or prevent this from happening again."	severe

valid_pid_4184	Medications... : Hi everyone, I just joined Reddit. As someone formerly diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder when I was 16 (I am 28 now), I was wondering what medication you have found that has helped you manage your symptoms. I've taken celexa, prozac, effexor, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, and seroquel. The one I've taken the longest and had probably the best experience is prozac, but it makes me terribly tired and sort of dulls me out. I'm on 40mg right now, but I'm feeling pretty depressed and hopeless. The current state of world affairs doesn't exactly help either.	severe
train_pid_3509	"Killing myself would be great for my husband. : Today was a bad day and when he came home and all I said to him was that I was not ok he just looked at me and told me he has to work tomorrow and to go take a bath. I sat in the tub in the dark for I dont know how long before I decided to try to break off my glasses and use any sharp edges to slit my wrists. Unfortunately for me, they are cheap plastic and just warped instead of breaking off at the metal part. After a few tries he comes upstairs and just busts the door open (it was locked) and didnt even speak, but I knew he wanted me to put the kids to bed. Since this happened all I can think is how much he probably is just hoping I commit suicide because it's a get out of jail free card. 

He is no longer married to me but no hassle of a divorce 
He can get a new girlfriend he actually wants to sleep with (if he doesnt already have one)
People will always want to offer to babysit when a dead parent is involved so all the free time he wants
He can get rid of all of my stuff and the kids stuff I hold on to for sentiment 

My kids dont deserve a mom who flies off the handle and yells and cries all the time anyways so they will be better off.

train_pid_584	I feel empty. : Nothing fills this void. Friends, family, Nothing. Tried to be Happy, made me feel even more empty. Don't think I've ever been happy a single day of my life. I have gotten real good at faking it and faking just intensifies it. Tried to fill it with relationships and love, worst decision of my life. Now I think I can never love again because what I thought was love was nothing but limerence. Things that I liked doing up until recently now make me feel incompetent. I just want it to end so bad.	moderate
valid_pid_3494	"Boyfriend is leaving me. Why do I want him more than ever? : I’ve fucked up again. Long story short, I have fucked up a lot.... like 16 chances too late fucked up. I am 23 (f) and he is 26. 
It always involves another person. Not always bad. Not ever justified. This last time I responded to an ex who was supposed to be blocked. The conversation was short and we talked about nothing that would be taken wrong or bad. BUT I LIED. I fucking lied. I don’t know why. I was drunk when he brought it up and I just lied and stuck to it EVEN THOUGH I KNEW HE KNEW?!?!?! Why? I even woke up the morning after he saw all of it and I knew, I told my coworker, I knew he knew. I had been SO good. I really truly was happy because I thought I conquered my problems and then one message and BOOM! Life over. Family torn. Future gone. 
Anyways, I have some questions and want some thoughts... before I’ll just give some backstory on me. I have been sexually abused by a couple people close to me before. I used to be obsessed with sex. I wanted to be the best. I wanted everyone to know I was, I was proud but didn’t have many sexual partners. I didn’t have sex easily. Over time it got easier and I slept with a couple I regretted. Well fast forward like 2 1/2 years into my relationship and I stopped having a libido. I got on medicine for depression and anxiety about 2 years into our relationship (too late). Well I got on Wellbutrin to try and help this and it did for a while. Then I upped it because it wasn’t helping again. 
BUT EVERYTIME my boyfriend and I break up like this, I want to have sex with him every second of the day. But I can’t..... is this because I can’t have him? Is it because of my past? What is this? If we fucked more during our relationship we probably wouldn’t be here. What is wrong with me?! Any suggestions or thoughts?! I’m having a hard time finding a therapist because I can’t afford it and the last one I saw I didn’t like...."	not depression

I know I’m not the happiest person anymore, I’ve lost almost all hope and faith, but depression doesn’t seem right. I still go to school, I do my work, I socialize, I sleep right, I eat right, it’s just my mood that’s really changed.

valid_pid_1785	I do not want sympathy. All i want is to people to listen and tell me what they think of it. Even if i am a lost case, i still want to do something of my life. : I was born with a blood duesorder that may or may not be good or bad. Doctors are confusing. I got bit recently by an insect that gave me the Lym disease with my mom. When i talk about my issues, people think that i am negative. I recently entered college and barely made any froends, and those that talk to me don’t care about hanging out(i used to have friends in high school, i was kinda popular in senior year(because popular people adopted me, like we say in high school). Nothing better to do, i join the gym in college(weirdly, this is the thing that actually brings me join and makes me happy. I read and watch videos about fitness and muscle building. I actually smile when i do so. Everyday, i try to change my personality slightly to find one that suits me because i have none. I try and people find me unconsistant because of it. But all i want is to be myself and find people i can call friends who are kinda likr me. But i can’t because i dont even know who i am. Beleive me i tried. But my issue is that whenever i try something, i slowy become good at it and then love it. I am not pretentious, most of the time i adapt fast at things. Im a blob with no personality. No real friend, obviously no girlfriend, nothing special in my life except the gym. And on top of the cake, i am ugly haha. I trued to grow my hairs, but, they just don’t grow. My lips are chapped no matter what i put on it. My face is way more darker than my face, when i don’t even go out.  My eyebrows are small af. The gym is supposed to help but my diet is not on point because i still live with my paremts and thisnmales it really really hard to have a diet on point(don’t tell me to cook for myslef, i tried and it’s impossible in this environment). I wished i was different, i wish i could be better. People out there probably have it worse than me ik. And i am not here to get encouraging comments.

On  Wednesday night, I overdosed on Co-codamol and Citalopram, went  unconcious on my bedroom floor and my brothers found me and called an  ambulance. Woke up in A&amp;E trauma room with an airway tube down my  throat and on a drip. Stayed the next day and night on a ward receving  NAC treatment and spoke to a mental health nurse for about ten minutes. I  didn't want to go inpatient, so agreed to ""home treatment"" instead  (I've been inpatient before and fully hated it).
Turns out home treatment means a nurse came to see me at home for 15 minutes, spoke to me a little and then left.
Now I have an appointment with my CPN in over a week's time.
I'm  just sat at home feeling so alone and forgotten. My family and friends  speak to me still but it all feels so strange, like I shouldn't be here.
I  don't feel completely safe and don't have any plans to attempt  anything, and I do not want to go back to hospital. What options do I  even have now?
I find it incredibly difficult to open up to people and it takes months to start trusting mental health workers.
i  know that if I went back to hospital or rang 111 for my suicidal  thoughts, they'd almost certainly put me back as an inpatient on a  mental health ward. And since I don't want that, what else can I do??

I've been on the Wellbutrin about a month and a half and after the first 3ish weeks of which I weaned off the Celexa, by early to mid afternoon on most days I now crash with fatigue and exhaustion. Also get mild nausea, sometimes a long with the exhaustion and sometimes by itself.
Also I can't say the Wellbutrin is actually making a positive difference with my depression and motivation but I do sleep thru the night virtually every night which I didn't do on the Celexa. The Wellbutrin has also caused intense dreams but never nightmares.
In all honesty I am feeling more depressed due to the fact that I physically feel like crap by evening.

Counselling isn’t helping because I’m not being fully transparent (again because of my trust issues). So what if I score good grades, they don’t matter when I’m dead. I see people who don’t deserve what they have, and I’m here thinking why do I not deserve the same level of joy that they possess. I’m stuck. I don’t know how I’m going to get better.

train_pid_6782	"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

I've had to fight with my depression since I've started college but these past two semesters have been particularly  awful.
 I transferred to a university this semester after being at a community college for 2.5 years and I feel like that may have to do with it somewhat? I also think I'm just very scared and depressed of the future, as I am halfway done and am looking into internships and such. My current semester I'm struggling in all of my classes and it's hard keep up. I dont have the motivation to try and learn what all my professors arent teaching me and I'm terrified to ask for help because I'm afraid of being looked at as a dumbass, which is a really hard thing for me. Aside from that, I find it increasingly hard to be around people and when I'm alone, all I can think about is how I want to  just leave; leave college, leave everything, leave this world. But I want to accomplish getting a degree because that would be big for me. 
The past probably two weeks it has gotten really severe. It's hard for me to enjoy or do anything and sometimes all I can do is lay in bed and try to convince myself not to end it. Balancing college and depression is turning into a losing battle for me at this point and I'm unsure what to do.. I'm constantly going back and forth between trying to keep myself motivated and just feeling like a failure but it seems I'm feeling like a failure more than anything lately.

Where is said adopted mom now you ask? In another state, with her new husband, my older brother whom she manipulated into moving in with her, spending her days lying to all her friends about what a horrible daughter I am for abandoning her, about how her ex husband divorced her when it was the other way around, conveniently never discusses the money she steals from my dad every month,  believing she’s “worthy of it because of the kids I raised”, and hasn’t spoken to me in over a year because I blocked her after she straight up “forgot” to answer a phone call we scheduled to have! 

So yeah. Why should I look at a bunch of books all dedicated to to reminding me how much an adoptive family should love their child just as much as a birth child, when that was never the case for me? And when my adoptive father also has mental problems and a drinking problem but refuses to get help, and complains about how in debt he is and how bad his physical health is when he won’t get any help for that either? Yeah he has to pay my mom a scathing amount every month, but still. He’s admitted he doesn’t wanna work because he’s depressed but he won’t get help for his depression. But still feels the need to say things like, “I don’t know how much longer I can do any of this.” And talk about losing is job and if he does will definitely lose our house. See, I don’t get to talk about my problems. Cause I clearly don’t have any. But everyone else sure as hell does!

I had the pills in my hand, took half of them and ended up throwing them back up before I could get the rest down. I hate living and it’s too painful to keep trying and falling back worse.
I’ve been through intensive therapy, been admitted and sectioned before; none of it has helped, nothing releases my pain or anger; I just end up making it worse.

Overall I have a good time at work since its really the only place I ever go that is ""social"". Today I got so overwhelmed with not only a clog of my own work but busy helping others because they were in the space I needed and the area itself was a complete trip/fall hazard. I spent 45 minutes helping another department while those in that department disappeared. I got so frustrated and upset I just started crying and once I cry there is no hiding it because my eyes turn super red like I'm stoned out of my mind. One of my supervisors came and checked up on me multiple times once he found out. And several coworkers gave me hugs and one even took over what I was doing so I could take a 45 minute break instead of the usual 10. I wanted to spend it alone in my car and when I walked outside I remembered I didn't even drive to work today so my car is at home so I sat in the basement instead of the break room. Back to my supervisor because this really made my day and it meant a lot to me: the last half hour in the shift he pulled my aside and wanted to makw sure nothing happened and that he didn't put too much pressure on me because of what was happening(he didn't) but the fact that he seemed to genuinely care about what happened and what he could do to make sure it didn't happen again meant a lot."	moderate

There is nothing in this world besides my love for the game that I wouldn't sacrifice to achieve this dream of mine; I would willingly sacrifice any family, friends, lovers, in order to achieve this.

train_pid_853	"First day of a a new year full of old shit : Ever since I was about 14 I started to realize that what I was going through wasn't normal. I was (and still am) extremely depressed, but it came in waves. I am 17 now and have tried to kill myself 6 times and ended up in the hospital 4 times. My family has in no way supported me and constantly  tries to put me down. Everytime I try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention.

They make me move schools about every 5-6 months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. Currently they are home schooling me which means I sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about 10 hours. I cannot go outside and all social activities are banned I guess you would say. Everything in my house is under lockdown. For Christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. I have to ask for everything and most times the answer isn't just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture.

Going into this new year I cannot think of anything good that's going for me and I genuinely feel like trash. I got a really bad 'wave'  of pure helplessness and started to cut myself, I stopped myself before it got too bad but my arm is currently fucked up again.

 I dont know what I'm doing with my life and I sure don't know what I'm doing here. I guess I'm just hoping I'm not the only one going through this.

valid_pid_1138	"Tips for beating depression : Hi guys, 
I have moderate to severe depression since about 2013. In the last 3 years I have found myself ruminating about past trauma and embarrassments non stop. I have tried CBT, albeit only for 8 weeks and have tried Citalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine, mirtazapine and qutiapine. The only small success I had with these was with the latter, before my depression just came back harder.
Does anybody have any suggestions? I am thinking of paying for private CBT sessions, probably over a 12 week period. Are there any other medications or ways u can think to beat this?
I am a fairly active 23 year old male with a fairly good job and social life. I play football and go to the gym. From the outside I feel many people would think I’ve got a great life, which makes it even sadder. 
I feel as if I’m getting to the end of my tether with this and I can’t imagine progressing in life and starting a family etc with my current state of mind, very worried.

I’m doing an outpatient program which is helpful and all but I always want to cut myself. I don’t want to die but the urge to cut is overwhelming. A plus, I think all my friends hate me. Before I was inpatient I was going through a really rough time with a few people at school and they really abandoned me when I needed them most. I mean they just really shit on me when I already wanted to kill myself. I told my friend that I wanted to kill myself and was pretty convinced that I was going to and he shrugged it off. Didn’t tell anyone or express concern which was disappointing but I guess you can’t ask people to always do that right thing. Luckily I broke down and therapy and ended up in the ER before I could overdose on ativan, trazedone, and vodka.

valid_pid_2270	"40 and empty : I'm able to take care of work, bills and act upbeat at work and in certain social situations, but when I'm by myself or with my girlfriend I feel frustrated, upset with myself and sometimes have thoughts of suicide.
I feel out of love awhile ago, feel guilty to admit. The woman in with seems to be my biggest fan and puts so much faith into me. Maybe my perspective is off, but I really think that she is emotionally dependent on me and it's a drain; I'm her only friend it seems. I feel obligated to keep her happy and entertained; it's exhausting.
I always thought that if I hit a certain mark in my career, gained some sort of financial independence (I have these things now) that this feeling of dispair would go away, but it hasn't. (I laugh at myself that I'm motivated to write this BS on a Reddit post...it's therapeutic in a way).
Some history: depression does run in the family. Lost my sister and an uncle to suicide. My father made an attempt. I used to cut, but now I strike myself in the head when I get frustrated. I was addicted to methamphetamine in my earlier 20s and have been clean from that about 17 years. Last year I suppose I broke my sobriety with psychedelics; they've admittedly been very helpful. I am able to see things clearly.
Not sure exactly where I'm going with this, but was just curious to see if there was a subreddit on depression and now that I see there is, I felt motivated to share a bit.
Take care everyone.

I want to become an entrepreneur artist, but my circumstances are making it pretty hard for me to keep a good mindset, causing me to think of suicide when it comes to the worst sometimes, ofc I would never do it, I'm not crazy. Anyways, I can't do what I want to do because of the decisions of others on my life, aka, my mom (and kind of my dad). They want me to go to community college... I understand that but I already know what I want to do with my life, it's like they're not confident in my ability to become who I want to become. I am currently not working, it's hard to find a job around my area for some reason idk if it's cuz I'm  stupid or my resume is trash or I look like a garbage worker idfk.. anyways I can't get a job it seems but I feel like I can still work, as a doordasher. But here is another problem, I need a license... I have a permit so my dad teaches me to drive sometimes but now he can't teach me as much because he has gotten ill and now he has to go to a hospital a couple hours away from where I live. I can get driving lessons but they cost $50 per lesson, and I don't have the money to do that and my mom is close with her money so she can't pay that very often so it seems I won't be getting a driver's license for a while. I'm literally on my last foot here, idk what to do, I'm stuck, depressed, I stay inside all day, trying to build my tiny ass fanbase on instagram, I've moved away from all my friends everything I've known and I'm dealing with some crazy shit in my head everyday.

valid_pid_1803	"It sucks being the back-up friend : I have a group of friends I've kept in contact with from high school, and we all just graduated college. Fortunately for me, everyone moved to the major city where I attended college and decided to stay. We've mentioned how fortunate and lucky we are that all four of us stayed in touch, actually liked one another in high school, and up to now in the beginning of our young adult lives, but sometimes I feel like the odd man out. 
Like last night, I saw that the three of them went out, and I didn't get the invite, which was fine. But then this morning, our group text was used to talk about brunch plans and everyone was chiming in, which is great. Except the last text in the group before that was me trying to make brunch plans and nobody answered, which makes me feel like nobody wants to hang out if I'm the one initiating plans. Then, they started talking about things that happened last night, and so when I finally just said ""I'm lost,"" one of them explained the situation to me and said that it was an ""impromptu meetup."" 
I may just be overanalyzing this, but the only ways I see the impromptu meetup happening are if they individually texted each other and just didn't want to invite me or that there's a separate group text where I'm left out. It just really stinks because I genuinely think of these guys as my best friends, and I was so excited to have them here in my city. It's selfish to say, but with this happening, it feels less like my city to me and more like theirs where I'm a side character.

As I said I make a lotta jokes about myself, and people think that they can too, seems logical, yet it isn't, I can't take it, people make fun of everything I do. Even when I find the courage to tell them I'm not ok, which is hard considering I got SA, they somehow making fun of it later on.
One time one girl I really thought was one of my best friends, along with a tiny bit of help from her friends, single handedly managed to make try to jumper under a speeding car (I didn't get hurt). It didn't seem like me, I never thought I would try to kill myself, even in my darkest times. 
Shit got worse when her two friends were trash-talking me directly in front of me, while I was in midst of a mental breakdown that nobody was even remotely trying to stop. They said that they were dissappointed about my ""asshole behavior"", which was literally a fucking mental breakdown FFS.

 I dropped out of college this semester due to depression. I came home. Now my anxiety has overwhelmed me. So many thoughts running through my head. I have no friends back home to hang out with. I don't have social interaction. I got turned away from an amazing job opportunity and it really took a blow to my self esteem. I have to mentally prepare myself before any social interaction now. I literally get drained from social interaction after the tiny bit of it that I have during the week. I lost interest in things I formerly enjoyed. I sit in bed every single day. 
My sleep schedule is awful. I sleep 12-14 hours a day. However tonight I sit here before you all writing this at 6:39 am. Why am I awake you ask? Because I have to change the oil in my car at 1:15pm today and I have been dreading the social interaction from it all night. How pathetic is that. 
But as I sit here in tears for the billionth time of my 18 years of being on this planet, I've come to a realization. 
I am just a number on this planet. I mean nothing. I have the same worth as the ant on the street that you crush under your shoe. I have the same worth as the zebra being tackled by a lion on the Serengeti, that you watch on Nat Geo. I have the same worth as the mosquito that you slap off your skin during summer nights. None of them have names, no one remembers their stories. The only thing people remember in each of these scenarios is their deaths. 
People in my life have talked about where they see themselves in the future. What job they have, if they get married or have kids, where they'll live. Me? No matter how hard I try, I see nothing in my future. Black. 
Over the past few years, I've gotten this overwhelming sensation that my time on this Earth is extremely limited. Like, i won't make it past my twenties. These past few days, I've started to dissociate, I have vivid intrusive suicidal thoughts that have started to make me realize that my time may be coming to a close. Nothing feels real. I feel like I'm floating. 
I'm too much of a coward to purposely harm myself. But the thought of being dead and not feeling anything really brings me immense comfort. I can't explain it, but it's an intense warm feeling that I've never felt before. 
I'm scared of what I just wrote, and honestly I'm scared of how others will perceive it. But I have no one else to share my words with. And maybe if I do end up passing on soon, someone will come across my post on this sub and read just a fraction of what runs through my mind.

I used to be a high achieving student in high school in academics and athletics. Now I am a washed up bum who can not perform the simplest of tasks correctly; I am so pathetic. I had such high hopes of using the ivy-league college I worked hard to get into as a spring board for a successful career, but I have already failed miserably. I do not have the skills one needs to make it in the real world.
I feel so lethargic and weak. I struggle my way through sports practice everyday. I do not know how much longer I can keep going. I wish I could just disappear and never be seen by anyone again.

train_pid_6799	This sucks. : It's starting to get to the point where nothing seems real. I'm waking up day after day and it seems meaningless. I have a girlfriend and a beautiful daughter, but I always have this feeling of impending doom. Sometimes I find myself completely looking through people, not on purpose, but because I'm so deep in thought about death or loneliness and how inevitable either one is. I'm just stuck in a rut I can't pull myself out of.	not depression

valid_pid_1784	"Final thoughts. Just wanted to deposit some feelings. : I don't know why I'm here and I don't know if this will make a difference.
But I really just needed to deposit some thoughts.
I'm tired of (this) life. I've got no real friends and don't really feel connected to anyone. It's always been like this and I've always been the odd one in every social group I've been. I just haven't felt sincerely understood for a while and I just can't find happiness in things anymore. I feel like a monster, I'm miserable of myself. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore at this point. Every day is just worse and worse, I just feel so humiliated and embarrassed about myself, I've got nothing and no one. I've always been an outcast, and I feel like I just wasn't supposed to be (and I actually was an accident indeed, I found out recently). This phase of my life has been going on for the past 4 years of my life and I'm tired of fighting myself and lying to myself everyday that things will get better.
I'm not stupid, I know that nobody sincerely wants to listen to my struggles, and if anything I can't blame these people, I wouldn't care about myself too if I were them. Not even professionals, who get paid daily to help you cope with these kind of things actually care about your well being at the end of the day. Nobody cares about me, it's simple, I've always been that person you go to because you're friends aren't around (or you don't even have any). And I've always been that person that you'd pick the last on the team when you're a captain of a sports game. You wouldn't notice me if were gone, in fact, you wouldn't care or even be happy, some of you have even explicitly told me that you'd wish I were gone. 
I'm not good at anything and probably won't ever be, I just don't have anything to be recognized for. I offer nothing as a person and if anything I feel like a deadly weight to the people I care about, everyday. No matter how hard I've tried, I've tried both my hardest and not at all at times. People just don't like me, no matter what I do. I dislike myself too, I'm tired of this life, I'm just tired of all of this. I'm contemplating suicide, but just haven't figured out when and where to do it. I know sooner or later I'll probably go through with it though. This pain is just stronger than any emotion I've felt in my life. Yes, I've tried meds... but if anything they made it just harder for me to naturally find joy in things.
I see all these talented people commenting on here about how they're feeling the same way as I do, but sincerely they just deserve the world. I'm one of the few people and probably the only person who deserves to feel this way, because I'm just a miserable person. 
I just wanted to get my feelings out there and want some of you all to know that you're not alone in this and that I sincerely think you deserve the world! I couldn't ever wish my pain to anyone. And please, if you read this, treat yourself well. 
I'm sorry. Goodbye."	moderate

train_pid_5946	"Descriptions : I tried my best to describe how I feel when trying to fall asleep some nights, putting it in words and posting it somewhere really helps, even if nobody really gives a damn in the end 
You turn off the light in your bedroom, and place your phone on the charger. The math has been done, if you immediately go to sleep now you'll get exactly 6 hours of rest before you have to wake up. Upon hitting the pillow, you just lay there.
It only takes a few seconds, before you partake in the most dangerous game, actually thinking. All of a sudden, you feel a wave of sadness rush over you, seemingly originating from your stomach. Feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and pure sadness.
""Why am I sad?"", You ask yourself. You lie there thinking, but you really can't find a good reason. Before long, you are thinking about your entire life. ""What am I doing wrong?"", ""Why do I struggle so much to socialize?"", ""Do I hold any real value to this world?"", These questions are racing through your mind.
If you dropped dead, would anyone mourn? Probably, but would they really? No, but yes they would? All you can do is go back and forth, thinking of ideas and immediately doubting yourself and your own validity.
Don't even bother asking why you are like this, and then a wave of anxiety rushes over you as you remember you were trying to sleep. How long has it been? You think about reaching for your phone, but you don't.
Even though the phone is right there, to pick it up feels like it requires a mountainous amount of willpower and strength. After 5 minutes of thinking about picking up the phone, you finally do. 
3 in the morning, nice going dumbass. Do you really fuck everything up like this? You know you're worthless, and now you're going to be tired all day tomorrow. I applaud you, actual braindead moron.
As you realize you were thinking those thoughts, small amounts of anxiety and pain flutter through your stomach. You must have something deeply wrong with you, but things are slowing down and not making much sense.

I live at home with my parents until I graduate and get a stable job. I my grade have been slipping for about 4 semesters now to the point where my gpa is a 2.0. I recently left my minimum wage job because the place was pretty volatile. I don’t have a drivers license because school eats up my time and I don’t have a car to practice with most of the time. I’m a virgin who uses dating apps to try to date girls since my area isn’t a city of college kids my age or anyone inherently my age. I always see People my age are already in a relationship or have something going for them in life. Try when it comes to dating but what I found in dating apps are a bad idea for me since the people aren’t invested no matter how long you make a connection or invite them out to eat.

If I try to arrange something people bail or make up excuses and I then see they went with others. So I just kinda stopped trying and gave up because it almost hurt more when I tried and then failed.

I've been struggling with a lot of anxiety and depression lately and things have all been going wrong professionally so that's been amplifying the stress, and I feel like I shouldn't be where I am for school and have this massive impostor syndrome going. Cap that with a boyfriend who is extremely confident in his looks and determination and intelligence who completely wrecked me with his grades and I just don't feel adequate.

valid_pid_4479	"Coming up on my one year anniversary : I was committed a year ago because I had a detailed plan. Have had major depressive disorder all my life, but it got progressively worse after I was dragged back to work (in a job I hated) two weeks after major surgery, and 8 weeks before my surgeon wanted me to. That's a pain and a weakness I wouldn't wish on anyone. I was in a wheelchair for two weeks so I could still do my job, but I'd feel my muscles tremble from sitting upright after only 30 minutes.
Husband (who can be the world's biggest jerk, and I refuse to defend him in this instance) declared ""I wish you'd just kill yourself when you say you want to"" during an argument that only he wanted to have (he didn't think I should have lunch so he'd have more time to play cards, where his parents were going to feed him. He really sounds like a major abuser, and he was and can still be). I kicked him out that day, and was going to go to work, then come home and take a hot bath. I figured it was the largest chunk of time before I'd be missed.
Luckily, I had a counselor who knew something was horrifically wrong. After prodding, I spilled it all. She helped me get admitted to the hospital and stayed with me until a family member could come take me. I was scared sick, because my mom always stigmatized being committed because it would ""end your teaching career forever."" Can't have that, can we.
While I was in the hospital, it all stopped, and it was insane for me. I knew I hated teaching, and I hated my job. I hated it all so much. I hated that I was constantly called to put my job and my husband's bank account ahead of my own sense of fulfillment. Visiting hours were great, by the way. My mom and sister knew what my husband had said to me, and no one was their usual warm selves to him. In therapy sessions, I talked out what would happen if I abandoned my teaching career. It occurred to me that I still have the people skills, the problem solving, connections, etc, etc. When my certification expires... I don't have to renew it. The idea of a traditional classroom filled me with so much dread...
I told my family, and the same day I was released, I went to my boss (who I loved, it was my big boss that demanded I return to work. She's loved by no one). I didn't bother with changing anything about my clothes, except to put on certain clothing items they confiscated. And I informed her I'd be quitting at the end of the school year. Period. 
Two months into my unemployment, while we were in Japan (long story, don't ask) I was thinking about what my therapist had once asked me: ""What would you do you if you knew you couldn't fail?"" Well, I had wanted to be a veterinarian when I was a kid up until I was 17...and then my depression told me it would never happen. I was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. I talked to vets, I read every SINGLE book I could find, it was my thing. I was that kid that people would bring their animals to look at, and I could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they'd be mentally prepared for the bill. Vet school was out, but I had researched veterinary tech programs while I was a teacher: the problem was that they were all full-time programs during the day. But hey, that was no longer a problem! I burst into tears when I realized that I HAD figured out why I needed to stay: I had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me I had to. I applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in Tokyo Bay. (Husband, who didn't know me back when I was Weird Animal Girl, thought this was impulsive and out of nowhere. It wasn't until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it wasn't impulse. Mom said ""oh, thank God, that's what I've been waiting to hear for years."" She told my grandpa and his response was ""It's about damn time!!"" He had to realized that oh, no. This was a huge part of my personality he hadn't noticed)
I started classes three weeks later. Every day, I am JAZZED to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing I've always wanted. For the first time since I went into teaching, way back in 2009, I feel hope. I still struggle with depression, obviously, especially because I've lapsed on therapy (fricking copays)...but I maybe found the thing that will keep me going.
Being admitted really did end my teaching career forever."	severe

train_pid_4857	"Just a couple of feelings. And, ""hello, friends!"" : It's January 1st, 2020. I have never published anything in Reddit before, but I found some posts here that encouraged me to write a little on my feelings.

I have just graduated from high school in November (I am not American nor living in Europe). Now I am about going to start my university studies. I am quite young, most of my colleagues were older than me, and I am younger than the average first-year student in almost countries. I always felt somewhat misplaced and disinterested in what young people do.

I didn't attend my class's prom party. At first, I was thinking financially, as it is not rational to expend a truckload of money in a stupid and small event. My mother got really upset with my decision, but I didn't dare to explicitly say that I was worried about getting us into debt. After some months, my motivations to not attending it was not having established friendships with most of my classmates; I had a few moments of unpleasantness with some of them, but I have no contempt for almost anyone. It was an elite school, with only eight people in the class, most of them extremely affluent.

As well, utter all compliments I hear is about how smart I am, and I have a gracious complexion. I fell as having no true friends - since I was little I got to be surrounded by adults. Today, I was invited by a friend to some museums with her, but I do not feel as sharing secrets as I never could open myself on the pains — physical and psychic ones — to someone. Every day, I fear ending up alone, as I am too avoidant or critical, applying the latter both to myself and to the significant one, and I do not have hope on a great career or in a profitable marriage (I live in the western world, but marriage for convenience is appealing.)

My father quit his job and now tries to succeed in life as a businessman, but the economic scenario in our country has never been good. This past year, my mother, who worked from home for a few years, went into a stable job, but it does not pay too well. Through the year, I tried to make some money — I intended to start investing and also to create an emergency fund, but I always dreamt about moving abroad — considering I am going to study Mathematics and Astronomy; I live in a hostile place to be a scientist, and there were a lot of relatives of mine setting up our documents to live in Europe. I started to spend a lot of money using credit cards, but it was necessary, and then I have to start my savings all over again, after paying what I owe the bank.

My dream university changed its calendar to entrance examinations in a way that I could not be admitted. I am going to matriculate myself in one of the most prestigious university in my country, as it has no tuitions and a demanding pace of studies, and studying abroad is no longer affordable. I have thought a lot on not studying Astronomy — or something as Fine Arts or Philosophy, my other passions — in favour of something that has chances of getting rich, as Medicine.

I cannot take anymore what made me feel so out of place these past few years — I don't have a boyfriend, I don't go to those promiscuous, opulent parties, and I don't travel around the world during the summer holidays. I can no longer delay my visits to doctors for not having the courage to tell someone what I feel, that my allergies weaken me more than ever, that my eyes burn like hell and every inch of my body hurts, and the fear of going to a psychiatrist. I tried therapy a few years ago, and the therapist was able to make me feel worse, as the school educational coordinator.

I am always afraid of not being sufficiently grateful for what I have on Earth, that I have a great background. Poetry can make my breath somewhat lighter, but, consonant to my vision issues and to the stress I was subjected to, I was reading fewer books. I started to believe that I can only hold my life with missions to accomplish, and creating art, fortunately, was a solace in the plethora of trouble I got into, maybe for my future good."	moderate

train_pid_7452	"A letter to my best friend : Dear sister,
We were born in different families but fated to meet.
I was so shy back then, so afraid of the world and how everyone thought of me. I was bullied for my differences from the crowd. I hated life back then, between the bullying and the abuse back home.
And then like an angel, you appeared. You spoke to me as if I was human and showed me empathy. And although I never asked, you stood up for me and wiped away my tears.
You were so beautiful to me, like a goddess and like the best friend I could ever wish for. Of course you had your flaws, don't we all, but i adored you despite them.
You were always so intelligent and bright but stubborn and short tempered. 
I know at times you do not feel loved but do you really need a lover to realize just how loved you are? Just how special you are? You are incredible in so many ways.
What makes you special? Your big and loving heart. Its not easy to see past the cover of a book to see its real beauty..but you..you do that better than anyone I know.
I know life is hard and you're fighting a hidden war but you always were a fighter- a warrior.  Look at the battles you've faced and how much stronger you are because you never gave up. I've always been proud of you for that.
I know it is not much to offer but because i love you whole heartedly, you will always find a friend in me"	not depression

I’m from the golden state. Don’t worry about timezones because I’m never asleep on time. I pull all nighter quite often so if you need someone to talk to at odd times, there’s me.
I like lots of things, most recent thing I’ve been excited about is the season 5 release of Better Call Saul. Have you seen Breaking Bad? Favorite show of all time, not sure if anything can top it. 
Before you ask I’ve only watched two anime’s. Castle in the sky and Assassination classroom. I watch all kinds of movies too mainly action and animated. My favorite music is Japanese city pop from the 80’s or just 80’s music in general. 
What I like to do varies on my mood but I’m passionate about film, I want to make a movie. I’m actually in the process of making one. Don’t ask what about, none of my movies have a true plot to them; I suck at writing. Any of you seen killer bean forever?

train_pid_6944	"Depression is a chronic illness : My sister’s friend just got diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 19. She had to have her thyroid removed and will be fine, but it will be something she has to deal with for the rest of her life. She has gotten an outpouring of support from friends and family, just hundreds of people showering her with love. She has been very open with my sister and her other friends about how hard this has been for her, throwing off her life plan and setting her potentially on a difference course.

I feel incredibly bad for her and recognize how horrible and life-changing this is, but I also can’t help but feel a little bit jealous. Jealous that she can be so vocal about her frustrations and her illness and receive nothing but empathy and love from absolutely everyone. 

I (22) developed major depression at about 19 and it completely destroyed me and my life plan. It will be something I have to deal with everyday for my rest of my life, and I will never be the same. But I don’t get to talk about it with people. 

While my sister’s friend is labeled strong for dealing with her cancer, I’m labeled weak for being depressed. People view her cancer as a problem she deals with while instead viewing me as a problem for having depression. Even people who are generally sympathetic and kind still think this way and it shows in small ways. Even my parents who are supportive and loving see my persistent depression as a failure on my part. 

I used to be beautiful, smart, and advantaged. But now I can’t sleep, I can’t think, I can’t enjoy anything, I can’t form meaningful relationships, and I see absolutely no future for myself. 

But worst of all, I can’t talk about it because to other people it’s something I’ve done to myself."	not depression

train_pid_3447	"I've never felt so down or broken before. I really hate life. : I really miss my parents. My dad died almost 26 years ago when I was 13. I loved hanging out with him at work. He showed me so much. Every young person needs a dad like him. It was so devastating when he died. The doctors kept telling me he was going to be alright. I was just a kid. I didn't know better. It blind sided me when he died. My mom slipped into a deep depression. A couple of years after that she walked out on me. I lived a long time alone before I reconnected with her. I can remember my friends getting birthday presents, being with family at Thanksgiving. It was an insane feeling getting used to just being alone. There were a few girlfriends but nothing serious. It's proven impossible to find a woman that will love me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last year of my mom's life I was dating what I thought was the love of my life. When my mom got sick and was hospitalized I needed someone to talk to. I called my girlfriend at the time but she wouldn't pick up her phone. Didn't respond to texts. It didn't take long to figure out she was cheating on me. It was a crazy situation. She was messing around with a married guy and the guy's wife spray panted my now exgirlfriend's car. Police were calling and there was a lot to deal with. Shortly after my mom died I received an audio file. Someone recorded my ex-girlfriend talking on the phone with someone about how she didn't want to deal with me and my mom's death. That she didn't have the time and better things to do. It was unbelievable how cold. I buried my mother alone. The time I should have been spending with my mom I was talking to the police until they figured out who was harassing my exgirlfriend. She destroyed the mourning time I should have had for my mother. This is something that I was carry with me for the rest of my life. 

This was a year and a half ago. I've been alone ever since. I've lost my sex drive and have nothing but contempt for dating. I've been in therapy but to be honest I don't think it working for me. I think this situation isn't what most therapists deal with. Someone that's been alone like I have and lost what I have probably isn't fixable. 

I got a text recently from my exgirlfriend. She was begging me to meet her somewhere so she could apologize. I blocked the new number she texted me from. I don't want to see or hear from her again. 

I have moments when I want to get out there and meet someone. I'll even go as far as to create a dating profile or go out where single people hang out. But when I look at women I just see this unreliable thing that's just going to hurt me. I'm just reminded of my failures in dating and how every girl that's been with me just wanted to find someone else with complete disregard to my feelings. It would be different if things just didn't work out. If I could get a ""Sorry but this isn't working for me"" speech. That you can't argue with. That you can get over. 

I've never felt this broken or sad. I feel like since she cheated on me while my mom was dying in the hospital then who can you trust? Now it's too late. When I needed someone the most they screwed me over. The world had it's chance to impress me with it's compassion but it showed me how horrible people can be instead."	moderate

valid_pid_1051	Why does food always work for my depression : I’ve tried medication, therapy, and I even went to a crisis center to get help with my depression.

Even before I got professional help, I would always rely on food to make me happy and it always did. Every time I eat, I feel so much better. Even though, people call me a pig and tell me to lose weight, I don’t give a f. As long as I don’t get obese, I just want to rely on food. It’s the only thing that makes me happy.

Maybe I've finally lost it. Full blown personality shifts. Thoughts that aren't mine. Opinions that aren't mine. Maybe I've gone insane and don't know it yet. Don't know if I even would.

I was in contact with a couple of therapists but i dont think they can help me. When i  was around 16 i found another girl who at the time reminded me of myself and i fall in love with her. We had been together for 9 years but i started to threat her badly at the end i dont know why i did this but i did. She became clincal depressed because of me and i could not see me as the reason behind it. She left me around a year ago. I have to say about that that i have extrem social anxiety and dont leave my appartment at any time only in the mornin at around 8am when i have to buy food. My mental state since that has became worse and worse. I started taking drugs and drink alkohol on a daily basis because i cant deal with being responsible for her state. A couple months ago i started to cut myself and had 2 suicide attempts by taking 100 painkillers the first time and around 130 the second time. Right now i am back home from a long walk thinking about jumping infront of a train. I work a deadend job in a office where everyone makes fun of me on a daily basis and i have to pretend that everything is fine or else they fire me because i used to almost get violent against my coworkers when they started to tell me i do this for attention and that there is nothing wrong with me. Every single day of my life is constant agony i wish i would just die. My daily life outside of work consist of playing games and taking drugs/getting high to keep me distracted. On a weekend i spend around 16-20 hours a day on my pc watching series from my childhood and while thinking of better times. I dont know why i really write this shit here but i feel like theres nothing else i can do. I am sry for bothering all of you.	moderate

valid_pid_4147	"My life story : I guess Ill start from the beginning...
I was born in late 2004 my mother was then 17 almost 18 my father was 32 and had no clue what he was doing with his life and no he was never reported for being with a minor but he was with another woman of around the same age of my mother at the time and my sister who is older than me by a couple months was born my mother imediatedly got custody of me as my dad did not want to get caught while in court around the time I turned two or three the other woman figured out about me and my mother and soon had my then youngest sister after divorcing my father my father was extremely abusive towards me only untill i was about 8
Around the time i turned 4 or so my now youngest sister was born from my mother to a physically abusive man who abused me and my mother and was eventually locked away for battery charges and last I heard is wanted in my state 
When I turned 8 I was diagnosed with ADD for those of you who dont know what that is its the opposite of ADHD pretty much im always tired and i was prescribed Adderall my mother who i lived with soon found a new man who in time also showed his true colors and was abusive to me and mother did nothing 
My mother soon started using marijuana and was cheating on her then fiance with our neighbor i was then around ten within the next year my mother was hooked on meth and I was then moved into her mother my grandmothers house leaving my sister behind not too long after that I was prescribed Zoloft for depression and ADD 
I am now 15 no longer on meds other than a couple assorted supplements for sleep issues and my sister is also moved in with us  i have better grades than usual and i have a girlfriend 
I didn't come here for support nor help i came to give hope to those that dont have it work through what is hurting and become stronger because of it i believe that we all can become great things"	severe

train_pid_8267	"I have to go back on a higher dose and I hate admitting it : A couple months ago, I talked with my doctor about going on a lower dose of my antidepressant because it was affecting my memory and sleep (so we thought)

My wife and I made jokes that I was on such a high dosage, I was basically on horse tranquilizers.  

Two months ago, I went on a lower dose and everything was fine.  I just took less and didn't feel worse or better.  Maybe a little less sluggish and my memory was a bit better (I had troubles remembering some stuff).  

The last two months have been great except for the last couple weeks.  

It started with more worry.  I started thinking and stressing about is everything okay?  Is my relationship in a good place?  Is my wife happy?  Am I doing everything I can at work?  Why can't I do better in general?

I shrugged it off just being regular stresses and took this holiday season to just relax and enjoy.  It was going fine, but still I had nagging stresses and felt myself going into a bigger and bigger hole every time something not ideal happened.  I would be down for hours afterwards and I wasn't about to admit to myself or my wife that I wasn't doing well.   

I pushed so hard to be okay that a couple days ago, something very trivial happened where I took it to heart and a few days later, it was all I could think about when I was about to go to sleep, going to the movies, with friends or family.  

I've come to the conclusion that I need to go back up a little on my dosage like I was before.  My depression is back.  My doctor said if I started feeling it, I should go back up to the old dosage. (1/2 a pill instead of a 1/3)  

I feel like a failure.  My depression is still there and I can't beat it without medication.

My sleep is still the same on both dosages.  My memory will get worse possibly.  Maybe my methods I've built in remembering will help and I can not fall back into forgetting things.

But I'd rather be forgetful than frustrated, sad, angry, and overall unpleasant to be with the past couple weeks.  

I'm not suicidal at all, I'm not wanting to harm myself, I'm just sad and it's affecting my overall happiness in life and it's causing strain on my relationships.


I'm waiting for my wife to come home to talk to her about it and I know she's going to be supportive, but I'm in such a hole that I feel like she won't be.  I'm so in my head.  

Can I get some support?  

P.S.  If I do show my wife this, and now she's reading this, I'm sorry for the past couple weeks of shit.  I love you and my depression is no indicator how happy and in love I am with you.  You are my best friend and you didn't do anything wrong.  I know this is hard for you to fully understand, so, thank you for your love and support always :)"	severe
valid_pid_1709	"My First Reddit post: I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I am not able to pin point. Its this everlasting mopey feeling that just manages to ruin my whole day- every single day. : Hey all,
I am an international student studying film in the US. I recently graduated (in December) a semester before my class. I am on my OPT period under which I can stay in this country for 1 more year- if I get a job. 
I moved out of my roommates place in August 2019. I decided to live alone. Idk why I made that decision, but my life has been miserable since then. 
All the devilish thoughts, all my anger, self hatred, this disgusting LONELY feeling- all of these emotions that I had managed to suppress for 15 years, just started spewing out. 
For the first few days it was just in small batches- that I would feel horrible, but later it became every 3 days or 2 days kinda thing.
I’m gonna skip ahead in time and tell you how I feel now. I FEEL LIKE DOING NOTHING. 
I am a filmmaker, I used to love writing and making films. I don’t even know what I want to do anymore. I just sit around not being able to make a single successful decision in time. 
Not getting a job has really messed with my self image issues. I don’t like looking at myself sometimes. I feel very alone. I stay locked up in my apartment for the whole day. 
I smoke weed and that makes me calm down a little. But now, IDK if that’s even a thing or just me trying to PLACEBO my own self. I recently googled “Do I have Depression”.  
My phone seems to think I have depression, I need to get help. But I don’t know how. I don’t know if I have depression or is it just me trying to find a reason why I am not good enough to get a job anymore.

Woke up at 1 pm today but got over 12 hours of sleep, of course that makes me feel even more like shit. I have the most insane vivid dreams lately it gets really heard to wake up from them.
The house is not bad but it could be a lot better. I don’t have anything to say to anyone and I can’t bring myself to do the things I love. 
I guess I’m just looking for some words of encouragement or understanding. Always makes me feel a bit better knowing I’m not alone in this feeling. Sorry if this wasn’t very coherent thoughts, I have no energy to write out what I’m really thinking."	moderate
valid_pid_4323	"First Official Post : Well today I went for my first initial evaluation with a specialized psychiatrist since I was a kid (I'm 24). 
I mean I went to my University's student health and saw the psychiatrist there and got therapy through the psych service at school.
But this was my first seeing one not through a school. The kind with the leather couch and had classical music playing.
Anyway, I wasn't nervous like I said University blah blah blah. I went in confident just had to do the pre eval and just get my meds filled there. Well that's not what happened.
After an hour he sits back and I ask him how I'm looking. He said that he wanted to recommend inpatient. That was the first shock. (Idk why it was a shock I just never thought I needed it)
The second was after I told him about visual and auditory hallucinations (which I thought was normal because Uni doc didn't seemed phased). He told me he would right up a report but that I may have Psychotic Depression.
Now it may not seem like a big change from just having Major Depression Disorder, but idk.
Am I overreacting? Probably. I'm just tired now, I feel like everything that with depression would I'm just to lazy to type. I feel awful because my family cares and is supporting me and is doing everything they can. But I'm not fixed. I feel like I'm just a lost cause.
Sorry for bumming anyone out."	severe
train_pid_8785	"Therapy : I have been having some adverse reactions towards my therapist lately. In December we took a break from our relationship because we both had things to do. When I came back I was really anxious. I had never been so anxious seeing her. I thought that the anxiety would go away but it always come back. Whether I call to schedule an appointment with her, think about my appointment with her the night before my appointment, or while waiting for my appointment in the lobby, during our sessions and after my anxiety ramps up. My last session with her my voice was shaking. She told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. 
I don’t really know where this is coming from. I was expecting the anxiety to go away by now. I become so anxious that others notice at work and that I become nauseous. Maybe it’s the fear that the relationship could work out or maybe it’s the fear that it won’t work out. 
I kind of just use her as a sounding board at the moment. It bothers me to my core that I have to pay someone just to listen to me because I have been quiet for too long. The things that she tells me are basic.  We have tried meditation but I had this fear that she was going to rob me. We tried book work but we both became distracted and now we don’t know where to start with that. We practice assertiveness and I’m doing okay with that. Sometimes I don’t think that I need her and that I’m wasting my money. Sometimes I think it would be better if I just said that it isn’t working out."	severe

valid_pid_2547	"A Comprehensive Guide on Slowly Getting Better, and Not Losing Hope. : In no way am I an expert, and in no way have I mastered these points, but I have had depression for about 4 years now, and I have seen what works and what doesn’t, and I wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. Depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but I believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub.
I write this because it makes me feel better, and because I like to help other people. It makes me less depressed. If someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, I will be happy and grateful for it. Being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves.
In no way are these ordered from most important to least.
In no way am I suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self-hatred. I do not see hope for myself, but I believe in it regardless. I hope you can too.
**Exercise Daily -**
Do something you like. It doesn’t have to be the most intense, fat-burning, crazy workout. All I’m saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. Go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. Try out the gym for a couple months, aiming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. Try going and being active a couple times a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. It can be anything from karate to chess (trust me, this actually burns a significant amount of calories!), from swimming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a Shaolin Monk
**Eat Healthy -**
We always hear this one, and for good reason! It’s simple, but it gets hard, doesn’t it? We want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. I’m not saying pizza is off the table forever, but I’m saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. Try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! Contrary to popular belief, healthy food CAN taste good.
Many depressed people have low levels of Vitamin D (like me) so I take those regularly alongside some Magnesium supplements. I believe overtime this will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical imbalance a different way.
**Take Meds If You Need Them -**
Talk to someone. If they suggest pills, try them out. I have had pills that swung me the right way (Lexapro), and I have had pills that swung me a very, very bad way (some green looking pill, I don’t remember what it was but I hated it dude). Everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. Just… try it. I know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pills for depression and taking pills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. Not a cure, but a step.
**Journal -**
This is a big one for me. I have kept up journaling ever since I was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. Writing things down (like this) has a way of soothing the soul, I think. Write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. Write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. Write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy; hopefully at some point.
**Clean Your Room -**
I suck at this, but there’s something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. Put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. Get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. You’ll feel better, trust me.
**Read -**
This is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but I do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. No, not a book that you hope will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. Read Matilda for all I care! I read that book in one toilet session and I felt GREAT the rest of the day.
**Go Outside Once a Day -**
All I’m saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the “funk” it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something.
**General Hygiene -**
Big one. This is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. You’ll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. Take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, trim your beard, de-odor yourself, whatever! You’ll feel slightly better if you look and smell better.
**Sleep Well -**
I’m talking 8 hours at night and not throughout the day. Don’t waste the day away by taking little naps all the time. Do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. You will feel better. You won’t be cured, but you’ll feel better. Your body needs this, friend.
**Wake Up Early -**
Again, this might not be for everyone (as a matter of fact, who IS it for really), but trust me when I say that almost EVERY TIME I wake up early and do some stuff I like, the rest of the day feels better because I did something productive at the start of it. I get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it’s great!
**Be Wise With Money -**
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect a lot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction.
**Compliment People, Spread Positivity, Without Expecting Anything in Return -**
This is a great one. Even if you don’t believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. Everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. Here’s the catch: don’t do it for your own gain. Do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. You want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise.
**Don’t Stay in Your House or Room for Too Long (Poor timing on this one, I know. But go for a walk or something) -**
This comes at an awkward timing, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. My worst days are when I’m just scrolling Reddit or Pornhub or Facebook and when I’m just… wasting myself away. Get out of your room, be productive, do something.
**Serve Other People in Some Way -**
This is a bit different from complimenting people, but the premise is the same. Help others. Join a non-profit organization and help out once a week. You meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. There’s nothing like it! You are DOING something amazing, even if it is small. You are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. Do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. This could REALLY change your life, as it has mine.
**Get Together With Friends -**
Get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. Whether it's at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, ANYTHING. Just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. This may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago (and all of high school too), but try it out. The right people will come, I’m sure of it.
**Call Family -**
Whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. It has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, disconnection, abuse; anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. But sometimes you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other.
**Listen to Music -**
Duh! We all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. For me it’s Coldplay and a little known artist named Chris Renzema. They have been with me through ups and downs (lots of downs). I also listen to William Augusto Instrumentals as I fall asleep each night. Very helpful.
**Try Out Therapy for a Couple Months -**
It can be scary, I know. And for me personally therapy didn’t even fully work out for me. But this doesn’t mean I didn’t try it. I tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because I didn’t feel any differently. This won’t be the same for everyone. At least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend.
**Limit Screen Time if you Can Help it -**
Less time on the phone, less time on the computer, less time on the TV. All great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? Find a schedule that works for you. I personally am trying to lower my screentime on my phone to 5 hours a day, and eventually to 2 hours. Small goals, one step at a time.
**Make Daily To-Do Lists -**
Most days, in the morning or the day before, I create a to-do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. I even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what I accomplished and so I can put a little checkmark besides it!
**Take Care of a Pet -**
I recently got a Bearded Dragon (his name is Henry), and it has given me something new to live for and protect. As someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. Many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. Send me pictures of them so I can tell you how cute they are.
**Be In Nature -**
I believe this is for everyone. Get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. Try to travel to a National Park at some point, and take in the sights. Go for a short hike and look at the trees. We are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it.
**NoFap, NoPorn -**
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect alot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction.
**Practice Gratitude -**
Stay thankful for the things that you have. Whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. Just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. Again, I do this too, so let’s get better together.
*Now, I am a devout Protestant Christian, and I wanted to include my Christian side to this equation. This is the most important part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason I am still alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step.*
**Pray (For Others and Yourself) -**
**Read The Bible -**
This is the thing upon which we compare everything else. This is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the Lord speaks to His people through His Word. Learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the One who Loves us.
**Meditate -**
Christians meditate too! Take time in silence and align yourself with the Holy Spirit, as He speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth.
**Get Together with Church Community -**
**Listen to Worship -**
Take time alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in Jesus name, or are still depressed this side of eternity and are still trusting in the direction of the One who gave it all for them.

train_pid_5982	I feel ok for now. : It’s been a very long time that I’ve felt like I didn’t deserve nor want to be here. Just about everyday for 5-6 months negative thoughts made me want to just slit my wrists or drive into a tree or underpass. Just something to take myself out of this world or hurt myself because i feel like I deserve these types of things to happen to me. Today was the first day that I didn’t have nearly as many thoughts like that and I had more energy to do simple things like shower or go to the store. Im glad today was a better day than usual, but I’m just scared because I know when I feel any type of happiness or contentment, the next day or so things get worse than before and I get slammed back to the depths of depression. It’s just about to the point where I don’t want to be happy anymore because it’s just a trick. I get my hopes up in thinking I’m gonna be alright, but I know I’m just going to spiral and it’ll be worse than before.

train_pid_5611	After depression episode feeling : Don’t you feel that every time you suffer a depression episode and you manage to come back without killing yourself, still little by little something dies inside of you, hobbies, passions. After a 6 months depression episode I just don’t give a shit about school or work, I rather just sleep. I used to love designing know I kinda hate it, it causes me anxiety (architecture student).

I got to drive by a trio of friends later that wrote the same exam where I wasn’t invited which just reminded me that I barely even have friends. I had a really awkward encounter at the store that I couldn’t stop thinking about for the whole day. I’m sure I bored my girlfriend to death in the car driving in near silence to our date, and I hate myself for making her put up with me.
Did I forget my meds again? Or take them twice?
I don’t even know anymore.
All I know is I can’t do anything right."	not depression

valid_pid_2442	"I am struggling to help my depressed friend... I'm really trying but they constantly berate and lash out at me : I am at the end of my tether, so I would really appreciate some advice please.
A friend of mine - who I have known for nearly 20 years - had a bit of a bad turn in the past two years. He (34) is based in one country, and I (F, 34) currently live halfway across the world. He is what you would consider ""friends who are family"". Or least I thought so.
Lately, I am finding it very difficult to deal with him, and I feel that I should cut him out of my life.
**A summary of his situation:**
1. His marriage fell through a couple of years ago. His decision. He has one young child (bit of a mess, he broke up with her whilst she was pregnant, something I never agreed with). They were having problems for years; he claims she is the reason for many of his mental health issues.
2. Since then he has gone from not drinking - to drinking regularly. Sleeping around, making friends with weird people etc
3. It reached a stage where last year he was talking to me about suicide, and how he has planned his death several times. He talks about how no-one in his life is there for him (mum, dad, ex-wife, sister).
4. Now - he has fallen into trouble with the law, accused of something pretty serious. I have no doubt in my mind he is innocent (despite the changes of the past few years), so that's not even a question. Just to add context to his background, he is educated to doctorate level, intelligent and has a good job (he's currently suspended until police make a decision whether to charge him) and has never been in trouble with the law before.
**The issues I encounter:**
1. At the best of times, he is quite insensitive in the way he deals with people. He can be quite cutting with his words at times, and I feel in the past, he hasn't been there for me when I needed him the most (a couple of situations). That being said, he was married, in a different country...etc. so I kind of get it. People get busy with life.
2. Because of a childhood complex, he doesn't like people giving him advice. So even when you try to have a conversation with him, and offer some solutions, he lashes out about it and gets angry.
3. I have recommended therapy because I know how much it helps. He says he has been, but was never given any medication (he's not sure if he wants to take meds), and since the one time he went, he hasn't said anything else about it. TBH, I don't think he even went back.
4. More recently - with this ""trouble with the law"" situation... he would send messages like: ""I am going to be charged... I just know it. I am going to lose my child. I have no faith in the justice system. I cannot go to prison. If I am charged, that's it; I am ending my life.""
5. I personally feel he's not taking enough action. He's not speaking to many lawyers, for instance. He is with one lawyer who doesn't seem to be doing much. He comes across as being very indifferent about the whole process. He asks me what I would do if I am in his position. I tell him. His response? ""You don't think I haven't thought of that? You think I am just sitting there doing nothing? You think you're all high and mighty. I have never been in trouble with the law. I am so scared. I have no idea what to do or how anything works."" etc. I ask him if he trusts the lawyer he's with. He says: ""I don't know; how do I even figure that out?""
6. After his latest outburst, I told him to get his act together and enough with the victim mentality. In hindsight, my choice of words were not great - but there's only so much I can take. I attempted to explain to him that the concept of victim mentality also applies to genuine victims (I had spoke to this with my therapist before), I never once implied he was faking it, but in order for an individual to create change they have to leave the victim mentality and go into survival mode. To me, he is being defeatist right now when he needs to fight to clear his name. No-one in the world can do something like that for you but yourself. It's what I would do personally.
7. He responded by saying he thought I was a ""disgusting human being"" and an ""insensitive prick"". And for the past 24 hours has latched on the words ""victim mentality"" when I fully explained what my point was. He then proceeded to say ""No matter how many times I tell you, I have no idea what's going on. You're just assuming I am sat at home being defeatist."" Earlier, he made a reference about how I have always butted in about his life. The funny thing is... It has always been him coming to me with the problems. I even went through old emails today to make sure I am not going crazy.
**What do I do?**
I am tired. I feel I'm his emotional punchbag. Despite him calling me disgusting, I am trying to be there with support just for the sake of his child.
Every time he has gotten angry accusing me of having no idea what is going on, I have reminded him that I am not in his environment. I am not in the middle of it all, therefore I just go by what he is telling me from halfway across the world. Which is usually not much. He is the one who usually initiates conversation with messages like ""I know I am going to jail. I just know it."" I try my best to be there and listen, whilst trying to offer some hope.
I have offered financial support for legal fees. I have offered to talk to lawyers I know. I have offered friends who are connected to law. He hasn't taken any of my offers.
He complains about advice given to him. Then asks me what I would do if I were in his position. I answer, and then he gets angry at me. You know that feeling of that you cannot win, no matter what? I don't know what he wants, and I don't know how to help him.
I have had my own mental health issues, but it's in my personality is just to own it and do something about it. I made myself go to a psychiatrist; I took the medication; I made myself go to a therapist. I strongly believe that no-one in the world can help you but you - you need to be the one to take action to save your soul. Not everyone is the same, I understand that. But this is not helping my own mental health.
I have never wanted anything from my friendships, but it doesn't feel good to absorb this much negativity on a delay basis. It does affect me. His words can be immensely hurtful at times. I understand that this might be due to what he is going through, but there's only so much I can take before I am at breaking point.
I apologise for this being a long read, but I wanted to offer as much background as possible. I'm hoping I can connect with someone who could give me advice on what to do in this situation.
Thank you."	not depression

He had been clean for three years, and was so fucking proud of himself. We have no idea how long hes been using again, but when i was doing a sweep of his basement, i found a pipe, 2 needles (one loaded) and three baggies. I used to use, but ive been clean for 7 months now. I always thought if he could do it so could i. But thats not the point i guess. I told my sister she shouldnt worry about it, i kept an eye on him. I checked his arms and legs when he wasnt looking. I talked to him atleast once a week. Fuck i saw him earlier yesterday, and i couldnt fucking tell. I told her repeatedly that he wasnt using, cause i would be able to tell if he had been. I put it on everything that he wasnt using. I went to bat for him on a hundred different occasions. Hes the closest thing ive ever had to a brother, and because i was so sure of myself i told them not to worry about it. I shouldve been able to see the signs.	moderate

Crying has become my only solace in life. I love crying. It’s like a prayer to God and a way of hugging myself. It’s like my soul finally being able to breath and speak.
It’s all I have that comforts me. No one knows me or sees me or understands me for who I am. No one comprehends the pain I’ve gone through and continue to go through everyday. I help others all the time and show love and compassion.
Who will help or save me now?
People are so judgemental. Why can’t we just love one another and do what’s right and avoid what’s wrong? People are so proud they don’t see anyone who suffers and they treat others like dirt.
We are all Gods children right? Why can’t we have compassion for one another and stop abusing each other, mocking others and being cruel?

valid_pid_1036	"I’m at a crossroad... : I’m a 30 year old male. I’ve been suffering from anxiety and periodic panic attacks for 10 years. Although I seem like a happy genuine and likeable guy on the surface I have been fighting with anxiety and panic below the surface. Like a duck who seems to float peacefully on the surface on the water but is kicking below the surface of the water just to prevent itself from sinking.
6 months ago I decided to just stop resisting the panic and anxiety and just let is wash over me. I’m tired of fighting, there is no more energy left. For 10 years I’ve been trying to look at life from a bright perspective but I can’t do it anymore. 
Ever since that decision 6 months ago a feeling of depression crawling over me. For the past week these waves of depression and hopelessness came up so strong that I feel like I’m disassociating: I can only lie down and undergo the feeling, like I’m smothered by dread and terror.
For the past days or so I’ve been entertaining the thought of suicide. I don’t see a way out of this, and if this will be the quality of my life for the rest of my life I don’t feel like riding it out.
I still have 30 grams of cocaine (yeah... don’t ask me why...) which I’ve considered dissolving into a glass of water and drink all at once.

It's unseen, unheard, yet it's there like a dark veil covering you all the time.
I was in a very dark place.
My grandmother and grandfather passed away shortly after each other and then the girl I had been with for 5 years cheated on me and left me with an appartment I couldnt afford getting me into debt.  And then my aunt got cancer to make matters worse.
I barely had energy to get out of bed, let alone get up and go to work for a very shabby paycheck.
But I kept getting up, and went to work.
Stayed extra hours if I didnt make enough yet to pay my rent.
I was on autopilot like this for a long time, just barely going by my day to day life.
Social contact was getting less and less too.
I didnt reach out and eventually people stopped reaching out too.
I started smoking weed and started drinking a lot.
Gained a lot of weight because of it and an unhealthy diet of fastfood, but didnt care.
All the things I liked doing before, gaming, football, chilling with friends, became boring. Everything was boring.
I often had thoughts of just ending it, but didnt wanna do that to my mom who always tried to help.
So I just kept going like I was.
Then one day I just decided I had enough, yes the going had been rough, but I wouldnt let it get me down.
I started working out and getting in touch with friends I had lost contact with.
And started looking for a job that had a better pay to get out of my debts.
I found that job through a friend I reached out to again and got out of my debts.
Now I still have some dark days, but they are far less common then before.
And I feel like it's all getting a bit better slowly, but surely.
I understand this wont help everyone, and not everyone can just flip a switch one day and say enough is enough, it's not that easy, all I am saying is do not give up. That change could come someday.
It could be something inside yourself, or maybe something you witness happen.
A song, a movie, anything.
Just dont give up.
One day it might get better.

valid_pid_4152	":) : idk if i have depression, tbh. all i know is i am worthless, useless, stupid, fat, and unpredictable. i think this all started when i just shower everyone with trust and love.
let me tell you something about myself. i was jolly, quirky, playful, and silly when i was a kid. i am friends with everybody in the class.
back to the story..
i met my childhood ""ex best friend"" back in 4th grade. were so close that no one could ever separate us. you'd see us having lunches together, have tutoring sessions together, playing together, and everything that normal child besties do. but everything changed when we met our 3rd best friend. they started to hang out much more, leaving me behind but i didn't mind cus hey, i'm glad that we have more friends to do everything with. all went well until 6th grade. my ""ex best friend"" started to get distant; like she would always try to avoid talking to me, having eye contact, or even sitting next to me. i got really sad that time. what did i do to make her avoid me? and that lasted for months. time passes by and graduation was approaching. we had a little kick-off party for the whole class. i was a bit hesitant on attending the party bc i was just not in the mood for anything but i went anyways. not bc the teacher said everyone should go but bc my mom told me to spend the last day of school with my ""friends"". so i did. and that wasn't pleasing at all. when i arrived in school my other friends immediately asked me if i was going to my ""(ex) best friend's"" pool party the day after graduation. of course i didn't know about this so-called pool party my best friend will held for her ""friends"". so they were shocked as i am. one friend stood up and told me something about me and my best friend's 3rd best friend from 4th grade. she told me that she's been bad mouthing me from the very beginning. j just fell totally silent at that moment ad my world began crumbling into pieces. 
fast forward, graduation was over and time for high school. i was still down the whole summer and i wanted to get away from people i knew bc i would think that they were all gossiping fallacies about me. so i decided, no. i want to go to a new school for a change of environment. but it was not what i expected to be. i had a hard time making new friends and with a span of 3 days, i quitted that school. then my mom moved me to a high school in our town where all of my elementary classmates were. luckily, they were based on the science oriented classes. and i was enrolled to an arts based curriculum. everyone was nice to me and i started to gain confidence again. until a group of friends bullied me for years. so i found refuge in food. i began to eat a lot when i get sad, or happy. all was fine until i gained weight and my body wasn't pleasing to look at anymore. and guess what, those bullies started to pick on my body a lot more. they'd be shouting ""walk faster, fatso. you're blocking our way"" and shits like that. so, i started to eat less thinking that if i'd be skinnier, everyone would like me. years went by and i did lost a couple of pounds. i found myself happy again. 
now, during my teenage years, my father would always have something to say to every action i make. idk why but i just thought maybe he's just tired from work. so i let it slide. 
but on december 2019, my crumpled up world burned into ashes. 
my father and i were sitting on the bench in the mall, waiting for mom to finish in the public restroom. he was complaining to me about the agency he was working at, so i just listened and told him that it's going to be fine. but then he uttered, ""i wish i hadn't build this family too early."" 
that made me stopped listening to him and those words kept repeating inside my head. so he regretted having us? having me? or this family? like wth? we were a mistake? is that why he's always hot-headed with me? 
shit happened and i couldn't take everything they were throwing at me. the pain was unbearable to the point where i would shiver every night while crying. sometimes, i'd just contemplate whether to take my own life or not. but then i thought of my mother. i wanted to give her a better life and make her smile more. i don't want to leave her first because that would crush her. so what i do is sometimes, i'd just grab the nearest sharpest object and cut my wrists. it was painful but it was good. it is so addicting that everytime the pain was too extreme i'd do it again and again and again and again until i can feel the pain on my wrists, not the one in my chest."	severe

valid_pid_3356	How to deal with feeling alone? I have zero friends, and have never been in a relationship. I don’t belong anywhere. : I’ve never been in a relationship and I’m already 23 years old. My brain just keeps telling myself that no one is going to like me I’m too quiet, I’m a homebody, I’m not adventurous, I don’t have any friends so I’m a loner. I just feel like there’s nothing special enough about me for someone to choose me or want to be with me more than anyone else. I’m a nice person that listens, that’s about all I have going for me. I want to meet people, but no matter what I do I feel like I don’t belong, I’m not enough of anything to belong to certain “groups” of people I’m always an outsider. I so badly want to meet other people, so I will feel less alone. I unfortunately isolated myself socially for the past 6 years because of social anxiety and it has made it so I have no clue how to even have friends. Can anyone relate? Am I alone?	not depression
train_pid_3488	Current students/working adults, how do you cope with your responsibilities while depressed? : I'm a university student hanging on to my last strand of motivation to study - which is the anxiety of performing badly and getting expelled. I've lost interest in my course. I used to be fairly interested in it but now it seems like I don't care anymore and every lesson is just another burden. How do you get over such thoughts and force yourself to study/work when you're depressed? My anxiety of the school semester starting pretty soon is killing me, yet it's ironic how I can't get myself to start studying proper.	moderate

valid_pid_1772	"Today has been one of my worst lows in a long while : I see a therapist every other week, and I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me anti depressants. I've been working on my self esteem, self worth, depression, and all sorts of issues over the past 2 years. But every once in a while I just get a wave of depression that hits me hard.
Today I feel like complete shit. I'm tired as hell, nothing brings me joy, and I can't stop thinking about my ex. I have absolutely no one I can talk to in my life about some of the stuff that bothers me. I had one friend that basically stopped talking to me without telling me why. 
I hate seeing the whole world live happier lives than I do. I don't hate the world, I hate myself for not having the strength to put myself out there and do something with my life. I don't hate other people for being in happy relationships, I hate myself for being so goddamn cowardly and too afraid to talk to women. I just feel fucking hopeless."	moderate
train_pid_5488	"I'm a mess right now : I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 
Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.
I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.
I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.
Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.
I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.
There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.
The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.
Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.
I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.
I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.
Wow, this ended up really long."	moderate
valid_pid_520	"Easier to lie : I'm exhausted from telling the truth. Telling what I really feel and what I'm going through. How difficult it is. How lonely it is sometime. I keep telling myself that sharing to those who I trust is a good thing -- but it's not. 
All those words, promises, from others are just lies. They'll forget their own words and will just hurt you again and again. I know everyone is tired. I know everyone is stressed. How is it that I can't feel tired when everyone can?
I didn't ask for this kind of mental state. I didn't want to be in this mental state. I guess it's easier to lie saying ""I'm fine,"" or making myself look ""happy."" It's easier to fake your happiness than to be truthful of what pains you.

I'm 20 years old, had to drop out of college after one year because I'm too poor, have been working an extremely dead-end job for the past six months and just don't know what to fucking do anymore.
I went to college for one year but had to drop out because I couldn't afford it. I have zero friends, and my job is overnights for 10 hours, four days on four days off and only pays minimum wage. I'm male and I work with five ladies who are all each over 40 so there's zero fucking connection between them and me. I don't have a car yet so I'm still stuck at this job for at least another couple of months until I can get one because I'm getting carpooled right now. My only friend moved to Mississippi a few years back and we've been growing more distant and hardly have anything in common anymore. When I'm not at work the only thing I want to do is sleep and I get very little enjoyment out of activities that I used to love, and on days I don't work it's hard to force myself to do anything. My parents are poor so they can't afford to put me on their health insurance and I can't afford it myself. 
The one thing I had to look forward to was a vacation to Portland that I've been planning for over six months, but now due to all this Coronavirus bullshit I have to reschedule. I can reschedule my plane tickets but my AirBnB was booked outside of the refund date so there's $300 down the fucking drain.

valid_pid_1166	"I feel like there’s no point in being alive anymore. : I’m so bored and tired all the time. I work nightshift which definitely doesn’t help my depression. I literally work, eat, and sleep. I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. 
I have a boyfriend who I love, but we have a turbulent relationship. Partly due to my depression and other mental illnesses, and him being unable or unwilling to understand. For example, I’m literally never horny and am repulsed by my body, and I try to tell him that, but it always ends with him being angry at me and turning it around saying “you don’t make me feel wanted. I’m sorry I can’t turn you on.” I’ve tried so hard to make him understand, but he doesn’t. While we were fighting over this (and the fact that I had burned myself and was talking about how I don’t want to live anymore), he told me “You’re just too broken.”
Today my dog bit his friend in the face. (My dog is friendly to literally everyone except this one man, who KNEW my dog didn’t like him, but he decided to get in his face anyway and got bit.) He started yelling and saying he’d throw my dog against the wall, punch my dog, kill my dog. I was in shock and didn’t really apologize well due to the fact I was angry he was talking about killing the only thing in life that has kept me living this far. Now the guy has filed a police report, and if he ends up going to the doctor for it, I’ll have to pay his medical bills. Thank god he’s not pressing charges, but yeah. My boyfriend is on his side, saying there must be something wrong with my dog. I kept saying “What kind of friend is that?” And he told me he’d do the same thing. He said if the roles were reversed and he got bit he’d beat the fuck out of the dog too. I told him I’ll fix this by never coming over to his apartment with my dog again. He’s going to continue being friends with the guy.
My friends don’t ever talk to me. We’ve been friends since high school. I understand we’re doing our own things now, trying to grow up. There was a period of time last year my mental health was so bad I could barely leave the house. I had isolated myself and deleted all social media. No one asked me what was wrong. They would just get mad when I said I didn’t want to go out. I ended up apologizing to them for sinking down into my depression hole, which was met with them telling me “yeah, I was pissed at you, but I know how you are” and forgiveness. Does me being depressed need to be forgiven? 
I have no motivation to do anything. Everything bores me. I’ll start a tv show and drift off thinking or playing on my phone or changing the show. I can’t keep interest in any hobbies. I’ll start a project and 5 days later I won’t care about it anymore. 
I hadn’t cut myself in a year. I quit taking my birth control and all hell broke loose in my mind. I didn’t cut, but I held a knife over a lighter and then burned myself. Just to feel something. Just to focus on anything. 
I really feel like life isn’t worth living. Nothing in my life is fun. I don’t even have the motivation or want to do anything fun. I just want to sleep and smoke and hate my life. I only have $1000 to my name, no savings. I have a car and a place to live rent free, so I’m blessed in that aspect. But is it a blessing if I don’t even want to live? Why do I deserve this? There are so many people who deserve this, and I don’t. I deserve to fucking rot in the dirt. 
I’ve been thinking about taking my $1000 and just driving across the country with my dog. It’s not a feasible idea, but it’s where my mind likes to escape to when I’m not down enough to think about suicide. I guess I think that on my little journey I’ll find something worth living for. I always try to run when things get hard. But by then I’ll have lost my job and run out of money. 
I get like this so often, but recently it just feels like shit keeps happening to me. I keep getting shit on over and over. I’m stuck at $1000, and can’t seem to get more than that without something happening and me having to pay. I’ve been planning on going back to school, but I’m not excited. I know I’m just going to fail like I have before. I’ll get all these classes and be so ready to learn, and then a month in I’ll say “what’s the point” and flunk out half of them.

train_pid_4915	Reflecting but not in a good way : My bf of 1.5 years has brought up once again how I was a “hoe” before we were together. For some context, we were in high school. My father had passed away my freshman year and I was looking for attention, and I was sexually assaulted right before my junior year and kind of went crazy (my theory is that I was trying to reclaim myself but really I just slept around a lot). We started dating right before senior year and now we’re in college. I of course feel like absolute shit about all of this. I wish I could take it all back, but I can’t. I tried to kill my self after I was raped, and at times like this I wish I would have succeeded. Maybe I deserved to get raped because I was being a hoe. God I just feel so horrible and I wish I could do something about it but I can’t express that to him because I don’t want him to think I’m pulling the suicide card to make him feel bad. Bringing that shit up genuinely puts me in this weird mindset and mood for a few days. I remember back when I was so depressed that I have a lot of lost memories and things that I repressed. I remember how I felt when I smoked weed every single day because it was easier to dissociate than to kill myself. I don’t know what to do. He’s a great guy he just makes me feel like shit when he brings this up. I feel like I regress back to my 16-17 year old self when this happens.	moderate
train_pid_6638	"Empty : I wanted to have friends. People to share experiences with. People to make the world feel smaller. I made it through high school and college thinking that I had friends. I didn't realize that I was the one always reaching out to them. I didn't see that I was changing my habits and opinions with the hope of fitting in. 

Not only am I friendless, but everyone else seems so well-connected. Everyone goes to each other's weddings and hangs out together. So many dating, married, starting families. I don't have any of that, not for a lack of trying. I feel empty."	not depression
train_pid_8595	"I think this is my final straw and I am scared : Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.
I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.
I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.
I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.
I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.
When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)
This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.
Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 
Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 
I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.
I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 
The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 
About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.
I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 
We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 
I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.
It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.
So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 
The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 
Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 
I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this."	severe

train_pid_3390	"I’m so empty : I wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. 


I’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. 

I don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore 

Depression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.


Not quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don’t want to live like this anymore. Any advice is appreciated"	moderate
valid_pid_2059	"It's so hard to ""reach out"" : I've been on and off severely depressed since the fall. I work really hard to manage it and am seeing a new therapist this coming week but the ""working hard to manage"" part is so exhausting sometimes or maybe all the time idk. 
I know isolating myself is not healthy to the point of it being dangerous but it's just so hard to deal with other people. People I'm not open about my situation with are exhausting and/or irritating to be around. I get so drained by just an hr or two of socializing and a lot of things I would normally love are just out of the question. (which makes me sad about being depressed) 
I'm also having a hard time with the people that do know what's going on to some extent. I hate dealing with their reactions, even the kind ones. People ask what they can do to help and I just don't have anything to tell them. I wish I did because I know they want to help. I keep canceling and not following up on tentative plans because I just sit around and cry. I dont want anyone to see me like that. Or im anxious and can't properly make decisions about anything. I think an unanswered text means someone hates me etc and then I'm so out of sorts I can't handle hanging out when they do answer.
I've been friends with people who get severely depressed and while l love and care for them i know first hand how hard it can be to be around them. I feel so guilty that I am now that person to others. I don't want to harm people with how unhappy i am but I'm afraid i am which makes me isolate more and I see how this is a negative reinforcing loop. 
So how do you deal with other people? Do you have things you ask them to do for you because it will at least make them feel better? How do you respond to, ""is there anything I can do?"" How do you deal with not wanting to be a burden but also not completely isolating yourself?"	moderate

Which tbh shocked me cause no one ever talk to me about the situation but I have a strong memory with it. Whole ordeal was violent. So it just stuck I guess. I feel guilty for even feeling bad about it. 
I was beaten and my dad at the time I think he sexually abused me. 
I was adopted. 
I was hell to raise. No one understood why such small things would send me on a rampage. I feel so bad to anyone who was my friend. I was possessive. I was so toxic. I just didnt want to be lonely. I'm sorry. 
I was bullied all through elementary to middle school. 
I had social anxiety it physical hurt my face felt like a thousand needles poking it and like someone lit me on fire.AND on my grAndmother theres no Exaggeration there. And through high school I never learned how to love myself after all those years of bullying. I craving for love and willing to do anything for it. I have such unreasonable violent mood swings though it makes me feel so ugly. But I'm still clingy as ever. Tbh I think I want to get admitted to a hospital for a month atleast. I'm not stable and also having delusional ideas. Getting graphic here. But I'm struggle so hard right now my emotions have full control. I'm suffocating.

train_pid_6624	"depressed ex sending weird signals : So after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after I ghosted her boring message,  I texted my ex telling her I cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. She replied with a “yeah well you too” I didn’t reply. Later in the day she sent me a Snapchat telling me she was drunk (New Years eve) nothing else interesting though. I was like yay have fun, and we didn’t talk the rest of the night (she’s in Europe rn I’m in the states). I didn’t send her a happy New Years or anything when it turned midnight here. In the morning I woke up to a “happy New Years, and all the best for you! 🥰” i replied with a “thanks and you too”. No other text communication although I replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. 

I’m confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said couldn’t feel anything, and later said she couldn’t love me or anyone else right now. I find it kind of weird she’d include the lovey emoji, she doesn’t use them much and it’s just something I feel an ex wouldn’t send to someone they broke up with. She’s also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad I ghosted her (understandable) and has never been the type to double text or contact first.

A career, a degree, true love, *something.* Instead, I'm in the same place I was back then, except my youth is officially over. I'm turning 30 this year. Everyone my age is settling down and staying inside. Soon, my body will give out on me too. I used to be a fat kid, but I've gotten a lot more active in the past couple years. What's the point if I'm just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? I'm finally serious about going to college, but the only way I can afford it is if I abuse the shit out of myself. I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.)

valid_pid_2752	"Depressed girlfriend wants to isolate herself : Hi, I have no idea if this is the right sub but I really hope so.
**Some background info**: I'm 1,5 year into a long distance relationship with my girlfriend. We're both in our early to mid 20s. I most likely won't be able to see her again for a few months because of the corona virus. 
She lives in a toxic home and has both depression and an eating disorder. She's had it for the whole time during our relationship, but the three past months it has progressively gotten worse to the point were she's now suicidal everyday. I do my best to support her but I know I make mistakes sometimes.
**The problem:** Two days or so ago she begged me to please let her isolate herself for a few weeks or so. She said she wanted to just be alone and think. I was a little hesitant and asked questions but wanted to respect her wishes. A few hours later she came home from finally visiting a mental health professional again, and she admitted something to me: The isolation was a plan to make people ""stop loving her"" (her words) so that she could kill herself easier in a month or so. *She then begged me to don't let her kill herself and don't let her isolate even if she says she wants to. She suggested that I could call her and talk ot her instead if she ever wants to isolate again.*
Yesterday which was about 2 days later, she said she wanted to isolate again. She made a video where she explained her reasoning behind it. She said that she's too sad to talk to anyone right now and that she wants to just think about what she has, what she is and ""start a journey"" with herself. Something like that, I don't know how to summarize it. But well, she's begging me to please let her do this if she I love her. She said ""I promise to not to anything"" and ""we will meet in two months if the corona situation has gotten better, and we will travel together"". She also said that she will text me good morning and good night every day so that I know she's there, and that I can send her texts and pictures but shouldn't expect her to do the same or even answer. She said that she want to do this for a few week or even MONThS.  
If the circumstances were different I would just respect her wishes without questioning them. But I'm really scared that this is just another plan to kill herself. Even if it isn't, I worry that her being almost totally isolated with just her toxic family will make her depression worse. And oh, her country is quarantined so she won't go to work or see any friends at all for at least 2 weeks. 
I'm really worried about her. She's saying ""I'm gonna isolate now, bye. Talk to you soon again"" and things like that. She seems really determined but I don't know if I should let this happen because of what she said 2 days ago. And now she just texted me ""please pray that nothing will happen to me"". Wtf this is giving me so much anxiety. I don't know what to do, I don't want her to kill herself."	not depression

I've been going through a bad time these past couple of months with my depression hitting a new low now for the holidays. My fiancé tried to be helpful at first. He would always tell me to just take it day by day and that we'd figure it out together. He'd tell me to lean on him when I need to, to talk to him or yell and rant and rave at him if it would make me feel better and he'd ride it out with me. Well, I took him up on that offer for once, choosing to open up rather than bottle it up and ""deal with it"" myself like I usually do. Now, all we've done is fight these past couple weeks, and I'm so fed up with it. I've been going through a lot of stuff lately, I've been open and honest and vocal about my mental illness, but he takes my illness too personally and I don't know what to do. Yes, I haven't been as cuddly or kissable and I've been irritable these past couple weeks, but come on, I warned him about this, told him don't extend an offer to ""help"" if you're just going to spin it on how horrible of a girlfriend I am. I told him I didn't want to open up in this way because I knew he was going to take everything personally and end up making me feel even worse. Every gd day he looks for a way to low blow me about how I don't love him or care about him because I'm so grumpy and all I want to do is fight. No, I just want you to stop being such a d***head and stop kicking me when I'm already down. I can't get him to understand that not everything is about him. I know what I need to feel better and that's just time and patience to recover and find myself again and quite frankly I don't have the energy to try and kiss up to my fiancé. I barely have enough to get myself out of bed most days and now I have my whole life for 5 years crumbling in front of me and I just don't even know what to do anymore.

train_pid_4849	"New Years : Okay so for a couple years now I've been feeling depressed, and a year ago maybe, I told my mum I wanted some help (e.g. therapy, doctor), yet she said no because it would show up ""on my record"" and would look bad (I guess for jobs but idk why they would need to know that). Anyway, this year it was particularly bad especially round xmas, cause of a number if things: our family like fully fell apart so we have no more contact with my grandparents, cousins etc., I don't really want to say anything specific due to privacy things but a close family member ended up in hospital from the 24th (xmas eve) to the 27th, and on top of that my mum brought her boyfriend over for xmas, who I don't like and they've only known each other for like 2 months anyway. So after all of this I go out with some friends for new years and this is where it gets bad. I usually drink and I'm fine with it but for new years I think just cause I was really down I just drank a shit ton and blacked out, so my friends had to take care of me. That's one thing is that they had to take care of me which I feel bad about cause I genuinely ruined their night, but on top of that after one person sent me the videos I just saw myself saying stuff that was super out of hand in that I was just unloading all of my emotions and talking about how I hated life etc. So now I feel like shit cause I feel like I was such an asshole by drinking that much and making it so unpleasant for everyone else. But now I'm thinking more about what happened and after talking to my mates some more I think the best way forward is to get some help, yet I know that when I ask my mum she will say no. The other thing is I may be able to get help without parents involved, I don't know how that all works. Anyway that's what I wanted to get out, I just want some help, thanks"	moderate

valid_pid_4444	"I lost a friend to suicide : Hey, friends. 
I wanted to share this in hopes that it helps just one person or puts things into perspective. 
Two weeks ago I found out my friend passed away. He took his own life. I worked with him for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and him and I would go out by ourselves once a month or so. We weren’t super close, but we were good friends. When he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. 
Three weeks before he died, I called him up and asked for a huge favor. He lived within a mile of me and I needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted him to show me how. He had plans that night but said they could wait and he’d be over within an hour. When he arrived, I asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. I asked if everything was okay and he said “not really, but that’s life!” He helped me change the tire, I gave him a hug and told him we should get drinks soon. Him and I had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so I wanted to be there for him. 
I didn’t reach out soon enough. When I heard the news I was in shock. I was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. When I drove home that night I cried. I took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that him and I would go to. I had to pull over because I was crying so hard. I was sobbing and screaming “it would’ve been okay, I promise you. Everything would’ve been okay.” As if he could hear me. The next day, I had to leave work because I couldn’t stop crying. I took the day after that off. I couldn’t think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. Whenever I was outside I would think that everything just felt different. The world feels different and empty without him in it. 
You always think about how sad your parents will be, your best friends, your SO. He wasn’t my best friend, we saw each other once every 4 or 5 months. Even ex-coworkers who hadn’t seen him in a year are grieving massively. My coworkers and I arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and I witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. 10 of us who worked with him showed up, one drove 5 hours to be there. The others opted out because they were still struggling so much (they will be attending the official memorial). My point is, death reaches so much further than you think it will. 
I’ve been there, and I know that when you’re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life will be better off without you. I’ve also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. I also recognize that everyone has different struggles and I’m not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. But experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to him were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. 
Anyways, this was way longer than I expected. Reach out to your friends and tell them you love them and are there for them, if you’re in a place mentally where you are able to do so. And feel free to reach out to me personally if you are struggling."	severe

It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go.

valid_pid_1112	"Depression: my thoughts and experiences : DEPRESSION IS HARD TO DEAL WITH!!
Trust me I know. I want to try and sum up in a few paragraphs what depression means to me and how I’ve learned to deal with it and understand it. 
If the cause of our depression is out of our control, we have to try and acknowledge the fact that life will throw us curve balls, takes the wind out our sails and pull the rug from under our feet when we least expect it. It’s not about what happens to us it’s about how we deal with it that matters.
My depression has been caused not by uncontrollable life events, but by my own stupidity, my own poor decisions, my own silly behaviour, my own horrific mistakes. My sadness was caused by nothing but myself. This is a much more bitter pill to swallow but can still be fixed over time. 
However our depression came about, it is our brain that is overwhelmed by negative thoughts. Be it anger or self hate, suicide or self harm, past distresses or consequences. Negative thoughts are playing on a loop in our brain, the longer we allow the negative thoughts to continue the harder it will be to emerge from our depression. 
I know, trying to tell a person with depression to think positively sounds like a load of bullshit right? But introducing positivity is the only thing that will work. We have to try and see a positive way forward, where we exercise and eat nutritious food. Where we hang out and laugh with friends. Where we start to love and care for the people around us or picture ourselves with a new partner and finally move on from that emotional break up. 
For me, when I’m at my lowest I would lose my appetite and wouldn’t go to the gym. I would lose muscle mass and start to look skinny. When I did eat it was just junk food to make the hunger go away. My sleeping pattern was lost and I had dark circles under my eyes. I stopped cleaning my house and allowed it to get messy and unhygienic. I stopped seeing friends and family and cancelled plans because I looked horrific. My job suffered and my finances took a hit. 
No matter how bad things appear we should try to remain positive in the important areas of our life. Depression will come and go but our health and hygiene can deteriorate quick when we don’t look after ourselves. Building up from rock bottom each time is difficult, try to avoid hitting rock bottom by staying positive enough to look after ourselves well. 
Laying in a dark room and obsessing over events that happened last week, last month or last year will get us nowhere, a nutritious meal and phone call to a friend will get us somewhere. Allow positivity in and slowly our depression will ease. 
Thanks for reading."	moderate

My first big failure I was only 5. My neighbor was a girl who quickly became my best friend because of proximity, we were the only two houses in the area the rest were cheap motels. So we would hang out pretty much daily and play games mostly ones emulating TV characters which usually put me in a hero and her in a damsel in distress situation. Well the whole time we were friends she was regularly being raped by one of her dad's friends, as were her siblings. So great hero work there. After a few years our houses were both torn down to build a supermarket, I didn't see her again til high school and she could barely stand to ever look at me.   
My mom was an alcoholic, manic depressive, had a rare genetic disorder and plenty of other problems.

I joined the Coast Guard because I wanted to finally be able to help someone. Six years I didn't do anything to help anyone except my superiors in the Coast Guard. No lives were saved by anything I worked on or was a part of in six years. Not even by proxy, my entire unit didn't do shit to help anyone, it was a combat-focused unit.
Now the closest thing I have to a social life is posting on reddit. Giving advice to people, sometimes ones who didn't ask it. Advice that is probably useless because it is coming from me, someone who is a mentally ill failure that's barely ever been able to function in society. The fuck do I know? I don't even leave the house.

Its been 2 months, and I just gave up on a hobby that only made me more anxious. If I can't work I can't help my family, I can't pay back my debt, I can't help anyone.

But now I am being kicked out the rest of the semester and my life seems to have fallen apart. I just feel so lost and angry. I do not even remember the last time I felt so awful.

I've had trouble with feelings of depression since I was in middle school, but have generally been able to function. I would slip on a mask of the guy everyone expected and just force myself through the motions. I've gotten pretty good at faking most emotional responses, appearing happy and engaged when I was absolutely dispassionate about situations that I ""should enjoy"" like being out with friends or going to concerts. This wasn't a fix for my mental state, and I knew that it was just bottling it up, but the few times I tried to talk either to parents or teachers about it I was told to just deal with it, man up, or some other shitty line.
I'm in my mid 20s now, and I've just been having a harder and harder time keeping going. I've started to have some suicidal inclinations, enough so that I left my gun at my father's house. I'm enjoying my hobbies less and less, and even spending time with my girlfriend has become difficult. 
I don't really know what I'm looking for, or how i expect this to help me in any way. I just felt like maybe saying this stuff in some form, even on the internet, might help me keep from feeling so damn bottled up and empty.

I got back into my career and things seemed possible for a while, then I was evicted due landlord selling up, unexpectedly dragged into my father's death by my extended family and fired by email from a hostile new job, when I was off sick with stress. 
That knocked me over again and pretty much killed off any remaining trust in people.
Even my cousin is uncaring, very well-paid job, fancy Audi and I never hear from her.
After a few more years of therapy, I was offered jobs again, I chose one that required relocating. Lodged with someone for a few months who was super controlling and I've ended up in a run-down houseshare I'm contracted in until July. I don't sleep well
The new job sucks, I'm surrounded by selfish, dysfunctional people working for a government agency.

and i recently got an email from my college that they'll be going to online classes for the rest of the semester. wonderful, i get to stay home even longer and feel the scraps of motivation and life i had before continue to slip away even further.
my identity and purpose is just slipping away like a second skin. i already had a shaky sense of self to begin with thanks to my dissociation issues but this is just, adding insult to injury. i feel like im going to go to bed one day and im going to wake up to realize nothing was real to begin with, that everything was fake. doesnt help that i already feel unreal pretty much all of the days now.
there is nothing to do. well, there is, but nothing i care about anymore. i used to like writing and drawing and creating but now its just empty empty and pointless. classic depression am i right? sure, the meds have been working but my environment still has impact and this is just making things worse. feeling trapped and held up like im some fish won at a carnival game by a kid whos gonna let me die in a few days due to shitty care.
my friends. can i even call them that anymore? they seem like strangers and feel like them too. i try to talk to them and i feel like they dont really care or are bothering to spend as much time as i put into them to even comfort me. its always about them really. like i want to disappear. guess my lifetime warranty is wearing out. guess the only thing left to do is completely disappear, something like that.
its not active suicidal ideation but fizzling and fading away might as well be the best option here to save myself from wasting more time on things i dont care about. a sort of mercy kill. they take take and take and never give back until they realize its too late and should have given more so they could keep taking from me down the line."	not depression

I ended my last relationship because i couldnt feel as strongly about her as i wanted. Looking back she was awesome in so many ways, and i realize how dumb i was. I look for stimulation in as many things as i can, im glued to my phone, i love video games, and it drove a wedge between us because i need something to stimulate me or i feel so bored...  i feel like i am not usually sad but just apathetic. Lately ive been in a much more hopeless depression because of the fact that i know i have no control over how much things mean to me and it makes me spiral downward because i want to care about things like others do.  Im not great at explaining it, and ive considered suicide because of how hopeless i am.  I know that i wont do it but it is tempting because of how little everything seems to matter.

My origin of bullying dates back to 2009 where I'm graduating from preparatory trust until when the awarding came, I cried because of not awarding a medal. This was the main starting point before after years of being bullied.
I won't detail too much on my Elementary days because it's too sensitive to talk about.
There is a stereotype Filipino boys must follow, ""boys don't cry, they must be strictly tough""
That stereotype influenced all boys because father's are reminding to their son's. From grades 1 to 4 I had been bullying non stop almost every day. By grade 5 it went calm but not too much but when grade 6 came, this would trigger the foundation of my depression. With the last week of my Elementary days, they bullied me nonstop unlimited because of my attitude background from prep to grade 5. They bullied me all day. It was so heavy, no one cared except my friends and family.
I have been guidanced since grade 3 to 6 because of this issue.
As I approach High School, I was expecting the same, and it did
By grade 8 in March 1 it was announced that the school will be renovated and I didn't cried not a single tear because my school didn't treated about bullying.
Within grade 9 was a new life because I studied at a Christian School and I've met one of my classmates form prep. I'll hide the name Champaine. I've met her in Roosevelt College Cubao as a prep. student. However there is one student who came from public school last year. He was treating me like ""hidden bullying"". In overall I had a great experience from this Christian School and continued here for grade 10.
By grade 10 I'm expecting one bully but it went multiple. There are 4 of them, 3 boys and 1 girl but I won't name them because of my personal reasons. These 4 were I hated the most but afraid to report because it has been repeated in my elem days. Also in this timeline, I had a crush on the one I've been her classmate last year. However I did something I didn't know it was illegal. On March 7, I've photographed her without asking her permission. They've caught the evidence I've did but I had nothing to do. That was on March 9, when they're scattering it.
Within that date, I had lost interest on her and I've promised to myself that ""I'm not gonna flirt another girl""
After I went home by 4 p.m. and waited until 8 p.m. I cried while mt little brother was sleeping because I think myself as a failure to this world. I'm trash, useless, worthless. I wanted to suicide so much I've handled my scars since I've been bullied. It was too much pressure to handle like I hope one day ""I'll die just one day to see who does care about me""
This is why untill now am I glitched or cursed?
Despite I didn't went to a specialist in mental health there was a treatment I've found, Coldplay
I've been following Coldplay since grade 9 and their music relates me wether I'm happy or sad and I encourage you to listen some of their music like Fix You, Everyday Life, A Sky Full Of Stars, Yellow, Viva La Vida, Up and Up, Paradise and so much more.
I hope you've read it and if you're posting it on FB, IG, Twitter, YT or any other social media sites pls. feel free to notify me.
As Chris Martin said: ""Believe in Love""
Thank you for reading this post and hoping for you to visit The Philippines. Just remember: ""Believe in Love"""	not depression

Soooo, I took a difficult course that was advised by several peers not to take because it is challenging. There is a project given two weeks ago and it is due in an hour and I tried to start it since 4 AM today and I couldn’t figure it out. Had a hard time remembering the simplest math rules, too (which I’ve been using for 4+ years). And now I’m just waiting it out. Also, this week has been terrible im general.
So, depression is making me feel stupid and very slow but at this point I don’t even know where depression started and where it ends. I don’t know if I’m just a lazy POS or it’s the chemicals in my head. The thing is, I’m not even stressed about it and I know I should be. No adrenaline kicked in and I just want to sleep."	moderate

I want to cry, I need to cry, but i can't. I just can't and I don't know why. My head is full of thoughts, but also kinda empty. It's foggy, like my eyesight is foggy and blurry. I can swear that I smelt my old room, or the torture chamber that I like to call it, my childhood room, where all the fucked up shit happened. Don't know where that came from, I could swear I was back in that house for a second. so weird huh. I feel weird, it feels like I'm not here, I'm not real.

valid_pid_4176	Youth (teen) mental hospital cost? : I have been having frequent thoughts and consideration of self-harm and suicide and think requesting to go to a mental hospital for a bit might help. I’m desperate at this point because nothing has seemed to have been working so far. Countless therapy sessions, talks with my doctor, increasing and decreases my dosage of Prozac, I even got sent to the emergency room one time by my therapist so that they could take me to a mental hospital but deemed me ‘fine’ and sent me on my way even when I looked in the doctors eyes and flatly said ‘I have frequent thoughts of suicidal and yesterday I got the closest to ever cutting myself in my entire life’. The only thing really stopping me from talking to my parents, therapist or doctor about this is worrying about the cost for it happening. My parents already have to pay for so much shit that I’ve caused like my meds, therapy sessions, frequent doctor visits and that one emergency room fluke visit must have cost a shit ton even when all they did was give me a cold hamburger and took my blood. I only feel like it would be an even bigger burden which would only make me more suicidal honestly, which is a bit ironic since I’m trying to go to a mental hospital to get help for that. I’m from Georgia, almost 16 years old now. Do costs vary from area to area? If anyone has any experience with this, what is a general idea of what the cost would be. I have a job right now, so maybe I can save up for my own stay. I’m so desperate at this point that it might come to me just having to pay for it myself. That would probably take over a year honestly and I don’t know how long I have before I do something rash. I appreciate any advice with this, thank you.	severe
train_pid_5640	"Depression shows you the truth of others. : I know for a lot of people depression makes them isolate themselves. I, personally, crave interaction and all I’ve ever wanted was to feel like someone cared for me as much as I did them. I feel like my friends make my depression worse in this way because when I reach out to them during times of crisis or when I want to vent about something, I’m often left with half ass replies or no replies at all. 
It sucks to be someone who is always there for others and to not be met with that same compassion. 
This in itself makes me want to isolate myself from my so called friends because their distance and lack of concern for my well being makes me hate myself and my life more. 
In short, every time I’m at my lowest point I’m met with the reality that no ones cares about me. I feel like it would be easy for someone to assume that “this is the depression talking” but it’s not. The depression just makes it easier to see the reality of others.

train_pid_8593	"forcing myself to appreciate my progress : Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:
1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

I can't function. Therapy doesn't help, anti-depressants don't help, the only thing that helps is sleep, and I want to do that forever. I don't feel anything from music or video games or movies. I got kicked out of choir because I was ""there, but wasn't present"" (I was just going through the motions). Every important relationship in my life has been abusive. I have no friends.

I remember loving my birthdays up to that point. We always had a tradition of singing and cutting the cake during at some point in the night. For my 11th birthday, whatever happened that day, my dad and sister either forgot or didn’t care enough to wish me happy birthday. To add insult to injury, it was just me singing with my mom that night while my dad and sister hung out upstairs with their doors closed. I know this might sound very whiny, and this WAS an isolated incident, but the fact that I can still hear my moms “happy birthday to you” and remember the tears streaming down my face afterwards while I ate my slice in my room just serves as a reminder to how heartbreaking this event(no matter how small or insignificant) was to me. Every year from that point on I’ve cried on every single one of my birthdays. Not just because of this event, but mostly because I’m just always lonely on my birthdays haha.

valid_pid_1532	"I’m a normal 20 year old girl. This is my story of my battle with depression. It’s long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it. : I’m just a 20 year old girl, with an amazing family. I have 2 parents who have given me the world, and I am the oldest sibling of 4. I have had a great education all of my life, I went to an awesome university in my town but I had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. I live on the East Coast, and I have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life I dream of living. I have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. Nowadays though, the life I dream of living consists of these few things: Energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. At this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. 
I took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety I had was starting to take a toll. Originally I had just planned to take a semester off because I wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. I didn’t want to be out for too long because I thought I wouldn’t want to go back. But that was in September. It’s now March, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because I am not in school and I’m watching all of my peers live the life I had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, I have developed depression. At first my psychologist didn’t think I was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. 
What I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. 
I truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? 
I simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** 
I do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. 
My family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. 
Somehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. 
I want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? 
I wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. 
Sometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? 
I wouldn’t wish depression upon anyone. If you read to here then thank you. And if you have any advice, I’m dying to hear it. Happy Friday."	moderate

Rumor is he's screwing another manager but everyone thinks they're good together so it's okay. Last shift I saw him he pretty much bad mouthed me in front of my coworkers and then ignored me the rest of the day. I called in today after having perfect attendance because I didn't have the strength to go in.
My friend was starting to accompany me to the gym, which turned out to be the stupidest choice ever because all she does is flaunt about how fit she is, making me feel like crap. 
I don't know if it's the bad weather or not getting to socialize/go to school because of the Cornavirus. Or maybe my meds have stopped working again. I just want to die. I'm so sick of everyone acting like they like me until they don't. I'm sick of being happy only to feel like shit the next day and laying on thw couch all day just wanting to give up. I just hate this life. I just want something to actually work and actually work full time."	severe

valid_pid_3253	Homeless, But Not Shelterless : Everyone says being homeless is terrible. I’ve learned that every situation is different. I’m homeless, but not because I made poor financial decisions, or choose drugs and lost everything, or lost my job. I’m homeless due to escaping an abusive and toxic environment. I sleep in my car and live out of a storage unit. At first, it was terrible. I was discouraged, scared, angry, all the emotions poured through my body. My first night in my car I ended up in the hospital with an extreme panic attack. As time has gone on, I’ve learned how to adjust, what places are homeless-friendly and what ones are not. I see homelessness with new eyes. I still wish that it wasn’t something that is looked so down on and that homeless people were not seen as “in the way” something that takes up space in society. Many homeless people have no shelter and live on the streets. Many have mental illnesses and can not afford medication to help them, so to others, they seem dirty and crazed. I’m lucky to have my car for my shelter. I have a support system of friends that I met at work that have quickly become family. I have my church family and a few individuals that I met when I first moved here. Things could always be worse. But in a sense, I feel very free. It is still hard, but I feel safer in most ways now than I did when I was in the environment I escaped from. I guess my point is this: Please be kind to everyone, you don’t know what they are going through. They may be smiling on the outside, but broken on the inside. Trying to do the best they can, but still struggling. We are still people, just down on our luck. ❤️	not depression

train_pid_234	"Overwhelmed by how little I feel : I've become emotionally numb to the sorts of moments that seemingly used to be exempt from my depression and it's creating this antsy discomfort in me during moments like watching the new year's ball drop where I expect to have a brief respite and instead just continue to feel nothing.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense."	moderate

I feel like I will never get out of debt. $160,000 in student loans and I’ve been out of school for years and made every payment on time, trying to pay back an additional $9,000 in private loans I used to pay of my credit cards from school because the interest rates were lower, and another $17,000 in credit card debt from paying for a wedding and honeymoon I wish I never did, and am currently in the middle of divorcing.
Now pile on backed up bills that I haven’t been able to pay like car travels and thousands of dollars of medical bills and then I think “I have to pay more if I am going to pick up my meds today and even more for my therapy appointment and even more for my psychiatrist appointment and I can’t help but wonder what is the fucking point of it all. 
I feel eternally stuck. My MDD and GAD feel like they were getting better in the hospital but now that I’m back “home” I feel like the suicidal thoughts are coming back.
I guess I’m just ranting looking for support.

But don’t have time to find a therapist etc. Don’t have time to make friends and seek support. I wouldn’t wanna burden people with having a depressed friend anyways. Or make friends just because I need them right now. I want people to need/want me around.... I don’t think anyone needs or wants to deal with a mentally ill person everyday.  But people make it seem like understanding or caring about someone else’s problems is the hardest thing in the world. They can’t empathize or put themselves in others shoes. I never made myself a “victim” in life even after the countless things I’ve been through. I was never seeking pity or sympathy from anyone, nor did I want them to care... I just wanted people close to me to understand what I’m going through so they could stop adding to my problems. But they don’t care and they don’t even try to understand what I’m going through. They just watch my life falling apart, in silence. Yet they expect me to be involved in their drama whenever they need me involved. 
I can’t believe I’ve been surrounded by heartless, selfish, thoughtless and ignorant humans my entire life. I wish this wasn’t my reality. I wish I could just sleep forever. But I have no choice but to “be strong” and face it all; All because I’m a mom and I have a child to live for. I didn’t plan to be a parent; Baby was a surprise. Fast forward 5 years &gt;&gt; I never imagined life would be so difficult for me! Now I’m tired of pushing through bad times. I’m tired of having to be strong. Tired of having to fight. But recently it’s not only humans affecting me, long term depression has led to procrastination and now Time is tic tocking against. Life is not for the weak. The race is for those who can endure... but I’m not sure I can’t take anymore. I tried it, I couldn't find it and Now I just want to get back to me. The peace I had before life became so difficult. I also got hit by a car while crossing at a cross walk 2 years ago and it ruined my life but who fucking cares. If anyone reads this and comments please don’t comment saying I am seeking pity or making myself a “victim” like my sister says I am because I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want any pity or sympathy, I just wish someone would try to understand what I’m dealing with but no one cares or tries to understand. I just want to die bc death seems like the only way for this nightmare to b over. But I have too much to live for. Feels like I am being forced to stay living in this shitty world. I try to find new things to love about this planet, distract myself from the dark side of my life. But I’m tired of being fucking optimistic all day everyday . Tired of turning the other cheek. All the rage is building up inside of me and I’m worried how it will be released. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I used to smoke weed to calm down and I don’t even want to smoke anymore. Nothing seems appealing anymore except death. I know I need to see a doctor but I seriously don’t have any fucking time for that. I don’t have time for therapy or anything like treatment or recovery.

So much bad stuff happened, that after the real end im left with nothing. I dont have any friends anymore, I dont have anyone to talk to except perhaps my psychologist. Im struggling to even get my high school graduation, because I weren't able to go to school for a month because of my mental health. Im probably at the lowest point ever in my life and I want to do anything to get out. Im trying to workout so I dont hate my body that much anymore, im eating healthy, im going to school to get my graduation, i got into old hobbys that helped me cope with my self hatred for a long time, im trying to learn new stuff and im even trying to find new contacts.
BUT NOTHING WORKS
I still feel like shit and I hate myself, I really fucking do. I still hate my body no matter how many muscles I have, im eating healthy for that exact reason, going to school every day is the worst part because im sitting there and just one wrong thought is sending me down a spiral of self loathing and self hatred were I nearly begin to cry and cant follow the class at all. What is going to make my final exams not really easier. I dont even have friends in school, I always relied on my friends when im at home and didnt care about the people in school but now that I dont have anyone I just hurts so bad going to school and nobody, NOBODY wants to even talk with you. And even though my old hobby's are fun they are not making me feel less empty and the new stuff im trying to learn is just frustrating just like with anything I cant expect to be good at it from the get go but what would be exactly what I need right now. And even if im just not able to be proud of myself at the moment so much bad stuff happened that just left me hurt. I dont know what to do that break up was so bad my mental state was compleatly fucked in the process.
It feels like I cant live without a girlfriend, it just feels like I need someone that actually tells me how much im worth, that im special, that im a kind and unique person, that im deserving of being loved. I just want someone to give me hug and that I feel loved, that I dont have to be ashamed of my body and that just gets rid of all these thoughts.
But that is so messed up, why do I need other people to tell me all that? I want to be able to love myself not because other people tell me to but because I work hard.

So tonight my boyfriend and I had plans (since like four days ago) to meet up at my place to discuss some things and spend some time together. Lately we had some serious problems and we are thinking about breaking up. Also lately I’ve been really down, like not going out, not even getting out of bed and doing nothing all day down. I’m also really stressed out about the coronavirus. 
So his friends made some plans to meet up today at a friend’s place and he said we should go together etc and I said well you know that’s impossible, I can’t hang out and especially with your friends because I don’t feel comfortable around them I don’t know them well and I can’t tell them about my situation. But I said you should go if you feel like you need to spend time with your friends and you want to hang out. And well I said that because it was the right thing to do but he actually went and I feel so fucking alone. 
I ruin everything, I can’t even go and hang out at a friend’s house and have fun. Hell, I can’t even get out of the house. I haven’t seen anyone for a week now and before that day it was like another two weeks. I just want some company. And he is the only one right now who knows what I’m going through so none of my friends are like you know what if you don’t want to go out I’ll come to your place because they don’t know I want to go out but I can’t so they just thing I want to stay in and do nothing about it. Of course it’s my mistake because I don’t tell them what’s going on and how I feel but fuuuckk I feel so alone. My eyes are so red I’m sick of crying ugh why is it so difficult to talk?

Of course she’s quite gorgeous but that’s besides the point. I really hate myself for not being good enough. Obviously if I was good enough things would be different but I just wasn’t enough in someway or another... possibly and quite certainly more. Idk what to do with myself.

valid_pid_2592	I’m feeling a lot better lately : So I posted to this reddit a few days ago wondering what is wrong with my life and what I have to do to fix it. I’ve spent these past 2 days with my best friend since childhood and got to spend time with two more friends of my close friends. This morning him and I did a pretty extreme session of workouts and we plan to continue it because our schools have closed down for a long time due to the virus going around. I’ve had the idea of God on my mind a lot more lately. Maybe I just needed a purpose and a little going back to my old ways to cure what I could only describe as a phase of depression. Things are getting better, they surely aren’t 100% but I feel so much happier when I spend time with my good friends and get some time away from my family, not that my family is bad of anything, they can just be stressful. I currently have little to no commitments due to the shutdown of things in my city because of the virus and all I have is time, I thought my mental state would deteriorate vastly over this next break, but it’s done quite the opposite, I feel so much better. I hope and believe it will continue going this way. I will continue praying and searching for answers of what I can do to fix my mental state even more and search for answers of what I can do to find myself truly happy. I’ve been visiting my psychologist more lately too and that helps me find those answers. I also think I might have some form of OCD which debilitates me from time to time but I’ve never been diagnosed or really even talked to anyone about it besides my mom so I don’t know? If you have any comments of suggestions they would be much appreciated. Feel free to reach out to me in the comments or direct message. I’m thinking about trying church out again too, tomorrow morning I plan on visiting a close friend of mine who is in the hospital (and isn’t ever going to recover from his injury, he has been in a vegetative state for years and I just go to be supportive to an extent so don’t worry to much about it) but hopefully it will put me at rest a little more.	not depression

You can work out and have a healthy diet but you'll never have a body like people who were never fat. Had a drinking or drug problem? You will never get back those lost years and any intelligence/health you lost as a result. Missed an opportunity? Never connected with a possible friend/partner? You will never get those chances again. I hate it when people act like you can just pick up from where you are and make things better. People live and they make mistakes. Those mistakes change you, they compound and they change your future. It's not true that you can achieve anything. Maybe when you're a kid, it's true to an extent, but as soon as you start getting to adolescence, the choices you make start putting you on a track in life, and it's near impossible to get off that track. 
People fuck up their lives, and there is no way to fix it. You just have to live with the fucked up life forever. A lot of the time there isn't really anything you can do other than 'hope for the best'. I see people talk about their sadness and loneliness as reasons for wanting to kill yourself. What about people who feel like they've just made a few too many wrong decisions in the game of life? What are people like that supposed to do? How can you keep living when you know that you will never achieve X, you will never reach your full potential, you will never live your dreams? Why live when you have no hope of making things better?

valid_pid_4370	"Had a nightmare about suicide : I haven’t had a major depressive episode in three years. When I was depressed, I had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and I’ll never forget them. Lately, I’ve been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday I had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up.
In the dream, it was a sunny day and I was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. There was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and I went to go hang out with them; but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious (in real life she’s not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so I don’t know why I conjured this up). She was saying stuff like “well when I jump off a bridge this won’t matter” and everyone was laughing, but I burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffering. To make matters worse, I was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. One of the other people in the group looked at me while I was crying and asked, “what’s wrong?” and I said “because none of these people around me will be here after I end my life.”
Then I started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people’s parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could’ve done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. I said to myself “I hate thinking about suicide” and cried even harder, and then I “woke up” in the dream (but not actually in real life). Then after I woke up from that dream into another dream, I was suddenly in my best friend’s house traumatized from that dream I had. I was going to see my girlfriend soon, but I was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though I have her. Then I actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated.
I wanted to tell my friends about the dream I had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so I thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it."	severe

I have been on it for about 4 days now and the past three days have been fine, and today was fine until about 8 hours after I took it. I was in a store and just felt lightheaded and fatigued. I walked out the store and laid in my car for about an hour and then I started to slowly regain my energy. I’m still getting back to normal actually. Other than these symptoms I’ve had a positive experience with Wellbutrin boosting my energy levels.	moderate

I had a group of ""friends"" with whom i liked to play games and all that. We would very frequently play for hours. I was quite bonded to them (but they weren't to me that much). One day they treated me very badly and kicked me from their group. This hurt me a lot, because they treated me cruelly just because something small and insignificant.
A few days later, i decided to go into their game and troll (basically ruin their game because of what they did to me). One of those guys said that for me even garbage is a compliment. I feel so bad now about myself and i am starting to fear it might be true.

train_pid_625	"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)"	moderate
valid_pid_801	"Feeling especially detached and lonely today while I travel. : I’ve been feeling especially detached from my self and really lonely today. I’ve been traveling for work and I’m alone and away from my family, friends and SO. My job requires me to travel often and sometimes I find myself feeling further away from myself and hard to ground myself. I’ve had depression, anxiety and derealization/depersonalization for almost half my life so for the most part I’ve learned how to cope and function the best I can. Today is one of those days where these feelings are hitting me hard and I’m feeling very lost. 
I worked a 60 hour week and on Thursday it all started to catch up to me - the sleep deprivation, anxiety and stress. Usually being at work helps distract me from those feelings of detachment and loneliness but I started feeling more anxious and out of my body and became very aware of it. It became hard to talk to other people because I would feel like it wasn’t me who was talking in the middle of my sentences and then start focusing on those thoughts instead of the present moment. I don’t get to go home until the end of this week and I’m having some trouble coping. I don’t know how I’m going to get through this week if I keep feeling this way especially in the workplace. I’m feeling really lonely, far away from everyone (especially during this state of panic where all my friends get to work from home) and these feelings are escalating. There’s a feeling in my chest that just feels really down and I want to cry right now. It’s starting to affect my mental state as well as how I function at work. 
Would greatly appreciate any advice or words of comfort. 
TLDR: Traveling for work this week has started to take a toll on me and I’m feeling very depressed and away from myself and everything around me."	moderate
valid_pid_2250	"Anyone else wish they could fall into a coma? : I don't like life very much right now. There's a lot of problems I have which have no real possible answer, and my favorite thing to do is sleep because it numbs my brain from stuff like this. I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to cause any distress like that to my family, so I wish I could just slip into a coma one way or another.
I just need, any sort of extended break from reality, holy fuck. Sleep is a nice break, but it does not last long at all. I'm only 17; I don't have it nearly as bad as most others here do, I apologize. But just, nothing feels special about life anymore. Things are kind of difficult now, but looking at the future, it only looks like things are going to get even more difficult, and that's something I wish I could veer away from, but it doesn't look like that's within my power.
I don't want to die, I'm scared of finding out what's on the other side, but stuff like sleep and comas are pretty much as close as one can get to being dead without actually dying as far as I'm aware. Thanks for reading my vent, I hope you have a great day."	moderate

valid_pid_4337	"I’m so god damn tired.... : Hello... the title, basically. I should probably use a throw away but I don’t care anymore. I’m gonna warn this is mostly me bitching and whining, I’m really not that interesting.
To start, last year, my mom and cat died the same month. My cat actually died the week of my mother’s funeral. I was very, very close with her. She was he entire reason I went to college for a degree. My cat was there for me since I was a little kid, losing her was like losing a piece of myself... before I had a brain injury. She was all that was left to tie me to normality. Sure you could argue nobody is normal, but that isn’t easy to hear when you’re bullied relentlessly for being weird. I actually had to leave high school it got so bad.
To top all this shit off, I got denied disability for the second time, so now I have to wait another two years just to fucking hear no again. I submitted two fucking banker boxes of my medical problems, two!
I also need to deal with voc rehab since they helped me but I can’t fucking work with my disability, I’ve shadowed two different jobs and failed horribly. I barely finished college despite my longest day being 6 hours, with two of that being a break period. I feel useless and hopeless. I’m 25, poor, and draining my bf of his money. I just want to sleep and not wake up. Or have cybernetics let me have a cyborg body so my muscles and nerves aren’t as weak and painful as an 80 year old. 
I’m not going to do anything, mostly because I don’t even have the energy to attempt. But I’m also stuck in hell of struggling to sleep despite being exhausted all the time. I wish I was normal, I wish I wasn’t a fucking leach on society. I want to help so fucking bad but every doctor I’ve seen (5) has said I can’t work. Anxiety on phone, can’t do simple math, have a seizure disorder (so lots of places won’t want to hire me for that risk, they just have to claim something else to not be sued) can’t drive, and can’t lift more than 40 lbs. I also have pathetically low stamina, like the walk to my mail box wears me out. Yet the judge thinks I can fucking work.
...who knows, maybe I just have a victim complex. I know I’ve tried, but it still feels like I didn’t try hard enough, that I’m a failure, useless. This is with me on two different anti depressants that for the most part work, I’m sure without them... well... idk. It wouldn’t be good.
I’m sorry Mom, I’m a fucking failure. Your support was for nothing...."	severe

I was diagnosed with OCD, PTSD and depression 1 year ago and it's only been getting worse since then.
I live in student home at college not far away from home (unfortunately) and my mom calls me today and says ""Yea...your 'DePreSsiOn' is just your hormones during puberty. Tell your therapist to stop overreacting because I have enough problems with my life already.""...of course I hung up and took 2 pills because I felt a panic attack coming. 
I literally have NOBODY. My dad is abusive, egoistic man who doesn't care about anyone but himself and my mom. I have no friends because of social phobia and anorexia, depression etc...I guess they are all scared of me somehow. My grandma passed away, my grandfather is abusive too and everyone else is either dead or too far away.

I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.
Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 
Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again.

This morning I was supposed to go on a dream trip, Singapore to Vietnam to Japan then back home. I should probably preface that with I also recently returned back from seeing my recently divorced parents for Christmas (found out my dad now has a kid with a woman my age) and I’ve been a wreck. For a lot of reasons that I won’t go into, but it was just the icing on the cake. Ever since I got back from seeing my parents I’ve been breaking down, maybe it’s because I finally opened up to my mom about some of the sexual abuse I endured as a child, I’m not sure. Anyway, everyday has been just hell. Constant racing thoughts, feeling like offing myself was the only way to cope, drugs, you name it and I’ve been there. Anyway, I got to the airport, went through security and arrived at my gate. As soon as I was about to board I lost it again, just broke down. Something in me was telling me what I was doing was wrong. After wiping away my tears I told the boarding agent I needed someone to get my bag off the plane and that I could not go anymore do to personal reasons, I then proceeded to break out crying again. But as soon as I left and I got back home my whole mood did a 180. It’s so hard to explain but walking away just felt right. I haven’t been this happy in a long time. I was so worried leading up to the trip about this and that and then having every bad memory from my childhood come up over Christmas, I was just in a terrible space. It’s so wild toe that I can be feeling this good about losing all that money, not experiencing the world, letting those down who knew I was going on the trip, none of that matters because I finally know what it feels like to listen to your gut and intuition. 

I know that was probably all over the place but I’m sober and happy and feeling optimistic about life.

valid_pid_2904	"Vent : Good day. I just thought I'd vent here to see if it'd even remotely help.
I've been dealing with depression for over half a year now. It started when my grandmother's health began to rapidly deteriorate because of cancer. She passed away exactly half a year ago. It broke my heart - she was a second mother to me. Raised me, was always at my side during the most important events of my life and would never stop being proud of me. A month and a half later, I lost an equally important person (my first romantic partner) because of sins of a sexual nature. We made a promise to abstain from such themes, but kept failing and I'm the one to take most of the blame for it. They've cut all communication save for a few, very minor interactions. I even lost all of my friends, save for a couple of them, in the span of a week. 
As it stands, I'm deeply depressed and don't seem to be making much, if any, progress. I used to try to be as devoted a Christian as I could, but I've even let go of my faith. I have an immense amount of hate inside of me. Hate towards myself for not being able to overcome this sadness, even when I'm going to a psychiatrist. For making my parents (who are aware of this situation) and the few friends I have left worried. For all the mistakes I made and keep making. Hate towards the fact that my grandmother had to leave us. I don't even know if I hate the person I broke up with or the fact that they left me in such an apparently easy way in a couple of moments. Hell, I know for a fact that they've been better off since the breakup. Hate towards sadness itself. Nowadays, most of the things I feel are either sadness, anger or guilt. The worst part is, I've convinced myself that I deserve this, that I shouldn't be happy, that I should remain depressed, so on and so forth. 
My parents keep saying that I'll have a bright future, or that I'll grow up to be a good person. It's the same thing my grandmother and ex used to say. I feel as though it makes things worse. I try to be sympathetic and understanding towards everyone else, but I can't do so the same effect as before given all of my problems. I also try to pull myself together for the sake of my parents and younger brother, but I never succeed. I wish they'd let me die. 
The combination of being tossed aside, losing my friends and more has made me feel worthless. I'm an incredibly miserable conglomerate of depression, hate and guilt and I can't see things getting any better. I sincerely believe myself to be a lost cause, and that the best, most straightforward solution to this whole predicament is to end it all. I could shoot myself, overdose on any pills I find, jump in the middle of the road... the list goes on.
I'm impossibly tired all the time. I've lost interest in stuff I used to like. I don't even feel like I'm living. Come to think of it, I can't find a point or reason behind writing this. It didn't even make me feel any better.
Sorry if this made you worried. I wish you the best."	not depression
valid_pid_1666	"How can I cheer up : I feel like my friends which I have known for most of my life have become tired of me because I am hyperactive. I have found out they have had a number of plans without me and I feel like they just don't like me anymore. Feeling this, I tried to make new friends, but the same thing happened even quicker with them. I have found a friend group now who are nicer and for now, don't dislike me. My mum can see I am depressed sometimes and she thinks it's because I spend my weekends indoors on technology (because I never get invited to anything), so she tries tirelessly to get me out the house and to try something new. However, most of these things I find very boring or not something I would like to do, and she gets upset and angry at me because she thinks I would rather spend all my time indoors and I am depressed because of it. This is not true, as I am completely fine with being at home for a day, or having no friends. What I can't bare is not knowing if my friends really like me or not. My mum (like I'm sure many others do) drags me to these places I would rather not be, as she thinks it is in my best interests. Not wanting to go to many of these places, I often act sad and negative when we go, which ruins it for her and makes her feel upset. I hate for my mum to feel sad, though I physically can't have a positive attitude to these things/I can't cheer up even if I want to. The same thing happens every weekend: she talks to me about this new place she wants to take me, I commonly reject it, she begs me to come out, i either go or I don't, but either way she ends up becoming sad and not enjoying her day. I feel like a failure and a dissapointment, as I have lost all my hobbies to my sadness. 
Summary: I feel like my mum doesn't understand my problems and thinks it's because I don't get out, when really it's my social issues. I tell her this, but she insists that going out is the best way to help, which I know it is. 
When she tries to find something to do I often dislike it or don't want to go, which puts me in a low mood as I'm being forced to do something I don't want to, and this ruins whatever we plan to do or are doing for my mum.

I left the house today without anyone knowing and I just walked and walked until I just completely broke down, I was just sitting there so helpless. What really is the point, I eventually went back home but I’m just not feeling the same anymore
Can anyone please help me? this really sucks ://"	moderate
valid_pid_4082	always i'll care : kind of realised today that i get deeply attached to people, and even if we stop talking or becoming strangers, i'll always care about them, more than they will ever now. it's fucking unfair and it hurts, but maybe it's something i should accept.	not depression
valid_pid_607	"Does anyone else struggle with empathy? Too much or too little? : For a long time now I’ve felt a sense of detachment from the people I know. There are probably only five people in my life that I consistently feel empathy for, otherwise it’s like they’re strangers. I feel callous and selfish but I always think that realistically they don’t care about me either. It just feels performative when something bad happens and everyone reacts with horror just because it’s what you *should* do. Does the cousin I’ve seen once in the past year actually care about me? What about the brother I didn’t grow up with? Why should I care about these people? Why don’t I feel *anything* for them?
But then I consistently feel intense empathy for absolute strangers. I’ll watch the news and a brief mention of our local homeless population will bring tears to my eyes, or I’ll see a video on reddit of a man listening to his dead son’s heartbeat and start openly crying. It’s not just strangers either, I feel overly empathetic toward fictional people, too. I’ll feel gutted for days after I read or watch anything even a little sad. 
I feel like there’s this persistent malaise in my life and I can’t care about anything that’s real. Everything feels fake and it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is the constant daydream."	moderate

train_pid_8580	"Hating what I used to love : I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.
I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.
But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 
I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.
Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 
I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 
I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.
I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  
I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated."	severe

valid_pid_4420	"I will kill myself within 2 days : I will turn 18 this Tuesday. I gave myself enough time. Nothing happened. I've tried reaching out and seeking help. People don't really care. Even if they say they do, they never show it in action. I posted another cry for help on Reddit before (with another account) but moderators deleted it for no reason before someone even replies. I've tried therapy, psychiatrists didn't help. In fact, opening up to people actually made it worse. I just want people to consider my mental condition and treat me better instead of giving me advice. But at least after therapy I know that I have Autism, Psychotic Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, OCD, Maladaptive Daydreaming Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I think I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. I know what is happening when one of my other personalities is controlling me, but I have no control over what thay say or what they do. One of my psychiatrists said I'm just ""too schizophrenic"". I can't communicate with people. I can't have long lasting friendships. I have never felt loved and I don't even know what it means or feels like. I don't feel empathy or sympathy.
I gave myself time to think about this. I realized something: I don't want to just end the pain, I don't want to live. I'm tired of waking up and trying to survive the day just to do the same repetitive things that I do everyday. I don't want a job, I don't want money, I don't want to graduate. I seriously don't want anything from life. But that's not the worst part. I live in Iran. In Iran when guys turn 18 they have to go to military academy for 2 years (or you can keep graduating and then go to military academy after you're done, but it's a rule and you can't escape from it). I can't even imagine 2 years without my PC. After all it's one of the things that kept me alive. I wish I could live in another country, but that needs a lot of money and I have to take IELTS test and go to military academy anyway. Otherwise I'm stuck here. Hold on a second... If I live in another country I need a job, so it would be pointless.
The other thing that kept (or maybe keeps) me alive is my daydreaming. Real life is very boring and repetitive. If I could live in my daydreaming forever, it would be nice. Something like a different world which I could live in. People in my daydreams are all fictional characters and I like them more than real life people. That's why I can't just quit it and go find real friends. They actually helped me a bit with their emotional support.
There is no other way. Nothing will change if I stay alive, and I can't change anything myself. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it, the story of my life doesn't have a good ending. I wanted to give myself 1 more year, but that's just pointless. I will kill myself on my birthday.
Now don't tell me I have so much to live for, everything will be okay, it will end someday. Tell me whatever you think is actually helpful. Only if my post won't be deleted like before."	severe

valid_pid_3202	"So lost and confused with myself. Never usually reach out for help, but I've gotten to a point in my life im just so lost..... : In the 28 years of life that i have lived, i have been through hell after hell. Now, dont get me wrong, there are probably millions of people that have it worse off than i do. Its just that after constantly being crushed down, manipulated, abused, and more recently having your only kid taken away for no reason. 
I have had depression for the majority of my life. Being put on drugs as a kid, beaten when out of line, bullied in every single school i went to and there were quite a few because my parents moved around alot growing up so never really had a set school. Never had my first relationship till 21 which lasted for a year and a half. She broke up with me after beating me in a hotel room, and when i went to cops with pics, texts, evidence out the arse, etc., they too laughed at me because im a man. 2nd relationship i was cheated on for the entirety of the 8 months with her ""best friend"". The last one i had was just over a year. Lived together before we started dating, ended up feeling she was the one and proposed (never really liked marriage but for her i wanted it) she then got pregnant with my only child and has, since 2nd month of pregnancy, made my life miserable and broke me in ways i cant even explain (really, really long story of manipulation, heart break, and trauma). 
Including all of my family life, personal life, relationship life, i have never been the one for revenge, or wishing death upon anyone. Ive always been the ""give you the shirt off my back"" kind of person, even if i dont know you. I always treated everyone (family, friends, lovers, strangers) with my utmost respect and always did everything i could in between to have a good life and be happy but its gotten to a point now where everything around me has crumbled down and i have a pain and emptiness inside of me i have never had before. I honestly feel so lost and feel my life is slipping away and nothing i do or try to do is pulling it back.
If you read this novel of a ""life story"" i wrote, i really do appreciate it, and any advice or ""tips"" i can get to shine some light on this never ending darkness would be very helpful. Again, thank you so much for taking the time, i know it was alot &lt;3"	not depression

valid_pid_2277	"Anyone struggling might find this helpful, so here it is : \*No theory or claim in this letter is based on scientific fact or has been in any way proven. The theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. 
As an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. Strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. Depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. One main misconception about ""curing"" depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. Happiness doesn't have a formula. Any doctor that claims to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your time.   
Many non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. I'm not an exception. I attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and I'm doing well in school. But I also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. I cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when I wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? 
Naturally, given my well off parents, I received every treatment / therapy you could imagine in my quest to shake my depression. None of it had any effect. I continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals; that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. My depression got to the point where I wasn't even sure if I liked my intermediate family anymore. One day, I snapped. I just left. Not for long, only about 6 hours, but in those 6 hours, I learned more about the way life works than I had in my previous 20 years.
In those 6 hours I learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you: you know what's best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. When it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. This is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. They are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. But this is the exact opposite for the brain. 
Every brain on planet earth is distinct and unique. I would describe the brain using the 90/10 theory. 90% of the human brain is a result of evolution. We all have the same survival instincts and similar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. This area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything ""normal humans"" do. Your 90% is what makes you human. However, it is the 10% of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. Your 10% is who you are, what separates you from other humans. Ideally, individuals will let their 10% loose and really express who they are. This is unfortunately very far from reality. As I have pointed out and will continue to, society isn't good for the individual. Society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are ""better"" than someone. Due to the competitive side that exists in the 90%, societal expectations take control over your 10%, hindering you from truly being you. More on the process of taking control of your 10% below.
I'm still developing my craft as a writer and couldn't find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here's a really awkward and out of place sentence. Social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you don't meet these expectations. For the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this: go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. It didn't occur to me until my sophomore year (I had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point) of college ""what if I don't want to meet these expectations?"" 
For some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. Accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, sometimes even family. I understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but I promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you won't care about other peoples opinions of you. The people who truly care about you will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life.  
It is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. Take the risk to be your own person. Own your 10%.  
The 3 big takeaways
* ""Good"" ""Happy"" ""Happiness"" are all relative terms. Just because something makes you happy, doesn't mean it will make someone else happy.
* This one is more directed at parents. I understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit (I am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise). That being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as I have, they're old enough to start formulating their own decisions. If your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he/she wants to pursue, not what you want him/her to pursue or what you think he/she should pursue. I'm not saying step completely out of his/her life, but as your child matures, it is important to take more of an advisor type role. As tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them.
* You know what's best for you. Don't be afraid to pursue what you love to do. Own your 10%.

I've struggled through depression and feel like sharing this experience could potentially help out other individuals, so here it is. Any questions, feel free to comment!"	moderate

train_pid_5599	"Choosing a date is so liberating : I thought long and hard about this. Very long. I've had 4 hours sleep in the last two days. In that amount of time I've come to the conclusion that no matter what I do, no matter how I fight my demons, or how much progress I make. I will never have what I want and need, never. I don't understand why I am being looked down on for making a choice. Someone once said that we all have choices, and we're adults free to make them. So, my choice is to not have my current life as I know it. It is so hard to explain to people what exactly I feel. I've tried, but what's the point? 
There's a million possible ways my life could turn out. Everyone keeps saying you know, you could be this you could live there or work here blah blah fucking blah. Like, I don't care if there is better days ahead. 
There isn't to me. I have my memories. And that is it. There is no better day to come because I have had them all already, not including some other major life events. I won't have them. I won't have children, or a house. Or a marriage, or a car. I'll just have what ifs and what could have beens. I'm not prepared to give up on what I, what we had planned. I'm just not. I mentally and physically cannot let go. I never ever ever will and nothing else will come close to them, nothing. I can't live a lie and I'm not sure I can continue on in the state that I am in. 
My entire life changed nearly a year ago. I've always been a bad person, with a flame inside of me. I worked hard and long to get that as little as possible, and under control. I really did. I was still flawed but the flame was at least manageable. But then fuel was dumped on it and I have not been able to put it out since then, And gotten to used to fuelling it myself. It's grown bigger than me.
I've had my reasons to be on this Earth, I've had my goals, my plans, my purpose, my love.
Had.
Someone tell me, what is it your supposed to do when they all slip away and disappear? Just, 'dust yourself off' and move on? Has anyone considered even for a second that I can't, but more importantly don't want to move on? Time heals all wounds? What if you know deep down in your heart and fucking rotten soul that this, this path I have to walk down will not heal this? As I said, sure it might scab over but then I'd be an imposter. And I'd pick at that scab untill I'm old and worn out. I just can't do it.
If I could fix the things I've done, I would. I just wish I knew how. But I can't. Some things are unfortunately permanent. So, the way I see it, I'll continue on untill that date comes around. I'll do everything in my power to fix my fucked up brain, to ask the questions I need to ask, why I'm like this, what could I do to change. I'll try to live a bit, do the right things, see beauty in the world. Except it would all just be hollow. And fake. Empty.
But once that date comes around it's just the time for me. It's my time to make my choice.

I don’t want to get called an edgy 15 yearold but these are my genuine thoughts and emotions. I’ve had people say shit like I’m faking how I feel and that’s why I don’t share anything about it. I just need some guidance.
Look, for the past 2 years, I’ve felt a constant emptiness. I feel like I’m in a void. I feel like a burden to everyone and everything around me. I come home everyday after school and just sleep because I don’t want to deal with the bullshit of life. I sometimes struggle with accepting myself and my homosexuality. I don’t want to be this way. I really dont. The struggle of accepting myself is something that never goes always. That adds on for me. In June of this year, I began having genuine suicidal thoughts. I try to force these thoughts out and convince myself otherwise but it never helps. Only makes them worse. I’ve never self harmed but I have thought about it multiple times. Im too scared to say anything to my parents on how I feel. I want to get a therapist but I also don’t want my parents to just be like “oh you can talk to me, you don’t need one” because I don’t feel comfortable talking to them.

The government is allowed to ask for the records of my conversation if they wish too at any time (I know it might sound stupid to some of you but WHAT IF they do ask for it ?!

Life feels robotic. Living feels mechanical and draining. The ritualistic process carried from one day to another. Lately, the tampering sadness in me is starting to swallow me alive.

I can’t help but miss the sweet, simple childhood I’ve had but was taken for granted. Daring to reach adulthood only to feel at a loss with life and all it has to offer. I’ve only reached the first steps of adulthood but have never felt more strained and overwhelmed as each day passes. Forcing myself to get up, make the bed, and distracting myself through self-made chores have became numbly overbearing.

train_pid_2268	"depressed ex sending weird signals : So after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after I ghosted her boring message,  I texted my ex telling her I cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. She replied with a “yeah well you too” I didn’t reply. Later in the day she sent me a Snapchat telling me she was drunk (New Years eve) nothing else interesting though. I was like yay have fun, and we didn’t talk the rest of the night (she’s in Europe rn I’m in the states). I didn’t send her a happy New Years or anything when it turned midnight here. In the morning I woke up to a “happy New Years, and all the best for you! 🥰” i replied with a “thanks and you too”. No other text communication although I replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. 

I’m confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said couldn’t feel anything, and later said she couldn’t love me or anyone else right now. I find it kind of weird she’d include the lovey emoji, she doesn’t use them much and it’s just something I feel an ex wouldn’t send to someone they broke up with. She’s also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad I ghosted her (understandable) and has never been the type to double text or contact first. 

Any thoughts? I’m not desperate to get back together, I know maybe she’s just trying to be nice and be friends (I’m not interested in a platonic friendship, I’ll be nice and talk sometimes but I’m not going to be friendzoned) but I feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something."	moderate

I actually worked quite hard for it and after the exams were over I took a break of 2 months from the studies. Maybe they said all that bad stuff cause they were angry but it's too late now. The thing that hurts me the most is that neither of them have still said ""You did good. "" Infact other family relatives have said that. Because of this thing happening to me I lost all my ambition of doing something and now don't study anything and there are chances I might fail.

I’ve been depressed since I was 11 or 12, I’m 17 now. There have been highs and lows and especially now it just keeps changing. I could be happy for a while only to get really depressed for the while after. I’ve noticed I’ve been getting really dark “I would rather be dead” thoughts lately, something which I haven’t had in a long time. 
I used to cut myself but I stopped and I don’t feel the need to do it again but sometimes it comes into my head and it makes it worse. I’ve tried antidepressants (setraline 50mg) but I had to stop taking them before they fully kicked in because I couldn’t function in school. But without them I can’t function at school anyway because everyone seems to annoy me and I just would rather be home in bed asleep.
I’ve also tried counselling more than once but it didn’t help. I couldn’t seem to open up at all and at the last therapist I seen I started crying because of how uncomfortable I felt because I couldn’t open up, I wanted, even needed to talk to someone and I was pushing myself to do so for weeks but it didn’t change anything.
I find that odd though because I seem to be able to open up with my friends, depends on what type of mood I’m in but I would always at least say something about how I was feeling.
I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know what to do but I just want it to stop, I want to be genuinely happy and to stop all the shit that’s in my head.

How this relates to my depression is that I have to stay cooped up in my house and I don't know when it will end. I normally go and see a counselor to help me with things that are bothering me, and he really helps me to get back on a good path, and now with everyone having to stay home, I can't do that. Also, my school is out because of the outbreak, and so I can't even see my friends, and I normally talk to them about stuff like sports and music to try to take my mind off stuff, and it helped me in really rough times. 
Other than that, 2020 in general has been a never ending circle of shit, as I went through a depressive state for a month and a half, which saw my grades drop off massively which caused even more stress in the family, and only a week ago, one of my closest friend's mother died, which put me even further into a hole, and now the Coronavirus outbreak and having to isolate myself is the icing on the cake for me.

valid_pid_4395	"I Want To Die and Don't Want Help : I don't know what the point of this post is, random people can't really help with the issue. I've been depressed since around 12, started taking meds at 17 and stopped at 20. I'm about to turn 21.
In those 9 years I've wanted to die, to kill myself. I visualize it happening and ever since I was 13 it felt like it was destined to happen. I still think this way. I was closed off and alone my whole life, I have no social skills and can be pretty emotionally unstable if I don't put walls up and just be indifferent to everything. This helped me avoid too many suicidal ideations in high school, but when I went to college I resolved to talk to a therapist and psychiatrist, and be open and try to make my empty life less empty.
It failed, the meds did not help. I was being emotionally open and connected with people, made some friends and even a boyfriend and lost them all due to my intense mood swings and bouts of suicidal actions. I tried to kill myself twice in 2019 then dropped out of college because I missed so much class from hospitalizations. 
I shut off and I'm back to being empty and not interacting with people. I can't do it. I have no support network, I need to be alone and sad because it's more stable and less dangerous than the alternative. As I realized this and started taking classes online, I know I'll kill myself in ~5 years if I continue this way. I want to get some job, move away so my parents don't find the body, and work up the nerve to do things right this time.
Every few months I feel this want to die or to cease to exist become stronger and I'm doing nothing to fix it. Do I even want help? Do i think I can be helped? I don't know anymore. All I know is that trying to get better made things so much worse, I don't have a stable enough support network to try that again. Truthfully no one thinks about me and no one cares to talk with me, I've actively isolated myself and done a 10/10 job. 
Does it stop? Can it even stop if I don't do something different? I can't/won't do anything different so am I just going to keep daydreaming about dying as it becomes more and more of a reality?  I'm pathetic and a lost cause, and I wish every night that I just won't wake up. I deserve to be dead, the only thing I'm worthwhile as is worm food. As dumb and bad as it sounds, I either don't want help or think I deserve help/can be helped.

valid_pid_2621	"I was high. What can i say? : **So this is what i wrote whilst stoned on cannabis:**
I share with you something that have complexed and swamped my mind for years. What is life with happiness?
Happiness is defined as “the state of being happy.”, but what does “happy” mean? “happy” is defined as “feeling or showing pleasure or contentment.”. Showing pleasure? But how is pleasure shown? What is “pleasure”? Why is it the fundamental lining of life itself? Why is it the one thing we desire the most but fail to gain successfully?
Pleasure is expressed and described as the way our brain expresses enjoyment, excitement and exploration. Therefore, most addictions are caused by pleasure.  surely then life is an addictions since it is caused and causes pleasure?
**With this theorem, I can give you an answer to the truly unanswerable question, “What is life?”. My answer,**
“Life is an addiction which causes pleasure amongst its beings. Life is not alive and has no achievable goal. It is purely a means of giving meaning to other beings. By not having “pleasure” or “happiness”, you are simply a being without meaning. Therefore, you should make everything pleasurable and express everything as happiness because life is an addiction that cannot be overcome. Therefore, it must be controlled.”"	not depression

I'm almost 14 years old now, btw, which makes this story all the more harder to tell. But anyhow, I hung out with this girl in the neighborhood, and soon, I asked her out. Late October, she moved out, and I had no idea about it until they were long gone. We'd either meet up in the woods, somewhere in the neighborhood, or my house, never her's. She didn't even say goodbye, I was destroyed when I heard about it. But this isn't all. I actually fell into depression when the next door neighbor kid, my only friend anymore, said that we couldn't hang out anymore, of which the reasons are beyond me. Late December, another girl moved in. I hung out with her for a bit, then she asked me out. This definitely lightened my depression, but not all of it. It was early January when she broke up with me by these exact words, ""YOU DISGUSTING, CONSPIRACIST HOB-GOBLIN! GET OFF OF MY PORCH, YOU VILE CREATURE, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT FACE EVER AGAIN!"" I was so completely devastated that I cried the rest of that day and through the night. I'd ignore my parents. I'd ignore my few school friends and teachers. This caused my grades to fall, causing constant harassment of my family and teachers, and a huge loss of friends. In late January, she came to my house with a silver ring, a raven. She apologized for her ""nasty"" behavior, and we talked for a while. My parents were out of town, so we went back to my house. We chatted, then we, this is kinda hard for me, I ate her out. So, the next day, I went over to her house, unannounced. I saw her kiss some other dude, who left after that. I ran home crying, again.

I am a 15 (almost 16) year old male, living in a middle eastern country that little people know of, named Jordan. I'm currently one of (if not) the worst in terms of marks in school. I have a strong PC addiction, mostly playing 5 hours on school days, and up to 12 hours on weekends. I find studying nearly impossible, I just, I cant get motivation to study.
Worst part is that I've been feeling nothing but sadness, and I have been finding myself repeatedly deciding on which is the best way I could end my life. At this rate, suicide for me, is just, inevitable.
I recognize my problem, and I want professional help, I want to go to a psychologist, but I come to the truth that **psychologists do not really exist in my country**. A quick search of google maps reveals no real psychologists, and to add insult to injury, depression is usually very neglected in my country. If I reveal my depression, the first response is to say ""you're a spoiled kid"". My family is likely to travel to europe in 2 months, and I want to seek help there, but I simply cannot get money as a 15 year old in order to pay for therapy. I'm not even sure if I am allowed to go to a psychologist alone. I simply cannot tell my parents that I'm suicidal, I just, I cant, I dont want them to intervene, I want to solve this without them, it would be humiliating for me.
I always question my self - why am I really here, why cant I just leave?
I've already decided on a method of suicide, and it will probably happen within a year at this rate. I have no value in life, nobody likes me, I'm not good at anything. I'm just a useless observing rock that consumes resources.

Ever since the quarantine I've been struggling with oversleeping, I don't have practice so I don't have a reason to wake up in the morning. Staying awake worked though, I cleaned the whole kitchen, room, living room, indoor patio and bathroom. It took me all morning but it feels great."	not depression

Shes going to end up needing a surgery that will cost 2k in a town 5 hours away. My moms house needs around 10k of repairs done or else we are risking out health living in mold. I dont give 2 shits about my health but I want my mom, and her pest to be healthy. She cant afford any of this so I'm obligated to pay for all of it. I personally saved 7k, and I have about 17k in my trust fund, and another 60k in a little while because my brother will be buying out my half of the house. I would just use that money to pay for repairs, and such, but my dad, and mom dont get along, so my dad would be livid if I used my trust fund on my mother's house. I know my grand parents wouldnt be happy iether. I know I'm probably being a little bitch, but I just needed to vent about this.	moderate

But I have no friends. My family is all estranged. The only family members I do have all live states away.

valid_pid_283	"I'm supposed to be ""objectively"" happy, but I'm not and I just need something. : To explain a little of my backstory, I'll try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. I used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. I was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. I crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self-harm. I eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i skimped by. I had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor I had. I graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. My first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. See, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. I was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. I eventually moved away and then got a job. I had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self-hatred to a constant need for approval from others. I eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. I started dating a girl i had met online. I decided to go back to school, because I have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significant other. However, I'm not happy. I'm not happy right now, regardless of how well I'm doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family's health are all standard. I'm simply not happy, and i've been disassociating to the point where sometimes i can see myself from a third point of view and I don't know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. I can honestly say that for the first time in a while, I want to die, for no particular reason. I simply wish to... cease existence. But i know i can't just do that. I know how much it would hurt the people i care about. But i don't know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple.

Drinking alone is never good for me but I felt like I really needed to drink. Anyway 2 glasses in I’m trying to find somebody to hang out with, texting all my friends that are nearby and everyone was busy. I felt so lonely, painfully lonely, and I started hating on myself. I’ve learned to really love myself the past few years but lastnight my dark side emerged and I wanted to hurt myself. I took a knife to my leg and just started cutting, something I haven’t done since high school. When I was finished I just looked at it and knew it was a mistake, now I’m going to have to hide it till it heals. No sex, no beach/pool trips, no shorts (the weather is always warm where I live so even though it’s winter these things are still an option for me) ...

However, just recently I found out that they will be transitioning me off to a new therapist. This is mostly because my original one has too many people they have to work on. 
I'll admit that it felt like terrible timing, since we were just looking into possible alternative schools I could do. I met my new therapist as well, and I honestly just don't really like them, or at least feel comfotable. The only problem is they're one of the last ones I can see. I just don't see myself working with them out of being uncomfortable. It kind of feels like everything I've been working up on as kind of been ripped away.

valid_pid_400	"Not feeling enough and wanting to lighten my heart by sharing : Hi reddit, this is going to be one of my first posts so bear with me.
I was feeling blue and didn’t really know what to do except for just lying in my bed, listening to loud music and staring at my laptop screen and feeling empty. 
So I came across this subreddit and after reading some of the posts here I thought that I might feel better to just write a fucking post to get it all out.
I am an anxious person. I love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how I deal with it is to make myself busy with life. School and side activities, part-time jobs and partying. But now that I’ve had extra time I get remembered of demons and all the reasons why I think I am a failure.
First, I get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. I have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and I have seven nieces. I am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since I came into the picture rather late. My relationship with my siblings is non-existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. I also live in another city than them which doesn’t make it easier to get in touch. I feel like I actually don’t know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. I don’t know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. And the thing is I really do want to get closer to them, but I get so anxious around them and I can’t relax. I feel like a personality-less person who doesn’t even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because I have this barrier that won’t let me just be calm and be myself. The only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol doesn’t mix well together. But I love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. But the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that won’t let me leave the bed and I won’t even open my phone for HOURS because I always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though I KNOW that there isn’t anything bad there.
When I’m feeling my worst this anxiety won’t let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one will find me. My mailbox, both email and at home get filled because I have the fear of finding something I won’t like. 
I, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since I don’t have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. I wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school.
But I always tell myself that I’m not enough for anyone and that I am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. But I have had guys showing interest in me, but I get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. And then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it’s for the best because I like being alone anyways. 
Friends. I’ve met a lot of people in my life, but I’m not very good at keeping them in my life. People try to get into my life but I get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. Or when I’m with people I actually do like I get scared that I am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. I get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and I am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they won’t leave the salon. That Is why, if I don’t get invited to one smaller thing or don’t hear of something they all seem to know I take it so fucking personal even though they didn’t even mean to not include me. But since I am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and I start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck I am doing on this planet. I suck at calling people or asking people how they are.
Maybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and I hope that I will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments (if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry!) because anxiety. 
Lots of love from this anxiety filled blob."	moderate
valid_pid_4123	"Am I a horrible person for lying to my roommate? I feel like one... : I got 12 stitches in the bottom of my right foot because I left a box cutter blade on the floor. I bought them when I wasn’t doing well and I swear I never used them. I used coping skills and didn’t cut. I’m almost a full year clean from it. One must’ve fallen on the floor because I stepped on it and cut the bottom of my foot wide open. I didn’t want my roommate to worry about the razor blades so I told her it was a paring knife and that it got thrown away. I also lied about what it was to the nurses because that hospital treated me for my suicide attempt. 
I got help since and I’m doing better. Not suicidal. 
I didn’t want them to think I’d cut myself. I mean, why the hell would I cut the sole of my foot. My right foot?? 
I can’t drive or work or walk without crutches for at least 2 weeks. I kept it a lie because I didn’t want to worry them. But my roommate found the razor blade that had been stuck in my foot in the trash. She must have dug a bit to find it. I tried to explain why I felt I had to lie, but she wouldn’t listen and said that I was now a liar in her eyes and she can’t trust me now. I tried to apologize but she just stormed out of my room.
So I’m just laying in bed pissed off and feeling guilty. I mean, she had to drive me to the hospital to get the stitches.
Part of me is cringing because I should’ve told her the truth. But the other part of me is angry that she wouldn’t even hear me out on why I tried to keep the truth from her. I just wish I could rewind time and stop all this drama from happening.

Then they start to ghost you because you’re the damaged and weird kid and they’d rather not deal that.

The worst part is, I don't even know what to do with myself after leaving. I don't matter to these people yet I'm obsessed with them.

Where waking up is half the battle and getting out of bed is the other. It feels like regardless of how many people are around you telling you they love you, you've never felt so alone. Maybe you think suicide is the way out. I can tell you with 100% honesty that I feel the exact same way. Every day is a fight to answer the question of if my existence means anything to anyone. I ask myself who would care if I died? I fight these demons every day. Hell, it took a week to be able to say any of this here. But, here I stand, fighting this monster with all of you and there's something important you need to know...
It's not your time. 
I've been crying for 7 days in a row thinking about you. Yes, you. The person looking at this and thinking of taking his/her/their own life. And how your life and pain mirrors mine. The facade you put on just to make it through the day. The hellscape that is your brain telling you you're incapable of being loved. That you have no worth or value to anyone in your life. But I want to let you know, you matter to me. Your struggle, your sadness, I see you and you mean something. Not just to me, and stay with me on this one, but to everyone your light (or darkness) has touched. The world needs you to live. You do serve a greater purpose. Not cause god says so. But because somewhere within you, your light is still going. It may be dimmed, it may be clouded, the fog may be thick. But it's there. You can't die yet. I need you. Knowing you exist let's me know I'm not alone. And, as mortifying as it is, we share pain. And the idea of losing you would hurt me more than I already do.

valid_pid_4386	"Not sad or happy about my life but just nothing : I am 25, bilingual, gay(not ugly and above average looking and fit), Asian, nerdy(lived through most of my life being making fun or hated for my eccentricity)
I have no friends, but many acquaintances.(maybe I am putting friends to a very high standard)
I never had any relationship even though I came out 7 years ago to my parents, and being very open about my sexuality.
(I don’t want to share my body to strangers, so I reject all hook up attempts, and I feel that most gay people I met are just insecure, aimless and superficial) 
I am not shy, and I am eloquent and talkative in front of people. I can easily manage social scenes, but I don’t actually care how others think about me.
I was diagnosed with depression since high school for 4 years. I quit the medication few years ago because they are influencing my intelligence(seriously, I am going to work in software development, and I would rather feel shit but have a functioning brain than living in an illusion of relief and happiness caused by drug)
I born from a very conservative family in one of the East Asian countries. I hate my country and escape to US to study and hope to settle here. I have been here 7 years. Now I am getting a master degree in US, and I will be interning at one of the prestigious software company in this summer. (Now, I realize that my hatred to my mother nation is pointless, my suffering is purely due to my unfitness to this world, and nothing to do with policy and culture)
I struggled through the hardest part of my depression by following these tips below.
1.keep a routine and stick to it, no matter how tire how shit you feel. a to-do list such as “I will wash clothes today at xxxx” will help
2.abandon social network, they are toxic to your mental state. I only use it to share information rather than show-off my fake good life or see anyone’s fake good life.
3. Leave toxic people, and YES, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. And give up on people, give up on hoping someone will magically show up and fix all your problems. 
4. A healthy life style is very important to keep you energy level up. Eat good, sleep good, be active.
5. Search on some higher purpose of life. I give up finding any happiness from human connection. I never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, disappoint by people again again and again. Then I stick my interests to machine, I study computer science and I am fascinated by technology. I develop a religious zealous of what a future world I want to create or envisioned: i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. A world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. A world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding.  That’s why my major focus of my computer science degree is artificial intelligence, go figure. The current state of humanity is pathetic, and that is why there are so many depression on this earth.
7.  Then, accept that it’s ok to never feel happy again. But the key to manage a life is not being always happy. I feel that I am more and more in the middle ground: not happy not sad, but just nothing. In these years since I was diagnosed with depression, I find out a single truth. 
Depression can never be gone and it can only be managed.
I gradually accept the fact that I am just a machine,(human body is in fact, just a machine)and I won’t feel the same happiness when I experience the same events like normal people do.  I will feel nothing, but sometime I feel that these kinds of nothingness is a form of tranquility. As long as I am not in constant pain and agony, I am fine with my current state. When people hurt me, I don’t care. When people benefits me, I don’t care. People are too predictable for me, and they are not important anymore. (The only exception is my parents because I feel sorry for them to suffer me)
However, after I live with these mindset for years, I gradually observe that not all people are asshole in nature. Not all people are ignorant. I will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation. (Someone who are supposed to hurt me, do not act upon, or someone who are supposed to benefits me, do not act upon)
Maybe as a person with depression, I can never experiences the joy of “living” with in this world.
But it doesn’t stop you to “live” out of this world, just treat it as a long boring trip on a train with randomly popping in objects of interests. It is not hard at all to get used to this."	severe

valid_pid_305	"Is it normal to have days that are bad after you've overcome depression? : Occasionally, about once in a few months I'll get really depressed, unable to sleep, overthinking and negative thoughts out of no where. I'll tend to think things that are likely not going to happen but I'm just imagining them, crying non stop and mentally hurting myself. Refusing or treating others coldly. I don't wanna ruin any more of my relationships (friends, partners &amp; family).
Is that normal? I've been on antidepressants for almost 1.5years now and I've had my fair share of good days now. I'm functioning again but these bad days out of no where is making me worried if I'll fall back into the deep dark hole.

I tried to get away and go to my room but she just yelled at me to get back and even when I was crying she was just smiling and continuing to yell at me calling me a lazy disgusting maggot. I hate my self so much I really cant cope with this at all. Years of this has just made me more sensitive. I really wanna cut but I cant finds my knife anywhere I'm just gonna kill my self.

valid_pid_1848	"Reality check. : For a large portion of us, we will struggle with this for the rest of our lives. Because no matter how many cocktails they offer, therapists we see, or promises they make, it won't change the fact that we are alone. Not by choice but because of the way our world functions. How many times have you heard ""I need my space."" ""I wore myself out worrying over you."" ""You just don't want to get better."" ""Did you forget to take your medication?"" Yet we are told that ""You have to love yourself."" ""How can you love anyone else if you don't love yourself?"" ""It gets better."" ""You just have to believe."" ""You're not the only one suffering, others have it worse."" It's comedic at this point. 
&amp;nbsp;  
Who can blame them really? Spending your life with someone who has depression is probably not high up on anyone's list. If you find someone who will stay by your side, you have someone most of us will never have. Someone rarer than gold, an exception, not the rule. Cherish them.        
&amp;nbsp; 
The truth is most of us are tired and there's no where to go. No one to turn to who won't put you into a cage while asking you to be happy about it. There's nothing for us. Some of you will find hobbies that keep your mind off of these facets of our shared situations. Some find solace in helping others as they are rotting away inside. Others just retract into an ever expanding black hole. 
&amp;nbsp;
Regardless of our coping mechanisms or the labels they give them, the effects of this disease remain. It itself remains. It takes you apart piece by piece. It wears down the people around you until they can't take it anymore. It leaves us alone, broken apart, fruitlessly trying to piece some semblance of an existence together.         
Is it any wonder why some people choose to check out? A real conversation needs to be had, because people's attitudes towards this disease are not changing for the better. The way they treat people with this disease is not changing for the better. It's all an assembly line to produce something they find palatable. Something they don't need to develop any self-awareness or perspective for. 
No one actually cares about the words on this screen, the person behind them, or the tears that fall onto the keyboard as they are typed. This entire website essentially functions as a social pressure relief valve. Clearly it's not working if the suicide statistics are any indication. I'm tired of pretending all of this is anything but a cruel joke.

valid_pid_4151	"Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) today. Also on Buspar. Could use some insight! : Cross-posted in r/anxiety 
Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) this weekend. Also on Buspar. Could use some input.
After being on Buspar for a few months, it’s helped my anxiety to the point where I don’t really have panic attacks anymore, and my general daily anxiety has subsided a bit. But I’m definitely not 100%. Even though the anxiety is subsiding, I still don’t feel ‘normal.’ In fact, I’ve felt “blank” for years due to anxiety and depression, my baseline is quite low. I don’t really know what it’s like to feel ‘normal’ or 100%. I’m just used to dealing with it day to day. I told my doc all of this the other day while checking how the Buspar was working.
When I look to my future, I don’t really see one. Not because I’m suicidal or anything (thankfully I don’t have those thoughts,) but because it just feels like I’m living day by day without much projection in my life. I go to work, go home, and my social life is really bland for a 24 yr old guy. 
The doc said that Depression is definitely comorbid with my anxiety (you don’t say!) and prescribed be Celexa. I’ve never been on an SSRI, the only med I’ve ever been on regularly has been Buspar. I’m a little nervous to start it, for some reason. I’m supposed to take my first dose this morning. Doc said the only side effect I’ll probably run into is drowsiness. She specifically chose Celexa because apparently it has less severe side effects when compared to Zoloft for a guy my age.

valid_pid_1412	"This world has no place for people like me. : A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.
The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.
Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.
People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.
That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.
The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.
The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.
Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.
I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse."	moderate

I really didn't enjoy any of the 5 years I was there. It was just 'ok'. I really prefer working life. I wish I could relive those years without the same anxiety about money.

Friends and acquaintances seem to only have great recollections about getting pissed, nights out, fucking.

I had very little of that and the thought is bringing me down. I feel like there must be something wrong with me because I am not particularly social.

I'd like to have more friends but I seem to have a hard time making them. In my halls I didn't fit in and I felt like I became the butt of every joke when I left the common room. I could hear a lot of what they said through the walls. The more I heard the more I withdrew.

I saw a psychotherapist (£70 a week!) for a couple of months. He said I didn't realise it, but just by being me I make a lot of people feel insecure. That always sounded like BS to me but it stuck with me anyway.

The older I get the less friends I have as they all move away. I'm married, I met my partner when I was 20. She is always in and out of work which stresses me out, I feel like I am always saving and paying for two people."	moderate

valid_pid_2047	"What a horrible thing for a psychiatrist to say to someone with depression : I have terrible grammar but I will try to express this the best I can.
I have always had a difficult time in school, it's like I lack the ability to study.  I can read the same paragraph 3-4 times and still have no clue what I just read.  In the late 2000s (and my late 30s), I finally got fed up and spoke to my doctor for advise.  He referred me to a psychiatrist and when I sat with her, I explained how much I want to go back to school to better myself but lack the tools to learn.  I told her I contacted a learning center but just the consultation would cost me nearly $1000, I could never imagine having that kind of money.  After explaining all of this to the psychiatrist, she told me I should just accept the person I am and that (and I quote) ""higher learning is not for everyone"" and to stop wasting time or money as this is all I will ever be.
I felt so heart broken and lost and here we are, 12-13 years later, I am still holding on to this.  I completely gave up believing what parents and teachers always told us, ""You can do whatever you put your mind to"".  I became angry at my parents, why mislead people telling them you can do whatever you put your mind to when an ""EXPERT"" basically told me not to thrive for something more.....BUT I have this feeling deep inside of me that I cannot explain...I just want to scream so loud.  I have such a strong desire to be more, to do more with my life.  I hate my job so much, I am so frikkin bored at work all day but I feel like this is all I'll ever be good at.  
One of my closest friends is trying to get me a job interview with her company and she truly believes I will excel at it but I am being self-destructive and it's like I am trying to get her to change her mind and forget about the referral. I tell myself she is just being nice, I will embarrass her, I will fail, they will let me go within a couple months and then I will be completely out of a job.
I really do want this job, it's been such a long time since I have desired something this bad but anxiety and depression keeps getting in the way.

(i’m 15, for context)
no inner thoughts, just made up scenarios and music in my head 
bad hygiene. i make sure that i don’t smell bad while at school and keep my hair clean, but that’s about it 
i bite my nails and the skin around them, this has been going on for as long as i can remember
i eat out of boredom and have gained 40 lbs as a result. i don’t like my body and it holds me back from living my life and doing things, but i never follow through and lose weight.
no care for anything anymore. i used to be the most empathetic and caring person, but i feel desensitized to most things and never worry or care about anything
can’t laugh easily anymore. i used to laugh all the time, at everything. i guess that as you get older that happens, but i literally don’t find anything funny that other people do and i can’t remember the last time i laughed really hard 
i never feel truly happy. if i get something i’ve been looking forward to (a new phone, for example) i’ll be super happy, but that’s it. nothing makes me really think or care. like the coronavirus for example, i just am like “oh, ok”
i always sit around on my phone and do nothing when i could be doing so many other things, but i have no motivation to do them. 
i’m sort of irritable towards my mom at times. i guess that i could be bitter from the names she calls me (asshole, bitch, cunt, fatass, lazy, failure). my mom and i get into bad arguments as as a result, but not often. during those moments when they get really bad, i feel like i don’t wanna be here."	moderate

train_pid_8271	"I’m so empty : I wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. 


I’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. 

I don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore 

Depression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.

Things have been up and down, but despite days where things are good, things also feel highly negative anyway. For example, today I spent 5 hours cleaning my car by hand, polishing, waxing, etc and it felt good to clean it up. As most of you may know, when you get into a slump your environments tend to fall down into a mess with you. So it felt good to tidy it up finally. Despite that, I don't feel accomplished, I don't feel happy, partly stems from finding out my girlfriend had been lying to me for 6 months about her smoking habit, and despite switching to a vape to restart quitting for real this time I still feel extremely stuck on that. Not hate, just another thing contributing to this overall bland feeling that things are just happening around me in life and I'm not really involved in it.
I have good hours at work, my boss is amazingly understanding, I have a family wedding approaching in 3 weeks. Yet all of it I feel increasingly detached from.
It's hard to describe, I don't feel like crying, I don't feel like suicide, I don't feel like self harm, I just feel empty, unattached to anything going on, it doesn't matter if I act in situations because bad things occur anyway like I don't exist in my friendships and relationship, so I feel like if I just stop existing nothing would alter, nobody would be affected, like I was never there in the first place.
I have good days, nothing goes wrong at all, but still I don't feel happy I don't feel good it's just a day where nothing overly bad happened so it's classified as good.
I've lost all motivation to show up to my job, I do the bare minimum to pay my rent and bills then I call sick and I'm ashamed of it, I hate being at home but if I show up to work all that happens is I get a panic attack, crawl into the bathroom and have a breakdown for half an hour and everyone questions it.
I can't even bother to take myself out anywhere, unless it's important I shut any idea I have down and just sit in bed.
All of it just gets hit with ""what's the point ill just be using my time being sad and moody elsewhere so why bother going out""
Just needed a rant really, all my friends I had here in town were workmates who have now quit for university and moved away, the new hires don't speak English and are older, my girlfriend is here but she has her own issues and unloading all my unhappiness on her will just make more issues than it'll help because nobody can fix me, except myself and my own motivation to get out of this rut.

So I’ll just give a little background (theres not much that needs to be said really). I’m a M18 and she’s a F16 and we are about 2 months into our official relationship after talking for about 2 months beforehand. She has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better ______(body part like legs or waist). She has told me about how she’s had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. She has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself (which almost everyone does though idk i just thought I should ad even though thats a different topic entirely). She also tends to have severe anxiety (or something) attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. In an effort to be there for her I’ve tried to do the following things (these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike):

- make it known that I am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she’s feeling down.
- actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. Being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it.
- make sure that when we talk about it I focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings (and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess). Also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something
-making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she didn’t have these thoughts so no random (“how are you feeling” etc...)
- and I’ve told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever!

Now I’d be lying if i said I haven’t messed up with doing/keeping those things (in mind). I have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. I’ve kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. Also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it’s just a really sensitive topic as we all know. 

I was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. Any pointers on what I could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? Is there something im not doing that I should be doing? Is there something im doing that I shouldn’t be doing? I love her a lot and I really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts/feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody’s job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this.

train_pid_5925	Girlfriend just broke up with me. : We've been together for a few months but even still. Depression hots like a bus when you're so used to having another. I really do feel the end of the line, I know I won't because I'm too functional for that.. but in a way that makes me feel worse, I don't know why. I don't even know why I'm posting here. I'm always gonna be the loner I was. No progress has been made I guess.	moderate

valid_pid_82	Someone to talk to : I've been feeling super alone and empty for the past few days, and I just want someone to talk to because I only have one friend in real life and I am not going to constantly bombard her with the depressing shit always running through my head.

valid_pid_3799	"I wrote this to get things off my chest. Now I have to find the strength to actually tell them... : I'm home home alone, wishing you were by my side.
But you're out with him, wishing it was me, so I'm left confused with my head in hands. 
I don't know what's going on, but this path I'm following can't go on.
It's pain, it's pleasure. It's guilt, it's bliss. Are you someone I have, or someone I should miss? 
You say you miss me, and want to be by me, yet I'm left alone, and depression consumes me.
For a moment I feel like I have you, only for you to say ""I'm sorry, I just can't yet""
I know you don't know when, I know you're also confused. I can't hate you, I can't blame you. I gave you away, and that's on me. 
I can't find a clue in what we are becoming, and can't grasp the fact I might have to live without you.
I know I'm being greedy, and its hurting us both, but I'm not ready to give up our possibility.
I'll take this pain, for a little while longer, but idk how much I can keep on without going bonkers.
I drive myself to insane with these thoughts and Hope's. I feel like I'm waiting my turn in a game of jump rope."	not depression
valid_pid_1332	"I hate life right now : Hi,
I'm going through a really rough period and it feels as though everything is getting on top of me. I'm a second-year student studying Computer Science with Games Programming and I'm really struggling.
Right now I have 5 deadlines due in - one in ten days. Luckily I have almost completed the programming for the one in ten days, but I still have to write the report and fix little bits. The rest of them are causing me so much anxiety and stress, and I don't feel like I'm going to pass them at all.
I don't feel like I've learned much at all in my time here, I hate lectures with a passion because just sitting there listening to someone drone on about something when they'd rather not be there does not help me at all, and honestly, I'm just completely burnt out and exhausted. Everything feels like the biggest job in the world - even just sleeping and waking up feels difficult and heavy, nevermind having to code an AI and understand quantum computing.
I've tried to do my own research, get stuff done on time and look after myself during all this but I just can't do it anymore. I'm struggling to remember anything, I barely even remember yesterday. Every day feels the exact same.
Then it comes to placements. I have applied for some placements and thus far have not been accepted for any of them. I have just applied for the final one that I'm actually interested in and am really, really hoping that I get it because I know that I'll be really disadvantaged if I don't get one. Additionally, the placement sounds awesome and I literally cannot do another year of education straight after this one, I'd end up just dropping out.
I think what is really frustrating to me is that all of the placements have expected us to know several things in a great detail of depth which IMO, we haven't been taught. I have tried to look at this stuff online and in books, and just cannot concentrate on it. I'm too burnt out to read and remember the stuff, plus I find learning from books to be just as bad as lectures. The modules which are meant to be teaching us this stuff have either been on strike or have not covered topics in-depth enough to meet the placement's needs.
We have also had lessons canceled due to strikes for months and now the uni is doing all lessons online due to coronavirus - I don't feel like we have been taught much at all and I know that I'm going to struggle with online teaching more than I do in person. For two of my modules, we have just been told to copy and paste stuff and that's it.
My head is just constantly thinking about uni and work over and over and I can't seem to get it to stop.
I just really needed to rant. If anyone has any advice for me or anything then that would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks"	moderate
train_pid_8715	"The happiness mask : howdy everyone!
I wanted to touch on an interesting subject for me.
First of all I am an 11th grader and I have been suffering from severe depression and ocd/anxiety since the 8th grade...and yes I go to a psychiatrist I haven't diagnosed myself on my own.
I take 3 kinds of meds with relatively high doses, but I don't want to discuss that I want to talk about something else!
My life isn't the brightest in the first place, but it got worse a month ago. My father passed away at the age of 63...and he was a cancer patient.
From all the horrible experiences in my life so far I still believe I haven't seen anything yet. Let alone the dark and suicidal thoughts that I have from my depression. 
So my question is...I Am turning into such a happy and optimistic person and all this suffering has turned me into a much more mature person. I like to think I am more mature than most teens at my age.
Someone told me that people like to give what they don't have. Like if I don't have a happy life, it would make me much happier if I made someone Happy.
And it wasn't till recently that I found out that it's true!
So it's not like I am pretending to be happy in front of people. It's not a happiness mask it's just that I love being positive to people because that makes ME positive as well!
So don't think of your depression as a handicap think of it as a way to get more mature and experience life.
Plus a successful person with depression is way stronger than a successful one without something dragging them down!
So stay strong and keep fighting guys I know how it is to feel lost, lonely, not knowing who you are, not knowing if you're worth it, not knowing if anyone loves you. But in the end you should matter to yourself. I know you might hate yourself but you have to love yourself and care for yourself. Your mental health is important and don't feel hesitant to ask for help, especially professional help!
These are just some thoughts that have been roaming my mind lately!
Please tell me your opinion on this subject and I hope I brightened up your day and you're definitely not alone in this world. Take it from a depression patient.
Anyways I hope you have a wonderful day!
PS I forgot to mention that you're never gonna be always happy but you should keep fighting for happiness"	severe
train_pid_8665	"Forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. Realizing this might just help me : Before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there  is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. But when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. As if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and discard the old busy life. As for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations  I've had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. I could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. ""You got some of them dark jokes"" ""somthing you probably can help me with etc"".   
I guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place.  
So when I'm depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago- Despite the self hatred and despair. In that way, it might just help me. I sound like a therapist talking to a depressed 13 yo, i know. But i sorta hope this is uplifting.  
But I wanna add the fact that I'm 18, and I've had depression 3 times in my life. And maybe I have yet to discover what real depression is, or haven't lived long enough to actually state this as matter of fact"	severe

valid_pid_2204	I wanna die : Sometimes I have some episodes like right now where I'm just...depressed and I don't wanna do anything and my bf asks me why I'm like this and it's just a mood... I kinda like being in it, it's comfortable but at the same time I'd like to get on with my life but I'm just so discouraged... I hate myself, my friend asked one thing of me and I wasn't responsible enough to do it and there might be consequences... I know she's frustrated and I can't handle when someone is mad at me...

train_pid_1731	Im feeling down : I’ve struggled with depression in the past and I’ve thought that (with the help of therapists) that I’ve gotten better with it.  But I feel like I’m stuck in the spot where I started 4 years ago. I’ve built up relationships and friendships witch seems to help a lot but whenever I’m alone I feel like I felt a long time ago.

valid_pid_120	Corona cured my depression? : I had a terrible depression the last weeks because my life was becoming a mess and I didn't feel like I didn't contribute anything to the world. Right now my entire country is in a lockdown because of corona virus and everyone's life is a mess. Colleges and universities are closed and all events are cancelled. I don't feel worthless anymore for sitting at home doing nothing because that's what's the entire country is doing until April 1st at least. This might sound strange or selfish but corona has done good things for my mental health. Thanks, I guess? Even though it's a terrible virus and I hope it will be gone soon for the sake of mankind.	moderate

valid_pid_3563	"Long time lurker and this seems like the best place to vent because I daren't open up to anybody I know : Sorry for the long post btw.
- I work a fucking shit job that I hate for minimum wage with no option for over time 
- over the last 8 months I've applied for jobs and only had one interview for  which I ended up being rejected 
- I tried to get a car to help me get a better job which I barely used for 2 months before it completely died and ended being just over £1000 out of pocket leaving me struggling for money and not being any closer to getting a car or having any savings 
- I constantly feel anxious to the point where I feel sick 
- all my friends seem to flourishing in life and leaving me behind
- I've become bulimic again just to help deal with the stress and anxiety 
- and I havent slept properly since I came home from travelling in May. 
I've tried for far too long to be positive but now I'm just so fucking fed up of life and everything shitting on me, I am just so apathetic towards everything and want it all to stop and just give me a fucking break. I got a new game I pre ordered and was excited for today and I can't even bring myself to enoy it that now.

Honestly, it was like a sudden downpour on a sunny day-- scrolling on reddit, feeling ""okay"" then suddenly sobbing, struggling to breathe and wanting to just....end. 
My poor pup was snuggled next to me and didnt seem like he knew what to do. He wiggled closer, licked at my face and let me wrap myself around him and break down. The crying has stopped, but the mental fog has firmly settled in and I'm exhausted.
My pup is good-- happy snuggling, cuddly, but I feel awful for freaking him out with my break down."	not depression
