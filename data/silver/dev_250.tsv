dev_pid_1	"I enjoyed today, and I still am! Tomorrows depression can wait! : Today, I'm warm and cozy :) I even had some tea, to complement my sandwich!
This is a crazy time we live in, but it's only the beginning, with the world going to shambles, being alone feels werid.
But a stranger came through and saved me,
Of course it's a debt I'll have to repay, but I'm grateful to have this debt!
Crazy what a few dollars can do to change someones situation.
But these days, it's all about here and now!
I don't have the ability to relax just because, I'm full, clean, and warm.
Tomorrow it's back to reality! 
The motel was just to get ourself together! We been out here panicking the past two weeks and the last 3 days exspecially.
I got blessed this week that's for sure!
Two weeks till payday.
What to do, what to do.
Well I can't just pull another loan, so I gotta make what's left it last. 
Planet fitness anyone???!! 
Okay actually, gas wise, idk, finding safe places to park for extended periods of time, it's werid. You'd be surprised how much you stand out during everyone panicking staying at home at night.
Yet I also kinda like it. 
This motel would be $500 bucks for two weeks, maybe I can scrap the car for the room.
You know I remember back when I still had savings $500 was like not a big deal. Don't get me wrong $500 ain't nothing to sneeze at, but that was back in like June.
I'm seriously considering scraping the car, for that guarantee place to stay.
I can always save up 2-3 months and get another one...
Idk,
Today, I'm actually less sad.
But I guess this is the first time in like two weeks I could really analyze my situation, with rational thought.
Anyhow, tomorrow!!!!!!! We gotta get back on the hunt, maybe find some random gig, and I'd like to pay back that loan back early.
Easier to do work when you can eat!

dev_pid_2	"I sorta tried to kill myself : I had a total breakdown in a fucking car park at 1am alone.i sat for balling my eye out for hours covered in blood and swallowed 32 pill. I'm in a little pain but I'm home now I've calmed down and I'm feeling a bit more relaxed. I've been so alone look lately, the only person who I can ""talk to"" is my ex who cheated, lied and often avoids me. I tried calling samaritans when I was outside however they waiting list was so long. I was planning on kept the pills and saving more up. I know I'm going to do it eventually, im almost 20 and I have absolutely nothing to live for, all my time being alive and I've nothing to show for. Just an ever growing list of failures. I hate fucking feeling like this, I just wish this wasn't my fuckicn life. I can't take it"	moderate

dev_pid_4	"a story : I remember the time I'd get on my 3DS to play Nintendogs. I'd be at my grandparents house, having fun with my chihuahua. It was nice and calming, having no trouble when I need to get in a safe space. Peaceful music was played whenever I'd walk my dog. Competitive, yet smooth music played whenever I'd enter competitions. A fun experience was the least I could say. It was amazing.
I had a dog once. Well, not exactly my dog, it was my grandparents. We called him Bugsy (Bugzy?) and he was the best goddamn dog I knew. One day, my sisters and I were driving on a highway, when all of a sudden we heard a thud. We suddenly lost control of the vehicle, and we were forced to stop. When we collectively shit ourselves from what the hell just happened, my sister opened her door and went out to inspect what we hit.
It was Bugsy. A few weeks before, he ran away. I wasn't sure why he did, he was living a perfectly comfortable life. Perhaps he was seeking adventure? Nonetheless, we killed him. We ran him over because we didn't see him coming. We weren't expecting this to happen. We cried. We didn't know what to do with the body. She quietly put the carcass on the side of the road, as to not be ran over by others.
A while later, I got a 3DS and my first game: Nintendogs. And unfortunately, it reminded me of Bugsy. I wish I could have done more for that dog. I truly miss him. I would take care of him as much as I have taken care of that dog in the 3DS. I feel like an asshole when I say that, because it's ultimately true. I never played with Bugsy that often, but I still feel like I'm missing out when I think of him."	moderate
dev_pid_5	"The world only cares about beautiful people : I'm born ugly. I've always been ugly all my life and I don't think that I could ever become more beautiful. However, I used to think that if I tried my best and be a ""good"" person, people will like me too. But I'll never be treated like those who are beautiful. No matter how much I tried to become a excellent student, a helpful friend, others never really like me, no one cares about my existence. I have no real friends and I have never been in a relationship. In contrast, those beautiful people never have to try. They instantly become the center of attention, have a lot of friends and be successful in life. 
It's hard to accept that all my efforts would go in vain just because of my ugliness, something that is not even my fault. People usually say: "" Not only is he/she good looking but he/she is also nice"". Nah, you're wrong. They are nice because they are beautiful, they are nice because others treat them well and they don't have to suffer all the difficulties as us ugly do everyday."	moderate
dev_pid_6	"I try to be social. Guess what fucking happens. : No one wants to talk to me.
This is such fucking bullshit.  I make myself available, nobody wants to fucking talk with me or hang out with me.  Before any one of you comes at me with the ""you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"", I've fucking tried that shit.  I've tried it for three goddamn decades and here's what it's gotten me:
-the complete and total lack of ability to create serotonin
-a shitty, abusive wife who said she would file the divorce papers in OCTOBER if ""I had no intention of reconciliation.""  Fuck you, dude, that's all I fucking DID was work to make YOU happy and sacrifice my own Goddamned mental wellbeing because I wanted to make YOU feel like you were worth something.  The least you could fucking do would be to file the goddamned paperwork.  Shouldn't be too fucking hard for you to do, since you decided to not even COME DOWN TO VISIT ME after our wedding.  So yeah.  Last day I fucking saw your ungrateful face was 5/20/17.
-The inability to feel anything other than complete and utter hatred 90% of the time
The only thing that's kept me happy is the meager social media interaction I have but even now that's starting to dwindle because people keep moving on.
People spend all of five minutes with me and ""oh, I'm too busy"" etc.
FUCK THAT YOU CAN TAKE TEN MINUTES OUT OF YOUR DAY AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME INSTEAD OF IGNORING ME.
I wish I had been born prettier.
Maybe then people would love me."	moderate
dev_pid_7	"I don't deserve love or affection. : I honestly am starting to believe I am going to die alone. I have never been good at establishing meaningful relationships with anyone, including my family. I have always felt like an outsider in every situation I've been in. I can't even make friends that ever become much more than acquaintances I see from time to time. Not once have I had what I could consider a best friend and dating has never been much better.
I have only dated three women, whom I was with long enough for us to meet each other's family. The longest of which was almost ten years and it ended in divorce. I have never been one to feel comfortable in my own skin and going out in public fills me with anxiety. I never participated in any sort of hook-up culture and it's been a little over two years since I had any sort of intimate contact with another person. I am miserably lonely and feel like there is just not a single person out there for me.
I've seen similar posts from people talking about the lack of intimacy in their own lives and how it takes a toll. I feel dead inside and really do not believe I am in any way adequate enough to make another person happy. With all the other stress in my life due to a complete lack of direction, little to no motivation, and an overall sense of existential dread, I doubt I am even in any condition to maintain a romantic relationship. I am miserable and that will only destroy anything I attempt to build.
I can't even remember what it is like to truly have feelings for someone, to be excited about the prospect of spending time with them, the joy of having someone in my life. I don't feel like it will ever happen again and if it does, I will probably just ruin it. At this point, things like getting married again, having kids, starting a family, buying a house, etc. none of those things appeal to me. I have absolutely no interest in them. I see no future for myself where I actually have a sense of self-worth or even the faintest sense of identity.
I just work and that is it. I try to get involved with a few things or groups, but nothing really makes me happy. I haven't got anything to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. Even getting a cat leaves me feeling empty. I see the weekend approaching and I know I will end up spending my evenings home alone with no one to talk to. It has always been like this, before and after my failed marriage.
In spite of the things my ex-wife did wrong, I feel more and more that I was the one to blame and that I simply do not deserve anything good in my life. I can't find it when I go looking for it and it doesn't seem to fall into place on its own. It's now less a question of IF and more a matter of WHEN. I am so tired of all this constant sameness. I just want it over."	moderate
dev_pid_8	"What am i? : I'm super depressed i guess, i don't want to go out, I don't want to talk to anyone, everything stresses me, I've done things i regret ever knowing or doing. Like I don't want this knowledge. I dont want to know anything. I want a easy life, and i dont have one, sometimes i feel like im in autopilot, when i feel lifeless, like when i dont feel anything, when i feel numb and so over with life, i dont want this life, is so complicated, so full o assholes and dark shit i dont want to be part of, i feel so tired. I guess one of the ways i cope is being isolated, but is not, it just makes this dark entity, it feeds through my isolation, my loneliness, my weaknesses, my stress, and when its full it explodes and it overpowers me. Im weak i feel useless, i dont have any aspiration, all my aspirations and goals are fake, they are not real thats not me. I dont have a me, i dont feel like i exist, i feel like this is not me, i dont know who is me i just know that when im not doing something everyone expects from me im not me, i just dont know who am i. The only thing i guess im sure of is that i have hope, just hope and want to live life, experience things, i want to know the secrets of the world, i want to know the unknown. I know i dont belong nowhere, like i have parents and siblings and a friend nut i dont feel a connection like i dont feel love, am i going crazy? i feel things but i dont know what they are i dont know sometimes. Like i care for them if they were ever in any kind of danger or pain and would give my life for my loved ones but in a regular day i feel like doing nothing like i fell nothing, im always distracting myself and doing stuff im good at i guess. I know im driving my loved ones away from myself but i know is best, they are better knowing im just an emo heartless bitch who doesn't care about anything, thats a selfish and has no future they are better of knowing all those things than my true self which is nothing im just no one with a job to carry on the life of this physical body. I dont know whats happening, i used to be different i used to be the opposite of what i am now, well i guess i was still a bitch but with more positive qualities than the bad ones im portraying right now.
ps: Im not gonna kill myself, and im here bc i dont have the resource to seek professional help."	moderate
dev_pid_9	Help : I don’t know what to do. I cant survive the rest of this school year. I hate going and it is ruining my life. It is causing me major depression. I want to kill myself. I don’t really want to die I just want school to end. Please. I don’t know what to do. I am too afraid too tell anyone about it. I won’t survive 4 more years of school. Why does the school system and anyone involved in it hate kids so much. I don’t know how much more of this fucking hell i can mentally handle before I decide to kill myself. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life and I don’t want to die. I just can’t stand school anymore. Every single thing about it is horrible. There is nothing good about it. I hate it. I hope my school gets bombed or shot up. I cant handle this shit anymore.	moderate
dev_pid_10	things aren’t getting any better : i’ve done what people told me to do and leave the lives of those who really didn’t care about me. but, now i’m alone. i have no one. truly i have no one. my heart aches from this silence in my body that no one understands. video games aren’t fun anymore. i can’t go out bc i think too much. memes don’t make me laugh. i just go to school and act like everything is okay, but it’s not. it’s not and i hate the fact that it isn’t. i go to school bc it’s the only time in my life that i have people to be with, but after that, i’m just a side character. no one cares, truly i can say that with confidence. im losing reasons to get out of bed everyday that passes, i’ve never been one to consider even hurting myself. but i just can’t stop thinking about why me, out of all people that could have been here, was it me? why was i put on this earth, i don’t feel like i even have a purpose. i feel im just, here. im not happy, not sad, just, here. it breaks my heart little by little even thinking that, if this doesn’t stop, my parents, siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, are probably never gonna see me again. i don’t know what to do. seconds feel like minutes, minutes feel like hours, etc. i try to escape in any way i can, but i just can’t, even working and putting money in my pocket isn’t doing a thing, i don’t wanna turn to drugs, bc ruining my life is a fate worse than death. i just feel like i’m in a hole, with no one watching. waiting for an inevitable death.	moderate

After that experience I felt completely sad and empty. A week later I decided to do it again but under different circumstances (people I was completely comfortable with, didn’t have to go home, etc) and it was the same thing. It made me realize how depressed I was and now I cant get out of my depression. I just feel like I’m just watching everyone live and I’m just stuck in my head.

dev_pid_17	"I will kill myself : I joined this subbreddit because for the first time of my life i found people with similar families to me. I am the usual i guess, divorced parents that still hate each other after years of their break-up, but this just goes beyond everything i would have ever imagined. I used to live with my mother and it was hell, no better word to describe it. She used to insult me just for being, calling me a usseles son and an autistic no-one, constantly trying to make fun of me and shame me for everything she could, this went on for a couple years, around 2 or so, until finally some months back i snapped, i just couldn't take it anymore. She started yelling at me for some stupid reason and i just tried to ignore her, but she entered my room and started just trowhing everything she could. My lap-top, my ps4, my phone, everything she could grab and throw into the wall was thrown. I just wasnt dealing with it anymore, the sadness just was pure madness at that point, i grabbed her and pushed her out of my room while she screamed at me full pshyco. I closed the door and hold it close while she tried to smash it down to get back in my room. She started crying and shouting to me things that i cant quite remember, at this point i was just pushing the door shut while crying. The moment was over-whelming, i tried my best to stay as stable as possible but i just felt so much anger and fear at the time. An hour later or so, my father showed up at my house and make me grab my stuff and leave. On the way to his apartment, he only stayed silent while looking at me, and i just tried my best to calm myself. When we arrived, he talked to me, he ask why did i did that and if i was okey with what i did. Soon i understood what he meant,my mother had called him telling him that i had hitt her and that i was just violent against women. My father never talked to me again about that, but afther that day things started to go down-fall.
I started going to the psychologist after that, my mother signed me up and made my father take me every week for about a month. There the stupid bitch talked to me about things like ""you should feel angry with women"" or ""hitting women is not okay"". I hated going, i hated going every week to be treated like a criminal, like if i was the one that needed help. After that i started living with my father, since my mother kicked my out of my house i had no where else to go. My room now is a little bed next to where he works. (He is a lawyer).
A month or so starting to get used to living with him i was just broken. I went from hanging out with friends every day and every night to stay away from home as much as possible to stay inside every-day whit my ps4, eating and doing as much as i could to avoid my friends, since they had no idea nor i have ever told them why i just stopped hanging out with them.
Since then my life has been a total disaster i dont want to try to fix anymore. I tried my best to go back to the person that i used to be, but every day its more and more difficult. I was just a normal kid, a 16 year old that would play ps4 and hang around with friends during the week and go partying some saturdays. Now im just a sad fucker, i still hang around with friends but i just dont feel the same anymore, i used to be the one that made everyone laughed and now im just the one that stays behind silent and laughs a little every now and then. My friends have noticed this but every time someone asks me ""is everything okay?"" Or ""are u fine?"" I just do my best to keep them away, what am i suppoused to say? That my mother is a psycho that kicked me out and my father beats me everythime he gets mad at me? I feel so ashamed, i feel so sad and angry, and i have to put all of that behind a mask of ""na bro, im fine, just sleepy"" and pretend im alright.
Like i said, my father gets angry at me for almost no reason, he hates that i play ps4, he hates that i go partying even tough he knows that i have always been really mature with the alchochol and that i have never ever had problems with it. There are nights where he just arrives from the job and sitts next to me, just to give me a large speech of how pathetic i am and how i will always be alone for the kind of person that i am, how no one will ever love me and how i will be left alone once he kicks me out of the house. I just do my best to cry as silently as possible, pretending that i dont care.
All this happened in the summer, so when i had to come back school (i am from Argentina) i had to face my mother again. At my school, wich is the only thing i really care, you have to sitt for an exam to enter another year. This exam is really easy and i have always been a good student so it hasnt ever meant a real deal to me, but this year was different. My mother called my father and told him that if i didnt passed this exam she would make sure that i got kicked out of school, so my father made me stay home for two hole weeks ""studying"" while my mother called him every few hours to ""check on me"". I passed this exam with a 10 (A+ i guess) but those weeks were a nightmare, my father was all day yelling at me to keep studying and to focus or i would go to another shitty school. Those nights were when all the reason why i write this began, the suicidal thoughts
Every night since those nights i cant avoid but think about how tired i am, how much i want to die and i really mean it. Every day i arrive home knowing that mu father will look at me into my eyes and give me that disaproving stare he always gives me. Every night i feel the door opening i drop my phone and pretend to be asleep so he doesnt talks to me. His words are knives into my very soul, i cant have peace anymore. Every time i look myself into the mirror i see everything that my father described, everytime i have time to think i just hear his words repeating themselves again and again, remembering me what i am and how little i deserve from others
I had dreams of being a doctor, i dreamed of finishing the book i was writing and i dreamed of getting to know someone else. Watching my ex next holding hands with another dude was like a bullet on a dead-body. It hurt, it really did, but at the time i was so fucked up that it meant nothing to me. Of course she gets to know someone new, she arrives home with a lovely mother and a care father that both treat her with respect and love. If i didnt had parents that hatted me i would be even better than her, but i am not, i am just a sad fuck that ""can't get over it"" and she gets to laugh with her friends about me every time she sees me.
Last-night was when i snapped again. My father came to me while i was having dinner alone and he told me that he doesnt want me to be with him anymore. He says that i dont help around the house and that i am just wasting his money and his time. He told me that he is going to send me back with my mother and that i dont get to decide if i wnat it or not.
I dont want to go, but i dont want to stay neither. My father does and did horribles things to me, but my mother is just hell to me, i cant deal with it anymore, i wont
I want to kill myself, i want to get up right now from the bed and sneek trough his bedroom, i want to go to the roof and jump. Im crying and i cant sleep because i know that deep down i really want to do it. I want help, i just want to hear someone, i dont want to do it even tought it seems the only thing to do. Please, i dont want to go to a psychologist and be treated like a criminal again. I know that my father wont care if i tell him how i feel, he will just get even more angry at me. I cant go back to my mother, i start shaking just of thinking of it. I need help, i need a way out of this no matter what."	moderate
dev_pid_18	"Tired : It grows, the void, engulfing me in its darkness. Anxious, mind racing, unable to sleep. Crying has become a normal thing, no one notices. I can’t breathe I’m slowly suffocating on emotions. They swallow me whole. Every possible scenario runs through my head, constantly churning. When did I become this pitiful? When did my laughter turn to sobs? I can’t even remember happiness anymore, just this empty feeling, this pit of loneliness. When I’m with people I’m still completely alone, detached. I’m scared, scared of what this means. Scared that my life will just progressively tumble in the direction it’s heading. Down. I feel like I’m falling, the thought of hitting the ground terrifies me, but I just keep falling into emptiness. The ground never shows itself, will someone be there when I hit? Doubtful. It’s like I’m falling from space; will there be anything left by the time I reach the ground or will I burn up and disappear. 
I try, really hard, to change my perception, to look on the brighter side, but I’m always pushed/pulled back to this space. This mindset. I’m tired of faking it. I’m tired of being forgotten. I’m tired of watching people slowly distance themselves from me. I’m tired of always feeling alone. I’m tired of failing. I’m tired of trying. I’m tired of falling. I’m just tired."	moderate

Last year I decided  I’d hold off on killing my self and try one more year, make it to 21 at least. Told myself I’d either get it together in that time or end it.

I talk to 2 people on a regular basis, both of them are toxic in one way or another; my body is constantly in pain, and I'm not even an adult yet; I'm on antidepressants that barely work, go to therapy twice a month, and yet I still can't find happiness for more than 5 minutes; I don't do anything successfully, I always fuck everything up. I know it's a selfish thing to do, but I can't think of anything else that would help. The very worst thing is that I don't even have a reason to be this fucked up, my family is fine, I have a roof over my head, food to eat, I'm just fucking weak. God, I'm so sorry that this world has had to put up with me for so long. It'll be better without me. Bye.	moderate
dev_pid_31	Hope someone can hear me out here : I feel more and more sad everyday. It's like things are getting darker and darker. I constantly have nightmares, I'm always tired and I always fear that people will hate me. Sometimes I wish I got into an accident and died, so I would no longer be a burden for people.	moderate
dev_pid_32	"Girl I loved and loved me back for a short while basically kicked me to the curb and showed she didn't give two shits about me. She was everything to me and I was nothing to her. I don't have anyone and don't know how much longer I can go on. : I would've done anything for this girl, she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, her eyes were big and full of life and always had a shine in them and were worthing looking into for eternity, her smile was tiny but I would do anything to see it one more time, she had long beautiful brown hair that accentuated her pretty face. I would tell her this everyday when we started talking, and then one day she lost complete interest, she stopped messaging me as much, and then the next day came and the next, and we stopped talking completely. She told me she loved me back, she told me she liked me, and then today she didn't give two shits about how I felt. How can someone you love be so cruel.
I feel like I'll never meet anyone as beautiful and caring as her, I'll never find someone I love as much as I love her, I don't know what the point in even staying alive is. Before I met her I was looking into buying a gun, now I think I might continue that plan."	moderate

dev_pid_34	I feel like I ruin everything that I touch and interact with. : When I know I’m doing good at something or I did something good  I still feel sad or like a disappointment to the people around me especially to my parents.People I know think of me as the person that is always joking and playing around in a funny way but I’ve never told anybody how I really feel inside .I hope one day I won’t feel like this. Some times I feel like people would be better off without me but I try not to think like that.	moderate
dev_pid_35	"I honestly think the world would be better off without me. I just want to die. I want the pain to end. : My life just keeps spiraling. I feel so alone. I am alone. I feel so used and hurt. I’m only good enough for people when they can take something from me or use me but are never around when I try so hard to reach out for them or ask for help. I open up to people I feel I can trust after a long time and they always leave. They always distance themselves. They always show less and less and less interest in me until they ignore my texts or avoid me at work or do what they can to be away from me. It’s like I have some sort of infectious disease and they don’t want to catch it. 
No one ever takes my emotions seriously. I try to explain I’m depressed or that I want to kill myself or I’m hurting so bad and I’m ignored or my feelings are made invalid or I’m told “you’re too pretty to be depressed,” like my appearance has anything to do with how I feel on the inside. 
I’m a disappointment to my family. I never seem to do right by them. I’m always fucking things up or doing things they don’t like and ruining everything. I ruin a lot of things for a lot of people it seems, and I ruin things at work. I’m struggling meeting my quotas. No one seems to notice that something is wrong. I’m just told to bring my numbers up and smile. No one wants to listen to what I say. 
I’ve relapsed. I’ve been starving myself again, and I’ve been cutting. But I’m scared of myself. Because the cutting and the starving isn’t enough anymore. I want to do more to hurt myself and I worry I’ll kill myself. I want to kill myself. But I don’t want anyone to clean up the mess. I don’t want the last thing I do to be just another burden for someone else. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want the pain to stop. I want everything to stop. I want to be numb. I want to die."	moderate

I had plans to go out tonight all week, but it wasn’t confirmed so she asked if she could use my id to get into bars (I know this is illegal, please don’t judge us, I don’t feel comfortable doing it but she guilts me into it sometimes). I told her that I wasn’t sure yet and that I would have plans tonight. My plans confirmed and she basically said fuck it and bullied me into giving her my id and then she just left. We argued a lot and I sorta just gave up and gave it to her. Now I’m home alone crying. She is so incredibly selfish, like what she is doing is not only illegal she robbed me of something I was looking forward to. My spring break trip, classes, and retreat got canceled bc of corona and i spent 2 months in a cast this year bc I broke my ankle. Basically I haven’t had fun in a very long time. I was really looking forward to hanging out with my friends and she just took it away from me. Why does nothing work out my way. I know I’m not the only who’s plans got affected because of corona, but I still deserve to be in control of the things I have control over.	moderate

dev_pid_43	"I cant hide from myself : It comes and goes with the seasons so i at least get a little taste of reality before becoming lost in my mind again. I have matured and my beliefs have changed but depression is emotional and so it is hard to rationalize with. I used to be sad that i havent had sex and im 19 now. But honestly its not a big deal, at least not to me and if someone else decides otherwise, fuck them its my life. My depression isnt really based on thought processes as much anymore its just a deep feeling of loneliness. 
It drove me to a massive drug binge with lots of acid every week for about a year and a half, then a short but intense benzo binge. Acid probably taught me a lot that i take for granted, but i know it taught me one thing, i cant answer these questions with anything that quick. It will always be a slow, painful and confusing process with some beautiful moments.
The benzos stop me from feeling for months. I dont remember a lot of it. During my first semester of college i was almost entirely unconscious. I was effectively the living dead. And then i almost died for good. My friend told me my heart had stopped briefly. But came back as the drugs wore off in time for me to survive.
Since then i cant explain it but ive changed drastically, in some good ways in some bad. I feel as though i did die and this is the new life i am living. And i often have a sensation that a part of me is still in the ""other world"", again hard to explain. But to be frank i saw nothing, just a peaceful unconsciousness. But if theres one thing ive learned, its that no tiny brained human such as me could ever truly understand the nature of life and death, so im gonna stop right their and let mystery be mystery.
The depression is coming back even though i am different now. Its become blatantly obvious to me that these things ive felt for so long cant be solved with things on the outside. Not even the embrace of a lover. I have spent so much time chasing a dream because reality was never enough. 
In the end i cant hide from myself or my nature, for it is what shapes my existence. And as far as i can tell death is the ultimate darkness. For that reason i no longer believe death is better than life. And ive realized its better to experience pain than nothing. You dont get what you want. And you dont know what you need until you've found it. I hope i find that one day."	moderate

dev_pid_45	"A bad week : I woke up on Sunday on hives that progressively got worse and have been coming and going. When I went to the doctor, they just told me to take allergy pills because it looks like it's from contact and should go away. The hives have still been flaring up and disappearing, and its usually covers at least one set of limbs, if not my entire body, including my face.
I've been having a more depressed week than usual, and I'm currently crying for no reason, and haven't been able to dig up any motivation to do school work, or anything in general, and I think I'm on the verge of failing my classes. 
I applied for a position that's a step up from my current position, and even for internal candidates, we're required to go through the hiring process again, and I went into my interview today, and kept getting called out for being off topic, for not actively listening (I asked what their names were at the end of the interview because I don't remember them introducing themselves at all), and I'm worried that I failed this interview, which means that I won't get the new job which is fine, but I'm worried that because I didn't so well on the interview, I'll be fired from my current job as well.
I'm currently in bed, crying and wondering why I'm alive, and why I didn't kill myself last year, when I was so damn close. Instead, I reached out for help, only to be abandoned by counsellors, psychiatrists and organizations that I've been connected because they feel like I'm doing well enough to not need their resources."	moderate

I've been through verbal and physical abuse. I've been through shitty situations (if you don't count my life as one big shitty situation already). And lastly, I've been through a loss of a friend. She might've killed herself, but I don't know if it actually happened. She just told me about her planning another suicide attempt one day, and suddenly cut all ties another day. This was my biggest loss yet.  
I hate when people tell me to vent.  
Everytime I tell someone about my problems, my feelings, my past, I fucking hate myself. It feels like I relive every situation I tell people about. It hurts. This is the worst thing you can tell me. No kinds of insults, bullying or even abuse can do so much damage to me.

I know I still have it and will most likely have it again at some point In my life. Today though it doesn’t affect me as much. Today I feel more good than bad. 
It’s not simple and it’s not easy. Today I asked someone to hang out. They said yes. They followed through. We swam for 45 minutes till we were out of breath. Then went out for drinks and dinner. We talked and had some laughs. I came home feeling fulfilled and more like myself

After a couple of days my high school sweetheart (that I never expressed my feelings) texted, saying that we lost contact and proposed that we should go for a glass of wine. Me being the stupid bloody idiot that I am accepted without thinking. Having arrived at the wine bar and having drank the first bottle, we talked endlessly, recapping the last 6-7 years old our lives, and eventually reaching the point in the conversation about our love life. We talked and then I thought it would be a good idea to express my feelings. It was not a bloody good idea. She rejected me by saying “ hah you? First of all you’re fat!” And bloody hell at that moment I wished for the floor to open up and swallow me. So I pretended there was a work emergency, paid for the wine and fled like a little bloody cunt. It’s been 2 days since that happened. I haven’t been sober after that.

I’ve been feeling so stuck and empty and my mind just keeps being negative. My depression has become even more overwhelming than before.
I had a fighting spirit back then, but now that I’m older I’ve gotten so weak. I can’t focus and I know it’s all my fault. All the decisions I’ve made were because of me. I don’t blame anyone else. I’m aware of my faults.
Idk maybe I’ve reached my limit and I hate it. I’ve endured so much before (bullying, harassment..), so why cant I face something like this anymore. The person I hate the most is myself right now. 
My sister says I’m being over dramatic and I know I’m probably making a mountain out of a mole hill but i feel I’ve lost control of my brain, my heart, my body and my life. Everything I thought I knew about myself, it’s all gone. I try explaining it to her, but it’s so hard to formulate the right words to express the chaos in my head. Every time I talk to her she turns it around and says people have it worse. I always end up feeling like a loser and a weakling. I realized soon enough that she’ll never understand me, so I don’t talk to her about my issues anymore. I can’t talk to my parents because they think depression is a choice. I can’t talk to my friends because i don’t want to burden them. All I can do is keep this to myself and it’s been so difficult. I keep a knife in my dresser now, it’s like I’ll never be happy and probably ending my life would be a blessing....so I won’t cause my family anymore trouble with my failures.
I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t know if I’ll have anywhere to go from here on out.

Only about a week later, I get a message from this girl I’d been talking to for over a year at this point, saying she’s leaving the university and that basically I’ll never see her again.  For another two weeks I sit and just wonder what to do that won’t collapse around me.  Then, as soon as I feel myself starting to climb back out of this hell I’ve found myself in, coronavirus hits, cancelling March Madness, baseball for the time being, and many other things I had been looking forward to for a long time.  Oh, and now my school is proceeding with online classes making it essentially impossible for me to adequately learn in a way that actually works for me.  And then, just now, I get another message from the same girl from earlier telling me that she has a bf that she wants to break up with, meaning I have been stuck in the friend zone this entire time. So basically, tl;dr, Life is beating me down and most, if not all, of it is completely beyond my control. I feel helpless.

I’ve tried to think about all the good times and honestly it doesn’t help it usually makes me feel worse. I feel like most of tropes that people say just don’t help. I read about someone quoting “It has been said that time heals all wounds. I don't agree. The wounds remain. Time - the mind, protecting its sanity - covers them with some scar tissue and the pain lessens, but it is never gone.”

So I decided about 1 year ago that if I cant feel happy or stop feeling numb before I finish my goal of to have a house and 2 cars, and all the debts I owe are paid before I can really enjoy life then ifs game over, it's funny to think I set these goals in order to concentrate on in order to move forward with a distraction. But it's kinda crazy how much you can accomplish in a year.
The reason I came up with this route is to better myself, and if I got back to the old me.  I could just keep walking like nothing happened. The main reason I did this is because I'm tired at 20,  I will be even more tired at 21. I don't want one thing to just make me say that one small thing hurt me now I'm done cause i think that would be dumb of me.

dev_pid_66	Depression is real. : I grew up in a super restrictive religion. Finally broke free at the age of 25. At the same time my wife left me. I’ve been floating through life trying to figure it out for the past year. She is still the only woman I’ve been with sexually. Social media and technology has ruined dating, it was so much easier 5 years ago. All I get is rejection and I go out trying to meet people 4 day a week. All the women I meet in my city are over 30 and don’t want anything to do with me once they find out I’m in my 20s. I’m a nice guy who lives a healthy and active lifestyle. I maintain good grooming and hygiene. I go to the gym daily. I do fun things to experience the beauty of life. But nobody wants me. Nobody wants to share in my joy. Sometimes I wonder who would even notice if I died. My family never calls me. I’m living alone in a different state. Working from home due to the coronavirus. I have no real friends. I can’t even get a woman to go on a date with me. I feel like dating is hopeless. All I want is someone to care about and someone that cares about me. I gave my exwife my all but she didn’t reciprocate it. It was almost obligatory because of the religion. Recently I found a great distraction with EDM music. I was even stoked for months to go to my first rave festival next weekend, which got cancelled for the goddamn coronavirus. I’m fucking depressed and have nothing to look forward to. I don’t know if my life will ever turn out well. I don’t know what to do to finally find peace and happiness in this life. Will I ever get to experience all that life has to offer? I try so hard but get no progress ever. I thought I learned to love myself and enjoy being wi tv myself because I do awesome things. But it doesn’t change what I want Deep inside - a real relationship with another human being. Either a friendship but preferably a girlfriend. Why does dating suck in 2020? Why has technology ruined human Interaction? 2012 was amazing in college- so many strangers would say hi to you on the paths walking to class. I took two years off. I return in 2015 and on the sidewalks everyone is staring at their phones and nobody says hi anymore. Yesterday I went to the grocery store and had a smile on and tried to make conversation and nobody wanted it. I have no sense of community. Who lives in all these houses in my neighborhood and how do I get to know them? It’s fucking depressing, the world we live in.	moderate
dev_pid_67	"Not okay. : It’s not okay to step on people while they’re down. If someone is crying, bummed, or if a kid drops their ice cream, they need a shoulder to cry on. 
It’s not okay to invalidate feelings someone else is having. A stubbed toe, or having a foot removed, people are all from different stories and while one may not know how to do a task or what terminology is for a tool, doesn’t make them less intelligent, or even less experienced. Just means the time they’ve spent has been in other things. 
It’s not okay to belittle someone based on one aspect of their personality or appearance. Someone may be a bit different than you are and that’s no reason to be elitist based on a stereotype or propaganda. 
It’s not okay to make someone feel less worthy of living. People who do or say things just to cause triggers in people need help just as badly as anyone.

dev_pid_75	"Fired today : Today I was fired from my dream job where I have worked for 5 years. I unfortunately made a comment on social media regarding my political opinions on my private account. However, a coworker was offended by my comment, took a photo of my profile and the comment, and sent it to our HR department. I was immediately let go because my opinion did not match that of my company. I did not bash my company or anyone in anyway, it was just how I felt regarding a national policy. However, my company still decided my opinion did match theirs and terminated me immediately. My job was the only thing I have. Luckily I’m in an industry where there are a lot of opportunities. But I actually woke up looking forward to what I did. It was my calling and my life. My job was the only thing I had in my life. My boss teared up as she fired me, as we had a very strong professional relationship/friendship, but it was unfortunately a corporate social media policy.  She fought upper level management and defended me, but it wasn’t her final say. I must have looked like a sad puppy, I thanked her for the experience, told her no hard feelings towards her as this was my mistake, and held back tears as I handed in my badge and left the building. I broke down and hyperventilated in my car and felt physically ill. 
This was my first social media post in a year and I was feeling passionate and wanted to share my voice, a lot of my friends and strangers supported my opinion, but sadly my company disagreed. Now I have nothing. I have an overwhelming amount of support from friends and other coworkers, but I feel so ashamed, embarrassed, and hurt that someone hated me enough to try and sabotage my career and it worked. I have always seen the good in people and have never intentionally hurt anyone else. I’ve never hated anyone in my life, but right now I truly hate this person, whoever they are. I have a chronic illness and will not be able to afford my treatments, I love my home and will not be able to pay my rent now. My life just did a complete 180. I know in time things will get better and I will land on my feet, but I feel like a piece of human garbage right now. I can’t stop crying and I have some very dark thoughts about ways I could hurt myself and that I deserve to suffer. I wish I could go back in time and take my worlds back. 
I don’t know what I’m looking for right now, I guess I just need support, and advice from anyone who has maybe been through something similar. Or even just virtual hugs"	moderate

Few months go by and my parents split up, my dad stays in a hotel and my mom is selling the house, lose most of my childhood friends due to moving and now life is just, plain. Not even boring, just emotionless and flat. No where to go and nothing to do, spending my days in solitaire waiting for good news.

dev_pid_80	"Doesn't Feel too good. :   
I wished someone would thank me for being alive, I wished someone would catch me when I was falling, I wish someone would tell me it was going to be okay.
My life’s become so sad, today I failed again a number on a paper that sticks in my head defining me. Today I realized I had never been happy… with myself I never laughed with myself never told myself I was the reason I was going to wake up happy being me. I was happy because I could see others happy, I was happy because I could make them smile and laugh. In the world we live in the ones who make others laugh are assumed to be the happiest which couldn’t be further from the truth, as I write this, I think about what has made me live for so long. And I concluded that it was seeing others have something that I could only share.
It’s sad to me. I never thought I was smart, I never wanted to be classified, but you gather people with common interests, and those are the people around me ‘smart’ ones at that. I never realised but admitting to them I wasn’t like them would be the hardest, I didn’t want to live a life of lies, telling myself I was like them, but I didn’t want them to leave; feeling they wouldn’t accept me, at least I felt like they wouldn’t .
Home isn’t easy either but it is what it is, I always knew we weren’t rich but I was grateful, I didn’t ask for much didn’t get much too eat and that’s how I lived, but dad would always compare to ‘the geniuses’ the kids who graduated uni at like 13 or whatnot with what he believed was ‘no assistance’ he talked ill of tutoring which is popular in my area. Not having the extra guidance others had always placed me behind them. Embarrassed he asked If I wanted to go tutoring as he realized most of his friends sent their children, but I could see his intentions were to force my mouth and say I didn’t, as he was always belittling those whoever asked for help in life or weren’t just naturally gifted which is what he thought to be the cause of intellect. I knew that if I performed poorly even with him spending the already low amount of money we had I would become the disappointment of the family, with a lack of esteem and confidence I didn’t take up his offer fearing the shame to come.

Rinse and fucking repeat. It's all so fucking pointless. 
The worst part is, I don't even know what to do with myself after leaving. I don't matter to these people yet I'm obsessed with them.

dev_pid_87	Ahh here we go again. : The corona virus. I’m not allowed to go to school, or out for that matter for 30 days. A whole month. I thought, maybe 30 days of free time will allow me to improve myself/learn new skills and such. The problem is one of the MAJOR triggers for my depressive episodes is isolation. My group of friends are the reason I have been recovering. Now that I can’t see them for a month I’m honestly scared. It’s been four days now, and it doesn’t feel that bad yet. I just remember the last time I had a huge depressive episode due to isolation, and it’s pretty traumatic. I gained weight, had social anxiety, could barely talk or move around. Like I was glued to the bed. I hope this time it’s different. If it hits again I don’t know what will happen, what I’m going to think, whether I’m going to start harming myself again. Myself right now thinks and views life different from myself in a depressive episode. It’s scary because it’s like that’s a completelt different person that I can’t control. So i have to prevent it. I need to see someone I know. Thirty more days to go and then life will be back to normal.. hopefully.	moderate
dev_pid_88	"Everything : I just can’t think clearly right now, so I need to say it. At some point I needed to say it. I don’t know if you reading this knows me, or your trying to size me up, or if you’re just a stranger passing by looking for, I don’t know, whatever, but I’m about to just say everything about me. As much as I can at least. All of my worst and everything. I just needed clear my head. This is probably gonna be a long one
As a basis I need to start by saying, I don’t know what’s wrong with me, like if everything I think is because I actually have some sort of problem or if I’m just faking it? Who knows. Maybe I am just faking it for whatever reason, because it’s a lot easier for me to pretend something is inherently wrong with me and not that my actions are the direct cause of how I feel, which they are, but still the thought that I am not in control makes me feel a bit better? Who knows
What I do know is that I’m definitely not normal. I’ve always felt a diluted sense of emotions. Sometimes I’m just unable to truly feel, and I doubt whether the emotions I do feel are real or figments that’s I’ve conjured up. I’m definitely an apathetic person, without care for really anything, having to force myself to care about goals or people. And so I find it difficult to empathize with others, in fact I find it impossible to truly connect with others. Because I don’t care about the people I should care about. I have a long history of hurting those I care about, abandoning them or saying hurtful things because I want to see them hurting. I don’t really know why. Maybe I’m just psychotic. But I never truly felt bad for others even when I know I should. I just don’t feel capable of caring about people. But I’m not entirely emotionless either (apparently I can’t even commit to that). I do feel severe guilt in honesty. I feel guilt that I don’t care as much as I should. I feel melancholy when I realize I don’t have as strong of a connection to people as I should. I wish I could just have normal attachments and sentiments to people but, people come and go, and I simply could not care in the slightest. But it hurts me to realize that. To realize that I should care but I don’t. And I feel pity for those who care. Which is why I try pushing people away. Because I don’t want to hurt them, but I know I will. So I keep them away from me so they don’t have to hurt. Whether if that’s because I do care about their feelings or to simply avoid feeling guilty I don’t know, but that’s the way it is. So if you know me and your reading this, I’m sorry for, everything I know I’ve done. For turning my back, for disappearing, for being unable to help you, or for hurting you, I’m sorry I refuse your attempts at trying to get close or trying to be genuine or trying to help me. I just don’t want you to get hurt.
But that’s just the people. That’s just my emotions and my sociable aspects of all the shit. Of course it can’t be that simple, there is much much more. Where does the apathy come from however? In short, I’m unable to care for others and for even myself, because I don’t feel attached to anything. I mean I literally don’t feel attached to myself. For visual reference is feels like I’m a ghost attached to a host which is my body. I feel a strange disconnect to myself and to the world. I feel as though I’m not the person I see in the mirror. Almost as if I’m simply an observer of my own world, of my own story. I feel like I have no true control but only the illusion of control. I feel trapped and I feel detached. Sometimes I even feel PHYSICALLY detached. Sometimes I feel as if I’m being pulled apart from my body, I feel lighter and I feel numb and cold. So it feels like I’m not me if that makes sense. So how am I supposed to be attached to things in a world that doesn’t seem real? It feels like I’m reading a story, I read the lives of these characters and for a time, I enjoy it and I care for these people. However it’s a fake emotion, because these people simply aren’t real, they are fictional characters in a fantasy world. That’s what everything feels like to me, like everything doesn’t matter because it’s all fake, because it feels like it’s all fake, so why should I give a shit? 
And the apathy is one of the worst things. It makes me unmotivated and it makes me not do the things I do want to do. I can’t solve any of my problems because I don’t care enough to try. I waste every opportunity handed to me because I couldn’t give a shit. So not only am I a mental fucking mess, I’m also just a shitty person. A person who both, doesn’t care about others, and doesn’t contribute. And it’s not as if I can’t achieve. So much feels as if I can accomplish without trying, how I made it thus far. I’ve managed my way through school without even trying, usually doing better than a lot of the students. I am and always have been able to learn quickly and I could’ve been an amazing student, however I don’t care enough to make that a reality. So many times teachers tell me of my potential, that wasted potential I was given that I refuse to do anything about. Because I simply don’t give a shit about myself or others to make it a reality. And so I waste time, and I waste resources, and I am a waste of just everything ever handed to me. I refuse to let others waste their time on me because I don’t see the point. I hate when people try to help me because I won’t change, because I don’t care enough to change. So if you read this and think you want to try and give me advice or try and “save me”, don’t, because you’ll just waste your breath. It won’t change me, because I don’t want to change, I think of myself as too much of a waste to get help. I’m too far gone, it’s too late. So please. Save yourself the bother, don’t even try to help me. That goes for both strangers and my friends.
Even now I’m getting tired of writing this, because I know it doesn’t matter, it’s just me talking to no one. If you’re actually reading this, and for some reason you care, don’t, because I don’t even care so why should you?  I know it’s just me rambling, it doesn’t even make sense probably. I’m speaking to the void, to an audience I don’t know. It doesn’t matter anyways. There is so much I want to say so many thoughts but I just don’t know what they are they over take me. So this isn’t everything as I wanted it to be but I guess it’s enough. It doesn’t matter
However I want to leave with one last note, one important thing I just NEED to say. I don’t know how I’ve made it this far. I don’t know why I’ve made it this far. I don’t know why I wake up or what I’m planning on going for or how long I’m going but I just keep going. I’ve tried to kill myself. Even now I want to kill myself. I want to grab a rope and walk into the woods, and never come out. It’s just the way I feel. I’m tired of living a life where I’m not happy, and I’m not going to be happy, where I don’t care and I won’t care, where there is nothing and there is going to be nothing. What’s the point! I want to disappear, I wish I could just stop. I wish I had died to those pill all those years ago, I wish the rope hadn’t snapped I wish I could just do it. But I’m too much of a coward. Because I know I need to die and that it’s fruitless to keep going but I just don’t. I don’t know what the point of any of this is. The letter or my life. I just want to die. That’s what I truly feel. Is a constant craving for death."	moderate

Chapter 1 - Leaving the Swamp
I was born in a small Russian ghost town called Amursk back in 1999. As I grew up I've witnessed the town falling apart and everyone leaving. My mom was one of those people. Being a decent English speaker she decided to move to the US in an attempt to start a new life. Before she left; she promised to me and my grandma that she will get us out of there. However, it would be years until her promise would be fulfilled.
My town wasn't the only thing failing to succeed. I was a bad test-taker and my grades were awful. My grandma was a regular visitor in my principal's office. I hated my life and started hanging with the wrong people just to feel the sense of belonging and approval.
Finally, on September of 2016, me and my grandma get a call from my mom saying that she got married, found a stable job and has already bought us tickets to the United States. Our excitement was immeasurable.
After all these years I thought that I would finally stop being a loser and become a new, better version of myself. I was never so wrong in my entire life...
Chapter 2 - Melting Pressure
During the first 2 months of me being here, my mom and my stepdad send an application to a local high school. My stepdad is from Trinidad and Tobago and has seen what the lack of education can lead to. He was very impatient with me going to high school as soon as possible. I was super stressed out. I didn't know a whole lot of English; I didn't have any friends over here; I didn't know the culture and the expectations that American teens had.
Being a bad test-taker and being pissed by the apathy that a lot of teachers had towards their students; I decided to cheat. My logic was that if you don't wanna bother putting any energy in gettin your students interested - I'm not gonna put any energy in studying your material. Miraculously, I managed to graduate the high school.
Now there was another challenge - going to college. I took 6 SATs in the following months after my graduation and I failed every single one of them. After my final SAT I said fuck it and decided to join the Army. If I can't work with my brain let's see if I can work my muscles. My parents weren't too happy about me joining, but they understood the lack of other options.
Chapter 3 - Sweat and Sorrow
Turns out I suck at being a soldier as well.
I barely graduated BCT (Basic Combat Training) with all the minimum requirements. 1 less pushup or sit up or 10 seconds more on the run - and I would fail. From that point I already knew that the chance of me graduating AIT (Advanced Individual Training) wasn't too high either. I was right. On October 2018, I got a knock on the door from my drill sergeant saying that I will not participate in the graduating ceremony (both of us already knew that, he just had to make it official).
The process of being discharged is not quick and it takes weeks, sometimes months. During this tiem I met a guy who offered me to move to Nebraska to live with him and 2 other roommates. He was living with his parents, I was living with mine and I didn't sound like a bad option. I agreed.
He left 2 weeks before me and before he left we exchanged the numbers.
Chapter 4 - Great Plains Are Not So Great After All
After I got home, my parents were both happy and dissapointed. There was an unpleasant feeling of uncertainty in the house that none of us liked. After giving myself a couple of days to rest, I decided to call him \[the guy I met in the Army\] and ask if he is still down to move out. He says yes.
After a short conversation with my parents we decided that maybe starting over in a new state will help somehow. I bought a plane ticket the same day and was gone within a week.
I moved in, I got my NE ID, found a job. Everything was fine at first and for the first time I thought that maybe something will finally work out. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be writing this post if everything went fine. After living together for 5+ months we \[me and my roommates\] started to get into conflicts and disputes. It reached it's climax on March 8, when my ""buddy"" started spreading rumors about me and had enough of it. I told him that if he doesn't stop, bad things will happen. He didn't stop. 
That evening - me, him, and another roommate got into a huge fight. Fucked up all of the living room, threw a couple of dishes at one another, etc. To put it shortly, after the fight was over all we wanted to do was to kill one another. I had to move out. I had to go back again.
Chapter 5 - \[present\]
I'm so fuckin tired of everything. My life is a chain of bad decisions and poor executions and I'm so done with it. I had hopes and aspirations, but now I have none of it.

dev_pid_94	It's all me : Im the origin of all my own problems. Not anyone else. Just me. I've always been my own worst enemy from a young age. Looking back on it,  it seems I ruin everything I touch. I can't maintain close connections with people I either isolate or avoid or fuck it up with my own actions (not in an evil way, but my insecurity and fearfullness ruins everything). I'm cursed to be a fuck up with no prospects, or relationships. The cosmos doesn't want me to succeed. I guess I'm just destined to be alone. I literally don't understand what other purpose I serve being alive right now, aside from making myself and other people miserable.	moderate
dev_pid_95	"Haven't left the house in two months...but I'm sick, again. : I was just laying in bed attempting to sleep, and am unable to because I'm so focused on a dry scratchiness in the back of my throat. I can't think of a time where I've felt this kind of feeling and it wasn't a precursor to me getting sick. I've been feeling off and weak all day, but I go through a lot of drops in energy so I didn't think anything of it. 
I just had the flu a few weeks ago. So twice within a two month period where I didn't even leave the house I'm getting sick. I bitch a lot, I feel my life is unfair a lot, but this is utterly unfair. I'm used to getting sick about once every three years and it is usually mild, twice in two months is unheard of for me. 
Naturally I have to wonder if it's the coronavirus, I saw news that it is here in my city. 
Two months in isolation has burned through my food stores, I'm pretty much down to canned beets and peas at this point. Gonna be a rough ride if I'm getting sick as I expect.

dev_pid_96	"Life is just very bland, to an uncomfortable, empty degree : So, for some back context I am 22, male, I live with my girlfriend, 18, and I left home to move across the country for work (New Zealand, moved from Wellington to Tauranga, basically 400km away from where I grew up, all my family and friends).
Things have been up and down, but despite days where things are good, things also feel highly negative anyway. For example, today I spent 5 hours cleaning my car by hand, polishing, waxing, etc and it felt good to clean it up. As most of you may know, when you get into a slump your environments tend to fall down into a mess with you. So it felt good to tidy it up finally. Despite that, I don't feel accomplished, I don't feel happy, partly stems from finding out my girlfriend had been lying to me for 6 months about her smoking habit, and despite switching to a vape to restart quitting for real this time I still feel extremely stuck on that. Not hate, just another thing contributing to this overall bland feeling that things are just happening around me in life and I'm not really involved in it.
I have good hours at work, my boss is amazingly understanding, I have a family wedding approaching in 3 weeks. Yet all of it I feel increasingly detached from.
It's hard to describe, I don't feel like crying, I don't feel like suicide, I don't feel like self harm, I just feel empty, unattached to anything going on, it doesn't matter if I act in situations because bad things occur anyway like I don't exist in my friendships and relationship, so I feel like if I just stop existing nothing would alter, nobody would be affected, like I was never there in the first place.
I have good days, nothing goes wrong at all, but still I don't feel happy I don't feel good it's just a day where nothing overly bad happened so it's classified as good.
I've lost all motivation to show up to my job, I do the bare minimum to pay my rent and bills then I call sick and I'm ashamed of it, I hate being at home but if I show up to work all that happens is I get a panic attack, crawl into the bathroom and have a breakdown for half an hour and everyone questions it.
I can't even bother to take myself out anywhere, unless it's important I shut any idea I have down and just sit in bed.
All of it just gets hit with ""what's the point ill just be using my time being sad and moody elsewhere so why bother going out""
Just needed a rant really, all my friends I had here in town were workmates who have now quit for university and moved away, the new hires don't speak English and are older, my girlfriend is here but she has her own issues and unloading all my unhappiness on her will just make more issues than it'll help because nobody can fix me, except myself and my own motivation to get out of this rut.
I just wish I had a circle to come drag me out of the house, or people on discord to game with, literally any form of contact to fill my time in with and rediscover love for doing things.
Hopefully things pick up soon"	moderate
dev_pid_97	"Reaching out and no one responds : I've been feeling very suicidal in the past year and have opened up about it. No one follows up or cares. My girlfriend just ignores me when I tell her I am having a hard time. This sounds like I am always talking about it but I keep everything to myself 99% of the time. The 1% that I open up I get met with radio silence. Even counselors are unhelpful and end up talking about their life or tell me that I seem pretty on top of things when I am really struggling.   
I feel like I will never succeed at not being a piece of crap in life. I am so lazy and all I want to do it get high and watch TV. I want to help the world but I am so lazy.

I hate my depression. I hate my anxiety. I hate being bipolar. I hate how I trade one addiction for another without even realizing it. And I HATE having adhd with all of my heart and soul. I'm 24 now and have nothing to show for it at all. I just daydream all day long every day. I wish one of the bands I was in back in high school had blown up. I wish I had continued with my drama classes and tried to be an actor. The only times I can escape are when I pretend to be the musician or in the band i'm listening to or pretend i'm one of the characters in one of the films or shows I like. It's pathetic. It's becoming too hard to bandage reality with substance abuse and recently I started starving myself for no reason other than that I don't get hungry on my adderall prescription so I choose not eat. It's making me sore from head to toe and achy, I taste a bitter taste in my mouth all day long and randomly get so cold that I have to crawl into fetal position under blankets until my body calms down. Some nights I just feel like i'm dying. I'm sure I have some kind of disease but am too scared and depressed to go to a doctor. Some nights I just don't care and actually hope there is a terminal illness creeping up on me. I deleted any social media where I know people just to see who would miss me and nobody does just like every other friend group i've ever been in. I was supposed to go back to college this semester but didn't. Aiming for the summer semester but I don't even know why I'm accumulating credits when my GPA is shit and I don't even know what the fuck I want to do with my future. I just hate myself. Approaching 36+ hours of not sleeping again. I'm gonna sit in my bed and entertain myself with the hallucinations and micro-sleep drowsiness while I smoke myself into a miniature coma.

Yes the movies and music and the park I just have emotional break down it’s not because I’m sad it’s because that was last moments we were happy together before all the fighting and etc. the last fight started was because we were coming back from Disney world and my dad gave me 100 dollars just to helps us because at the time we had no money after the park I lost my job. How would I knew taking the 100 dollars would cost me my marriage in my head I was thinking maybe we can use the 100 for a bill or food or etc.

I'm tired of trying to find distractions.
I'm tired of trying to keep friendships going. Trying to find people that understand.
I'm tired of trying to function like a normal person whatever that means. You know, do normal things like chores, grocery shopping, exercise, eat healthily, sleep etc.
I'm tired of trying to convince myself that I'm worthy of love. Worthy of a relationship. Worthy of having someone in my life that loves me just the way I am because I don't love myself as I am that's for sure. 
I'm tired of fighting anxiety every minute of the day.
I'm tired of the persistent voice of self-doubt and self-hate.

I couldn’t care less about fucking clothes or being “stylish” because it’s unnecessary and I’m not trying to attract attention to myself or get a fucking girlfriend anymore. Couldn’t care less about traveling this shitty smelly diseased world just to see some different buildings, people, and also cultures that I don’t understand.

dev_pid_107	"How to cope with the impeding death of my dog with heart disease : Sorry already for any grammar issues, English is not my native language.
Last weekend my 9 year old chihuahua was feeling down and just sleeping, not eating. I had to take him to the vet during the night because his condition deteriorated. The vet took blood and x-rays and said his heart murmur was very strong and I needed to come on Tuesday for an ultrasound for his heart. I suffer from depression and anxiety and my boy is my world, he is my support and friend. He got some medication and felt better, so we could safely wait until Tuesday to get the exam done. After the ultrasound the vet said that he had a condition very normal for senior chihuahuas, his heart was enlarged and during pumping the blood was leaking in the left ventricle. The vet said with four medications his condition would become stable but that he only had one year left  until he would be getting breathing issues, fainting and other things common for heart failure. I was devastated and cried. 
These past nights have been horrible. I can't sleep or eat and I have seen three nightmares, all the same: my dog is dying and I am screaming his name but can't get to him and I just hear his whimpering and see his eyes. I wake up in cold sweat and check that he is still breathing. I feel lost. I didn't know his impeding death would be this difficult for me to accept, before this I at least was understanding of the fact that he is a senior dog and some day he too will pass. I don't know what to do. 
He is now happy and energetic again with the medication but I have a fear that one day in the near future I will come home and he is dead. If you have had the same situation with your dog, how fast did his condition deteriorate with heart failure and was anything helpful with coping with the loss?"	moderate

dev_pid_110	"I'm about to give up. : I don't know if I am suicidal but I am so jaded that I don't care if I will live or die.
I just accepted that my childhood dream of being a filmmaker will never happen. I never really pursued it because of lack of money. I finally bought a camera when I was 21 and I got into so much shit with my family because it was money that could have been spent on other things. And when I looked into doing paid work in cinema I realized it would take several months to years of unpaid work to go after it and my mom needed me to pay bills now. At 21, the age I should have been trying to start my life, I was expected to pay off the house that we were living in which of course no one at 21 could possibly do. We lost the house anyway and I am now almost 30 and I still share a room with my brother. I still get guilted into not moving out because my mom can't afford rent without me. I am basically in a pickle where I can't afford to make my mom and myself happy so I chose my mom's happiness. And I feel like living in Orange County is just extra salt in the wounds. It's so close to Los Angeles where the film industry is centered in yet it is inconveniently far enough that my busy work schedule (I work a safe office job that drains me of my mental energy and I have only gotten stupider since taking it) makes it too difficult to actually be there. And the only way I can describe the OC is that it is Los Angeles for people who think mayo is spicy and their favorite artist is Hootie and Blowfish. 
I refuse to date at this point because I can't look at myself in the mirror. I hate myself for just giving up on my childhood dreams and I don't feel worthy of being loved. This is not a life I would want to share with anyone. 
I don't know what else to write. I know that I won't kill myself but if I knew growing up that this is how my life would turn out I probably would have. And I did try making YouTube videos with friends but it never happened because of scheduling and friends suddenly thinking they were too talented for me when all they did was get a few roles as an extra.

I had to go to court for it every year until I turned 16, through that time I went to many different psychologists, was on probation for a year and finally started taking medication!

All of this anguish, pain, self doubt, and hopelessness has cursed us, we have even been thrown into the darkest depths of emotional emptiness, nothing to fight for, nothing to live for, there seems like there is no salvation, we are abandoned. Trust me I’ve felt it. 
But isn’t it beautiful, isn’t it the most poetically glorious thing, when the soldier walks through the trenches of hell, through bombardments of demonic fire,  the strongest adversary he has ever faced in his life, losing friends and limbs. It seems like he will never be whole again, but forty years later, maybe fifty, he is sitting in his old wooden chair, his grandchildren playing in the yard, and finally, there it is, strangely... peace, freedom, everything he had fought through has led him here, but he had to fight like hell, he had to push through, he had stared death himself in the face and had the guts to stick it to him. 
Why let it all go now? Yes you may never be able to achieve your ultimate dreams, yes you may never meet your dream  partner, yes you may not even reach your goals or the expectations of others, no matter how hard you try, that’s reality, but that’s just how it is, but there IS a life out there, and it’s better than death, one that isn’t as painful and shit and unbearable as it is now, there 100 percent is, maybe as a school teacher, maybe even a construction worker with all your construction worker buddies, maybe you find something you are good at, Ju jitsu, painting, music, maybe you find a friend you love spending time with, maybe you finally meet a girl or boy with great effort, maybe step by step after years you overcome the social anxiety, maybe you build yourself in the gym and form a body you never thought you could have, maybe you could get a job that you are atleast content with, and you can use that money to help and improve others, it may not be a life of glamour, but it’s something. And when you set those goals, and you work towards them with everything you have, every single hour, second put in, with every blood sweat and tear poured in and you finally make it, with little goals like this, wouldn’t it feel infinitely better? 
And when you had walked through the roaring fires like those soldiers before you, and you’re standing on the peak, the peak you have for yourself, you will know that you have made it, you made something of your life, there isn’t only emptiness, at that point, I promise, it will have all been worth it. 
The weak die by giving up, suicide? No such thing, that is pathetic, we all fade away in the end, no matter where you are or where you who you will end up like those who have given up, but what differienciates you? You fought, you stayed when those weaker than you couldn’t, be rich or die trying, be happy or die trying, you have the right to be happy, and if this life derives you of it, the FIGHT, you may not make it, but atleast you didn’t go out like a coward and who knows, maybe you will make it, if not now, than in 20 or 30 or 60 years but it will and can happen!"	moderate

I don’t necessarily think i’m depressed but I struggle to understand what I want out of life. Currently 18 and have just started University (seems fun) but I don’t know what the fk i’m doing there, people have clear goals with what they’re studying but I’m only there because it peaked my interest. I know a lot of people but only a few I consider close and even then we barely see each other outside of uni. I spend most of my day (outside of uni) training and playing games/distracting myself, though when I find myself doing nothing I try to think of what I want in life and I start tear up. I don’t have any goals besides sporting goals and feel like a huge disappointment; everything feels pointless. What’s the point in studying so hard if you’re not gonna take it anywhere? It’s just an endless cycle of distracting myself and feeling like shit.
There are people worse off, people struggling to make ends meet and just scraping by and i’m just being a bitch right? Maybe i’ll just suck it up like always and walk around campus listening to music longing for a purpose.

dev_pid_129	"I need to know if I'm alone in my thoughts. I need to know if I'm just crazy or maybe this makes sense to someone out there. : Life lately has... Sucked for me to say the least.
 I dropped out of college this semester due to depression. I came home. Now my anxiety has overwhelmed me. So many thoughts running through my head. I have no friends back home to hang out with. I don't have social interaction. I got turned away from an amazing job opportunity and it really took a blow to my self esteem. I have to mentally prepare myself before any social interaction now. I literally get drained from social interaction after the tiny bit of it that I have during the week. I lost interest in things I formerly enjoyed. I sit in bed every single day. 
My sleep schedule is awful. I sleep 12-14 hours a day. However tonight I sit here before you all writing this at 6:39 am. Why am I awake you ask? Because I have to change the oil in my car at 1:15pm today and I have been dreading the social interaction from it all night. How pathetic is that. 
But as I sit here in tears for the billionth time of my 18 years of being on this planet, I've come to a realization. 
I am just a number on this planet. I mean nothing. I have the same worth as the ant on the street that you crush under your shoe. I have the same worth as the zebra being tackled by a lion on the Serengeti, that you watch on Nat Geo. I have the same worth as the mosquito that you slap off your skin during summer nights. None of them have names, no one remembers their stories. The only thing people remember in each of these scenarios is their deaths. 
People in my life have talked about where they see themselves in the future. What job they have, if they get married or have kids, where they'll live. Me? No matter how hard I try, I see nothing in my future. Black. 
Over the past few years, I've gotten this overwhelming sensation that my time on this Earth is extremely limited. Like, i won't make it past my twenties. These past few days, I've started to dissociate, I have vivid intrusive suicidal thoughts that have started to make me realize that my time may be coming to a close. Nothing feels real. I feel like I'm floating. 
I'm too much of a coward to purposely harm myself. But the thought of being dead and not feeling anything really brings me immense comfort. I can't explain it, but it's an intense warm feeling that I've never felt before. 
I'm scared of what I just wrote, and honestly I'm scared of how others will perceive it. But I have no one else to share my words with. And maybe if I do end up passing on soon, someone will come across my post on this sub and read just a fraction of what runs through my mind. 
Thank you for letting me share this space with you all. I have no conclusion of what I'm going to do honestly. My head is a cloud right now.

i thought i was close with those people, when in reality i wasn’t. i thought my actions would repeatedly be excused, but they weren’t. i don’t know how or why i’ve become this way and i would do anything to undo it... but, i am a borderline so things like this are destined to happen.
i miss the fun and laughs and memories so much. i’m  trying to get them to talk to me with stupid strategies that i know arent going to work because i’m too scared to apologize and tell them that i’ll be a better person because i feel like they won’t care, and it won’t matter.
what’s done is done and they will forever remember as a toxic and mean person who couldn’t control their anger or behavior, but while i was shouting insults, saying slurs, and overall just being a hateful person, in my head i was thinking “what’s wrong with me? why am i acting like this and why can’t i stop it? why i cant control myself?”
and obviously that’s not a good excuse for what i’ve done, but they weren’t the only ones hating me in those moments. i’m going to be alone forever, and i shouldn’t get my hopes up when i make friends like this again because it’s always going to have the same outcome. the pain and loneliness and rejection is all too familiar, but strikes with the same power it did just a few months ago when my best friend blocked me on everything and told me i would never be in his life again. maybe it’s happening again because i deserve to pay for all my anger and toxicity, for projecting my own insecurities onto other people.
anyways, that’s all. the moral of the story is that i’m never going to have a stable group of friends because of my own shitty behavior that i can’t control, and sooner or later people will start to get tired of it and cut me off or ignore me. i just want to know how to better myself. i hate the person i’ve become. why has this happened to me?
i’ve always struggled with behavioral issues and mental illness my entire life, and it seems that those things still and forever will haunt me to this day. not a day passed where i think about killing myself for the greater good of the world. i don’t deserve to be here, no one likes me anyways."	moderate

dev_pid_136	"Unrelated title : I dropped uni basically because of depression but also because I felt I really didn't belong and I was really struggling, I saw that if I stayed I'd probably end myself, that was just before December.
A week before Christmas my girlfriend left me, a day or two before Christmas day we got back together, she said it was a mistake and she regrets leaving me.
I spend NY at hers with her shitty family who already disliked me, I missed what seems like the perfect family gathering of my family to be with hers, a couple days later I come clean about my depression, to myself more impatiently than to her, she holds me and tells me everything is going to be ok, she gives me hope, I begin to believe that I'll be ok, with her by my side I'll beat it, at that moment I loved her so much more than I believe was possible.
The very day after she leaves me.  All that hope now crushed, any feeling that I'll be ok now gone, at the time I was too sad to think don't suicide, but now it's gotten to the point where I think about it on a daily basis, at first it thinking about it made me scared and cry, now I'm not phased by the thoughts, I have it planned out, every detail about how I'd do it to how the unfortunate strangers would find my body, I feel like knowing that and having it planned shingle scare me but it doesn't, and if I do have it all planned why haven't I done it yet?
I don't know why, I think I'm still looking for hope, I do have a bit but it's far away, in June I'll begin training with the RAF, I think they'll give me a reason to carry on living, but I'm not sure I can carry on till then, u want to end myself now, it's now that I need something, and I still need to do my medical and physical tests, if I fail them then I'll definitely have no hope or reason, at that point my suicide plan will be followed through, but looking at the bright side at least it'll be sunnier on my death day."	moderate

But they still come up to me and ask her help in class, ask me about homework, ask if I can do something for them, and I do it, I don’t why, I just do it, I want to be nice, thinking that they’ll be nice back to me.
I just don’t want to be noticed, but everyone knows me, knows me as the girl that gets 100% on every test.  
I try to stop doing the things they talk about, I do my work quietly, I try not to draw attention to my achievements, I try to look presentable each day, but people still talk.
Even my friend group thinks I’m the perfect one, I’ve realised that everyone in my friend group seems to be sad, or tried to draw attention to themselves about being sad, saying, “I wanna kill my self”” I have depression” “You don’t know how it feels like to be sad” “you don’t understand me” 
I’m not exactly friends with many people in my friend group, but I try to talk to everyone, to see if they’re ok, and if I can do anything for them, they do end up opening up time and I get to help them, but no one really asked me how I’m feeling. I try to play it cool and keep a smile on my face everyday, try to help other to try and feel better about myself.
There’s even this one girl in my ‘friend’ group that’s in my class she killing me on the inside, she teases me, makes fun of me, brags about how sad she is (she literally does that, she says she slits her wrists and frowns herself in the bath and wants to jump out it window there, but then she laughs about it, jokes about it, she says I would never understand. But those cuts on her wrists, she did it once barely, where as I cut do things to myself were people can’t see them, I just do it. I always pese down over the window ledge, and try to sit in it, were as she stands away saying she’s scared of high ya and she would never jump off) 
I wish high school didn’t have This type of environment, I hate the people, but I understand they might be dealing with things if there own so I just want to help and be nice, but nothing ever goes my way.
Whenever I do or say something someone always says oh she’s perfect, I just smile and nod, because I’m too nervous to say anything, I barely speak up because I don’t want to offend anyone, my close friend say I look down too much or should stop doing that with my hand and feet, bug u can’t help myself.

I have this problem that I wanna share almost everything from Instagram posts to very personal things with people. I realized that it is kinda overwhelming for the one who receives. I don't have much friends and I mostly lack on social skills so I only do this to certain people who I feel close or want to be close so badly. 
Through all my life I always looked for someone who is close to me, who trully cares about me, who I can share things, who support me, who fulfill the need of loving and being loved. What I am talking about isn't necessarily a romantic relationship. I had problems with my family for a long time, I was extreme shy, introverted and close to the world and people but deep inside I always wanted significant other.

If only I didn't have the guilt and responsibility of kids and a wife who loves me I could just walk away.

""If you decide to take your life, can you promise to tell someone or call coast?""
I answered honestly and said no. If I finally decided to do it I wouldn't tell anyone, I wouldn't leave a note, I wouldn't plan a date. I'd take a 5 minute walk down my street. There's a 14 story drop cliff.
He said he couldn't let me leave and he would have to call the cops. Unless I promised that I'd talk to someone if I decided.
I lied. I said I'd talk. I can't be sent to the hospital. I've been to the hospital before for the same thing. It didn't help. In fact it made things worse.
I'm just so tired. If I could do this without hurting others I'd be so relieved.

We have no savings, we have no family to speak of or who would be willing to help. 2 months ago I was going to kill myself for so many compounded reasons and I didnt for my son. I didnt want him to ever think I didn't  love him enough. Every single day i try to find a place and nothing comes back. We have nothing. My mil promised to help us buy a home but like everyone else she lied to us and doesn't plan on helping us.

dev_pid_175	"Finding breakdowns satisfying and the reactions of others : I've been thinking a lot lately about how incorrectly people around me seem to interpret my external behaviour in relation to the present severity of my depression. 
I find that what others perceive to be my ""worst"" days, where I am screaming and crying out of frustration and despair, or lying motionless on the floor for extended periods, do not subjectively feel to me to be all that different to a day where I am functioning ""regularly"" in terms of the severity of the negative sensations. Those just happen to be the days where the pain has mounted enough for me break under its weight. I find it frustrating that people around me like my family will ask what caused such a ""drastic change"" from one day to the next, as from my perspective, the day before may have actually been worse because I didn't get the release of a breakdown and the excuse to give into it. Those breakdowns aren't really the result of me feeling so horrible on that particular day, but the natural result of years of unending anguish on ""regular"" days where I have to learn to get up and get on with things despite it. The crisis days are some of the most satisfying because they are the only days when I feel like my external behaviour truly matches the pain I'm experiencing inside, and people around me seem to actually understand how bad things are. I can't spend every minute of every day projecting to the world how horrible I feel, often it takes less energy to act like things are okay, and the things I want in life require that I learn to push through, but it can be frustrating feeling like most of the time nobody realises how much of a struggle just a ""regular"" day is, and it takes a meltdown for them to see.
Often on ""regular"" days I will find myself wishing that things were just that little bit worse enough for the precariously standing jenga tower of my mental stability to collapse just so I can actually get the satisfaction of giving up and the attention of others taking it as seriously as it deserves to be. The thing is, for the tower to collapse it first needs to have been built, and it's the building of the tower, precarious as it may be from the start, that is the most gruelling and unpleasant. It is these ""regular"" days of tirelessly trying to habit form where the depression is felt most deeply, and yet these are the days that others interpret as good! 
Life with depression is like climbing a ladder with weights tied to your limbs, the faster you're climbing, the more ""normal"" and ""healthy"" you seem to others, but the more painful and tiring it is for you. The moments where you lose energy and let go of the ladder, letting yourself free fall to the floor, are the only moments when you no longer feel the weights. These are the breakdowns, the episodes, the days or weeks where you no longer bother to get up, or shower, or adequately eat. But of course, you can't fall forever. At some point you hit the ground, and that seems to others like the end of the crisis, the moment where things start to improve, but for you it doesn't feel like that. Maybe you feel a little bit rested, and able to start climbing again, but you know how painful the climbing is, and you've got to start all over again from the bottom, and you know that some day soon, it'll get too much, and you'll come falling down all over again."	moderate

I'm a freshman in college, and I'm an out of state student. My home life, while not abusive, has played a role in why I have struggled so much with depression and anxiety. My parents, long story short, didn't do much to help when they knew I was depressed, and made me feel awful for taking medication and struggling overall. They are not a support system for me at all, and I am not close enough to any of my other family members to talk to them, which means that my primary source of help was my university's counseling center.
I have dealt with suicidal thoughts for nearly a year now, and recently had a minor incident of self-harm. I feel incredibly alone knowing that counseling is not an option and that I potentially won't be able to see any of the friends I have made in college for five months.

 Every little issue I have with myself gets to me and brings me down, I overthink every little thing someone would say to me, and I make sure to word everything I say so I don't have any chances at accidentally get off on any wrong foot.
My ego just cant take the chance of someone not liking me. I feel need to make sure everyone likes me. If they don't like me then is there something wrong with me? Is there something I dont understand about myself? Is my tone of voice off? Are my facial expressions while I talk make you think I mean one thing when I say another?
I'm not a bad person, I hope not at least. People I dont even know the names of or just meet get me anxious because I think they already hate me before I even get a chance to get a word out. 
Did u do something wrong? Are people talking or criticizing me behind my back? Is someone spreading rumors? 
It all tends to make me force myself into isolation, and I need to get over my ego before I get myself or others possibly hurt.

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy traveling just not what my job entails while traveling. Every time I have to travel for my job, I need almost a week in advance to come to terms with it. It’s just long hours and being forced to socialize even on off hours. It makes me more depressed than I already am. To make myself feel better about having to travel, I always tell myself that I will die before we have to go. That’s the only thing that makes me feel better about going.

I’m afraid if this happens I’ll feel the same way I did in middle school, like a “weak little faggot”. 
I’m so afraid to be myself because I know the real me is sensitive and probably slightly feminine. I try SO hard to not look “gay” and I’m even slightly homophobic; even though some of my favorite people are gay. 
I won’t look men in the eyes for fear that they will think I’m being “faggy”. I won’t look women in the eyes for fear that they may think I’m a whimpy feminine queer. I’m afraid to socialize on any level because I don’t fit the body I’m in and I’m afraid people are going to be weirded out or say something about me. This is causing me a lot of depression.

dev_pid_207	"Finally Leaving : I finally left my husband. We still have to cohabitate in the same house for at least a year until we are able to get out from under it and sell. But I just came to the realization that being financially stable didn't make me less angry or more happy when the person I married, who is supposed to say I'm beautiful and smart and funny says all of those things less than a co-worker I have at work. I should have realized those things when we were dating but at that point I was just amazed anyone would want me. I don't like my coworker but he smiles when I walk by, laughs at my jokes, and everyday says ""I just wanted you to know you are beautiful."" I know it's probably borderline sexual harassment, and he's married as well so it's kind of skeevy but it's depressing that it got to the point of me needing to hear that validation from a stranger, because my husband says those things so infrequently. He gets me treats, and when I get him something in return he actually appreciated it. 
I also realized there's no guarantee I will receive that validation in any relationship but that using sunk cost analysis, when I have upwards of 50 years to live and most people my age aren't even seriously dating yet, is just dumb. 
Last night I bought my husband $92.00 worth of cold medicine, his favorite ice cream bars, and comfort food because he's sick. I made a joke to him when I got home and asked him to help bring in the groceries and he went OFF on me. He was angrily grabbing the groceries and complaining the entire time and saying the joke I made was innappropriate. I got home an hour and a half later than usual and I was also sick. I have been sicker for longer than he has and am just starting to get better. When I was sick he still expected for me to cook and clean and didn't do a single thing to help me.
So I feel like absolute fucking shit. I'm not actually optimistic about the future. I have a half million dollars of house I have to get out from under after only living here three months.

dev_pid_212	"my name is gabby, i’m 18, and i’ve been on edge for awhile now.. : okay so, for starters, i’m 18 years old and live with my mom and older brother. we moved from michigan to a different state in my mother’s hopes to fix her relationship with my abusive stepdad, which ended up making it worse for all of us. they divorced, he went back up to michigan and we stayed here to stay away from the chaos i guess you can say. 
i left my boyfriend of over a year because my insecurities were mixing terribly with my depression and suicidal thoughts. my mood would switch and i would try my best to push him away with any sort of explanation. all i ever did was hurt him, and i couldn’t live with myself if i stayed knowing that i was just bringing him down with me. he really did try everything he could to help me, but it just never worked. i tried to force myself to listen and try but i just got so overwhelmed and tired. i really did want to give up. i’ve recently just been getting the waves of urge to hurt myself in some sort of way and i can’t handle it, so i turn to drugs to help ease it down, sometimes it makes it worse. i’ve never really experienced this emotion before, so you can only imagine how i reacted when it hit me.
my mom has put us through a lot of shit. meaning things with her having parties + getting shit faced at 3 in the morning, her leaving and not coming home til the late night after, her leaving us at the house while she went on a “party bus”, moving every 3-7 months, new boy problems every now and again. she really did ruin my childhood for me. i talked to my mom for the first time about how i was mentally, just for her to tell me that i have no right to feel like this and it should be her hurting, not me. not forgetting the fact that she told me i blame my issues on everyone around me and don’t take responsibility for them. i’m used to be alone, i’m fine with being individual, but when it comes to someone who is practically programmed to love and support you and isn’t really there at all, how are you supposed to cope with all of that?
my ex boyfriends mom reached out to me and offered to help pay for antidepressants to at least help me deal. it’s just so unfair. it’s not her job, or my ex’s to have to take care of me when i have a mother of my own. i’m more than capable of helping myself but i just don’t have the energy to anymore. 
my father has never been there for me. whenever he knew i had the slightest issue mentally, he would either hit me in attempt to make it go away or just send me to my grandmas. i can’t blame him. nobody really wants to put up with someone whose constantly sad or thinking about ways to hurt themselves. 
i’m so used to nobody being there, and when someone does it close, i don’t let them in. i push them away to the best of my ability and i just wish i wasn’t like this. i really need someone to be there for me but my mind is always at war. i really do hate myself. i hate everything about myself. i just hope these pills help me ..all i’ve wanted is to get better and get back with seth and continue my dream to marry him .."	moderate

dev_pid_214	"It's hard to go to work already, but with the virus and the fact i work at an airport, feels even more impossible. : I've been battling health issues for the last year + on top of starting to see a therapist. So life's been extra special on top of normal life bad stuff happening. I call off work probably once a month, sometimes twice. I need mental health days from the toxic environment that is my workplace and my body is starting to disagree with the job. 
Muscles are sore, my anxiety makes my stomach hurt before going in and i feel nothing but dread, getting arthritis in my knee etc. But on top of it all, I drive a shuttle, small shuttle, and there's a pandemic. People won't stop traveling and i can't tell you how many people I've had on my bus in the last week that were just coughing away. I'm out of paid sick time. Idk what to do. My body says i need to stay home, I'm so nervous and down my stomach is wreaking havoc on me. But i couldn't afford to miss more than a day here and there. 
I fear my previous health issues are going to be made worse or reoccur because of how my body is reacting to absolutely hating that i have to be there without protection. I feel so depressed that I'm eating my feelings, spending money on useless stuff to try and make me happy for even a little. But it doesn't work all that much. Little distractions. 
I know no advice can really be given, i have to go, whether i like it or not, but i feel like i just had to tell someone. We're out on the front lines in a sense, and we feel forgotten.

dev_pid_218	"I literally hate my life : Growing up sucked, was always abused and mistreated and mom didn’t out a lot of effort into caring about me. She was more occupied by the guys she brought home and what alcohol she was gonna drink. I also have a lot of mental problems from the abuse/rape/ molestation/ and just being used.
High school was even worse I lost my weight because I was tired of being made fun of (400lbs-245lbs in 3 months) but only made people want to use me for my car and I was the back up friend.
After high school I said fuck it and tried for the military so I got down to 180 and went to meps 12 times and was denied each time due to a tube in my ear that can be taken out but I can’t afford the procedure not that it would matter anymore anyhow seeing how the girl I got with senior year trapped me into having a kid by stopping her birth control and poking holes in the condoms only to find out she was doing it to 5 different guys (I was the unfortunate one who had to be the father)
Also due to the pressure from that I went got sole custody and she’s still in his life (lives with me actually 😓) an I’m the one working and doing everything to support all three of us while she does nothing but stay at home with him. 
Also can’t seem to hold a job for some damn reason! Every job I’ve been too I either got fired for nothing (literally idk why) or I was told I would get bumped to management and higher pay only to be used and screwed and then thrown aside and forced to either quit from lack of hours or no pay or get fired .
I went to college was actually doing online classes and they started the day my son was born but after a year and a half the classes were becoming more and more unable to do due to my son and the fact I was literally working 2 full time jobs to support everyone and watch my son while doing 4 classes.
Have a shitty car that I didn’t even want but was paid for anyway seeing how I was at work and asked my mom and gf at the time to pick it up for me and came back with a totally different car that was more expensive than the one I wanted and had a lot more problems. Fucker actually broke down on me today after 2 years.
I’m just done it feels like everything I do doesn’t matter and no one appreciates it; I’m killing myself trying to find work and make an income while she doesn’t want to work and I barely get any sleep from my ptsd and my son deciding to wake up through the night and decide to stay for 3 hours screaming his head off. I can’t go to therapy because my health insurance dropped me and I can’t provide food for the apartment (small asf and would burn it all down if I was able too) because my food stamps was declined and been trying to get it back for a year now!
I can’t go to a gym I walk around or basically anything I’d like to do for myself due to the fact I can’t pay for it or have the time to do it because it’s either work or home and no in between. I didn’t ask for this and don’t get me wrong I love my son but this life is becoming to unbearable and I literally hate it"	moderate
dev_pid_219	"I've been asleep for a lot of the past five days : My mental health has absolutely tanked. A lot of it is in light of the coronavirus pandemic that is sweeping the USA, and my area in particular. There have been nine confirmed cases here and 54 of the nurses in my area are in quarantine. I am afraid to go outside.
I have quit smoking - two days in. I can't say that I am not tempted to smoke a cigarette to relieve some stress but I don't want my immune system at risk. I am 22 and have been a heavy smoker for around nine months. All of the isolation has really been driving me into a corner. 
Aside from coronavirus fears, I also suffered a trauma back in June that permanently altered the course of my life. I lost some things that were very valuable to me and in self isolation, all I can see is that grief. All I can do is cry when I think about it. Is this really the way life is meant to be? Will things ever go back to normal?
I just want to go back into the outside world without fear of getting sick, or even worse bringing that sickness home to my vulnerable mother, who could possibly die from this new virus. I can't stand any of this. I just hope things will not be as bad as they say they are going to be.
I just needed somewhere to vent. Grief hurts. Today is the first time I ate something resembling a meal in a couple of days. My stomach was upset yesterday and I gave myself a lot of water and toast.

dev_pid_221	"Angry at my 10 year old sister with severe depression : I’m a high school girl and my little sister has severe anxiety, social anxiety and depression.
Every day, she locks herself in her dark room with her phone and stays there for hours (screen time of 7 hours per day). She watches videos about depression and googles how to kill herself painlessly.
She refuses to do her schoolwork, saying she would “rather die than do the science project”. She misses many days of school, then cries about how her friends are making other friends. When she does go to school, she isolates herself from her friends and “daydreams”. She ghosted her best friend from her old school for no reason at all, then cried about how lonely she was and how much she misses her. She doesn’t exercise, eat well, or sleep well. She is so angry and hates my parents for not “understanding” her, yet she never speaks to them. My parents are trying their best to help her, but she says she doesn’t want their help. She has a therapist, but she says she wants to quit therapy because she has been “trying for so long and nothing is getting better”. She only has had four sessions.
Every night I listen to her talk and try to spend time with her, but the more I do, I feel like she isn’t trying to help herself.

I also want to apologize because I don't think anyone should read this as it's going to be very negative and depressing so back out now if you don't want to feel disgusted and shameful to be a human because of this post.
Anyway here goes I guess. I'll try to to organize this as best I can, but I'm in a pretty emotional state right now so it might be messy or hard to read. 
So I feel like either:
A. My parent or parents have fucked me up due to either awful parenting or non existent parenting. I've never had my biological father in my life. Just countless men that didn't really care about me and just wanted my mother for sex before they could leave and move on to the next mentally unstable single mom. One of them I thought was my real father until I was 8 years old which kind of fucked with me when I found out that who I thought was my father was actually like the 5th or 6th man she's been with at that point. I even called him ""dad"" for years. I can't imagine how he felt having this kid he wants nothing to do with call him their father. I kind of feel bad for him looking back on it. Maybe I was just a really stupid kid and that was my fault for getting attached to someone that didn't give a fuck about me.
Moving on though. Getting off topic a bit. More behind point A. My mother since I was maybe 2-4? Has been an extremely narcissist drunk/druggie with mental issues that has only ever cared for herself. She sure could put on a good show in front of others to make it seem like she was the world's perfect parent, but once back home it was ""I want nothing to do with you, leave me alone and go play your games or something so I can drink my pain away"". This left me feeling, yet I didn't realize it at the time or even know I felt this way that it was my fault that she or my real father didn't love me. Why else would he not be in the picture and she wants nothing to do with me? Obviously it's my fault right? I hate myself today, but feel so much love and feel so sorry for that kid back then. Sigh... 
Messed up the post a bit so it may be out of order of how I intended it to be so sorry for that. 
From a young age I feel like I've had the idea ""ok, nobody cares about you, you're all that you have and it will always be that way"". All of this started fucking with my head especially when I would see kids with their extremely loving and caring parents just enjoying life like it was so natural for them. I would think ""yeah there is definitely something wrong with me. That's why these kids are loved and I'm not."" I'd see kids make mistakes or anything that kids will obviously do because they're kids, and still be loved the same regardless of what they've done. I on the other hand would make a mistake or do anything kids do and it would become the end of the world. ""You broke something? You're so fucking stupid! Why the fuck were you so clumsy?!"" Or ""You don't want to come to church with me every Sunday to be forced to believe in something you truly don't?"" ""You're ruining my perfect social image""! She didn't actually say the last part but you know what I mean by that. 
She would tell me how ungrateful I am everytime I wouldn't do something she said. ""You wouldn't even exist because of me."" She thought that since she birthed me, she owned me and treated me like I wasn't my own person. She would say ""I brought you into this world and I have the power to take you out of it."" I became very lost and confused from a young age. 
It also doesn't help that my mine and my brother's only parent, yeah I didn't mention my brother yet, but he is from a different father as well so we are half-brothers both without fathers and stuck with our unfortunately biological mother. Thank god I had him and he was street smart because he kept himself and I alive. Anyway she ended up abandoning us one night when we were 10 and 14. Me 10 him 14. We were hanging out with his friends one night and when we went back home the house was locked and she was nowhere to be found. I of course blamed myself. Sigh... Turns out she just left the state without telling anyone. My brother's friend's mother offered us a place to stay until she was heard from and we had to live with his friend for 6 months before finally hearing that she was in rehab.
Or maybe it was option B: I was fucked up since birth and they never told me anything and just pretended like I was normal, but deep down they knew the ""truth"" and loved me less for it and treated me accordingly. I have no clue if there is something wrong with me to this day or not but honestly even if there wasn't I feel like I've become fucked up and now something may be wrong wrong with me regardless because of point A. Either way I feel fucked. Too fucked to ever live a normal happy life. To do the things most take for granted. To find love, get a job, start a career, to live with my partner, develop hobbies, enjoy life, etc.
I'm 19 years old and I've never been in a loving relationship, yet desperately craving to be in one. I know it is unrealistic for someone like me though so I try to say ""Hey life's unfair, you're just one of the unlucky one's. Deal with it.""
I've never had a job. Fear, depression, anxiety, and insecurity, along with who knows what others mental issues I may have have prevented me from trying to get one. I don't think I even meet the qualifications for a McDonald's crew member. Which leads me to the next point.
I failed the 7th grade and dropped out in 9th. I'm not sure if these were because of A. Fucked up childhood and the mental issues along with it. Or B. I'm just retarded and I'm destined to live an unhappy unsuccessful life because of it.
I have nothing good in my life it seems. I just want to idk maybe love someone and be loved by someone. I want to fall in love, go back to school, maybe college, get a job, maybe a career or trade, and start living my life happily and free and most other things people take for granted like it's just like breathing to them. But is it too unrealistic for me? Will I be alone and like this until I die? God I hope not.
I know I should seek therapy but I feel so fucking afraid. Like I'm too far gone and I'd just embarrass myself and be laughed at for someone like me even trying to be helped.
Anyway this post is getting long so I'm going to have to cut off some bits. I have so much more I wish to type but it won't fit and may be way too long to read. So I thank you again if you read this and sorry if there isn't much to go off, I wish I could add more, but there are even things that I probably don't consciously remember that are still fucking with me soo.. Idk. Thank you again."	moderate

dev_pid_241	Can’t be happy : I just can’t ever feel happy. I keep trying to improve but nothing works and I’m not sure if I’m ever going to be able to accept feeling the way I do. I started to feel like this a long time ago but it never really bothered me because I knew I was still just a kid and thought I would eventually get better when I grew older. I still feel the same as I did back then and have tried so much to get better. I wasn’t comfortable with my body so I got in shape thinking that would change my life but it didn’t. I had never been with a girl before so I started sleeping around thinking that what change something but it didn’t. I don’t even have a reason to be sad my life is normal and I have so many people who love me but I just can’t return the feeling and I feel like I let everyone down. I feel like I hurt everyone that get close to me they say they miss me and want to see me more than they do but it always feels like a chore to be around people and I just get exhausted so quickly. My sister wants to see me more and whenever we do go out I just kill the mood and she keeps telling me to stop looking so miserable but I can’t help it and when she asks me what’s wrong and how she can help I don’t have an answer because there nothing wrong I’m just miserable piece of shit. She told me once that it she doesn’t feel like she even has a brother and this made me bawl my eyes out after I left the room. My parents definitely feel the same way about me but I hardly even care about them because I’m so fucked in the head. I feel like I’m in a dream like something’s missing in my brain and I don’t feel the way I’m supposed to. It’s like I’m not ever awake and I sometimes think that this is just the way it is for everyone and I’m being a wimp, but there are moments where I doze off and I have a dream of a moment from really long time ago where I felt normal and this memory makes me feel so alive it’s like I’m awake and I feel so excited and it’s like my body turns on again and this rush of emotion gets me so excited that I wake up and the feeling goes away before I can truly get a good understanding of it. I want to feel like that all the time when I’m awake but I don’t know how or if I ever will. It was my 21st birthday today and I invited all my friends together hoping to have an at least half decent night but I felt miserable and out of place the entire time. This night was pretty much the most fun I’ve ever had and if that didn’t even make me feel good then nothing will. I don’t want to just live to keep everyone around me happy I want to live for myself but I can’t and I don’t see the point anymore I just want to wake up from this nightmare. I’m not suicidal I don’t want to die I want to live but I don’t feel alive like if I woke up and the past 10 years turned out to be a dream I wouldn’t even be shocked that would honestly make more sense. I’m wasting so much of my life feeling miserable my family keeps telling me to be happy because I’m in the prime of my life but this makes me so scared because it’s just going to get worse from here. Whatever I was really in the mood to type out how I was feeling but I have already lost interest in finishing this  so I’m just going to stop. Thanks for reading this crap I guess.	moderate

I feel stupid and i want to die. : Some friends are trying to tell me that they care abt me and that they noticed how much I talk about wanting to really be dead.

dev_pid_243	"Real consequences of brain fog and melt down : Had a horrible night a couple days ago, suicidal and not thinking clearly. During this time I impulsively bought a nonrefundable roundabout train ticket to go to a large shopping centre for spring shopping. I did this the day before they announced a pandemic. Good job, me. 👏
All I can think of is how angry everyone would be/how much people would hate me for going on a train now. I'm not sick and not in an effected area, but people are concerned and it is common sense not to go on public transport right now. I will have to bail and learn from this mistake. 
And yeah. I think part of me did want to catch the virus so I would hopefully die. There are lots of illnesses one would hope to catch and die from but this one is just the forerunner at the moment. I denied at the time that people around me would be susceptible. I'm a bad person. I'm not smart. My mind is clouded. Happy Friday, hope you're well. Sorry about. Me. Overall."	moderate

dev_pid_250	"Clawing my way out : I've struggled with my depression since I was 12 (I'm 19 now) but recently it's been really weighing on me to the point where I was barely taking care of myself. I made it to 2 of my 10 classes last week, and I didn't want to be alone with my thoughts so I was high all the time from Thursday to Saturday. For the month (longer? my memory is shitty lol) prior to that I was smoking weed at least twice a day. I didn't want to be skipping class and getting high all the time (I actually love my classes) but it felt like I couldn't do anything else.
Over the weekend, I had a bit of a mental breakdown which resulted in me crying nonstop for multiple days (I usually never cry) and I ended up calling my parents for support. I felt really bad about making my dad fly out to my university, but his support has really been helping me. My friends and girlfriend have also been incredibly supportive.
I've signed up with my university's counseling and disability services, so if I have another episode I will have a bit of a safety net. I only missed 4 classes this week, and 2 were on Monday when I was still having my mental breakdown. I'm working on getting a therapist.
Today I managed to get out of bed without someone telling me to (I am terrified of disappointing people so I leverage that to get myself to do things lol) and I walked to my morning class! I was able to pay attention to the songbirds because I left early enough that I didn't need to rush. It feels really good.
Hopefully I can keep this momentum going and be ready to return and work hard next semester!"	moderate

dev_pid_2313	Why do I feel so awkward and sad after sex? : This guy friend of mine and I had sex a couple hours ago. During the act I'm happy and having a good time and all that. However afterward I just feel so awkward and guilty. He has a collection of shot glasses (he travels for work and always gets one from all the places he visits). I told him that instead of cumming in the condom he should cum in a shot glass. So I put a shot glass between my boobs and he came in it and I drank it lol. It's not the first time I had sex with him but I just feel so awkward and weird especially the whole shot glass thing. After we were done we laid in his bed and we kissed and he told me that he loves me then he fell asleep. We have always jokingly said I love you to each other but I'm not sure what love he means anymore. We are both in our late twenties.	not depression

I am completely devastated when got the call from my parents, and I feel so guilty that I couldn’t fly back for the funeral since he’s back in Ireland and I am in the US. Hearing my dad cry is just so heartbreaking, he was such a genuine and caring lad and he would make everyone laugh. He was more than an uncle to me, he was my brother, my teacher. My girlfriend also dumped me a few days ago for no reason. I am in complete despair. Life seems meaningless. I pray everyday and they’re never answered. I am ugly and will never find love. I try so hard to be happier, optimistic, and I’m tired of putting on this facade of being happy and cheerful. I really can’t see the light anymore. I’m sorry.	not depression

I know I eventually have an odor, but it's just not enough to make me shower or brush. Is there something I can do to ease my anxiety and frustration over my hygiene? Are there ways of making the tasks seem less overwhelming/exhausting? Idon't know why I am like this, I wish I wasn't, but some tips and advice would be greatful.

dev_pid_2321	Just to take out what I feel : Like one week ago I wrote a cart to my mom saying how I was feeling for a really long time ago ( It's really difficult to me to say how am feeling, and the most of the time I finish crying ) she took it fine, but the most of the time she thinks am just sad, it's just a face and that really make me mad. I want to go to a therapist and really get better. I mean I try to be fine and it works for a while but then everything stars again the throughs, feeling hopeless, I start to separate everyone, I barely eat and the most difficult thing is to get up from bed.

But I can’t help but wonder if I would be happier with a job that didn’t give me as much stress and wasn’t so demanding. 
Is it the job itself? Is it the amount of hours I work? Or is it just me?
I love my job. I help people. It makes me feel fulfilled. But I wouldn’t say it’s my ideal job. Am I just blaming my job for my unhappiness?
Has anyone left the healthcare field? All advice and comments are welcome. 🙏🏼"	not depression

dev_pid_2329	"So.. this is what's going on with me.. : So when this started, i had a healthy social life, i was in pretty good shape &amp; had quite a few options ahead of me. A solid job that had me making a decent living &amp; was just a pretty well rounded person. &amp; now.. well..
I met my girlfriend on Tinder in 2017. It wasn't like most matches, she was cute, caring &amp; a real pleasure to talk to. I didn't have a car at the time, so as a 27 year old man, I had my mom drive me to her (21f at the time) Parents house so she could come spend the weekend with me &amp; with our parents meeting immediately it set the bar for the future to be laid out easier..
The spark was immediate and I hadn't felt like this about anyone in years.. passion,  love, need. All in 2 weeks.. The next week she drove back to see me, all the same phases were repeated.. she was the one.. she moved in 1 week later, fast I know.. But being young-ish, we didn't care. 
Fast forward 4 months of a perfectly balanced wonderful relationship. I tear my shoulder up at work pretty badly, was out of work for 2 months.. then when I tried to go back to my job, they said I didn't go through the proper channels &amp; that I abandoned my job and wouldn't let me come back.. even after 3 years of dedicated service.  It sent me into a spiral of depression &amp; anxiety to the likes of me having to take medication now.. my one bright spot through it all has always been her.. 
I went without work for a year and a half.. giving up sometimes, getting turned down for easy positions &amp; getting more depressed, but she stuck with me through all of the bad.. there were fights, but we always made up.. 
About 6 months ago we moved in with one of my best friends in NY (We're from OH) and it turned ugly with him quick. So in the process of the stresses involved with the move to a new state then back in with my mom our relationship took a big blow.. I was without work but dedicated myself to finding a job. 
As soon as we moved back I found a job. It was going great but being out of work so long, the activity I was doing caused a severe infection in my foot after a blister burst during a night of work. I called off one night to go to the ER &amp; was fired 3 days later.. more depression ensued.. But still she stayed.. 
2 months ago, my landlord offered me a job at a pizza place he owns... I didn't want it.. at all, but to better my life &amp; our relationship I took it and have been there since. Busting my ass for bad pay but still making enough to provide for my family. 
Seems like things are looking up for me, right? Well tonight 4 hours ago to be exact, after a terrible day/night at work I walk into my bedroom &amp; see a statue of a woman.. I ask if she's okay.. she says yes, but I can see in her eyes this isn't the case. I push because I care &amp; I want to right any wrong that has happened to her. 
She stares.. I say ""you want to break up don't you"".. she tells me to sit down. We've been talking for hours.. But she says it isn't me.. It's her.. she never took time to be a single adult &amp; work on herself &amp; I'm a crutch that she feels terrible about using.. So she's leaving.. 
The ambition came from nowhere, and while I'm proud she's taking life more seriously, the fact that she's leaving me to do so is killing me inside.. 
I feel like it isn't real.. like.. I'm watching it happen to someone else.. But as I've helped separate our things for the last 2 hours, I'm spiraling into depression again. I took a Xanax to calm my anxiety so I didn't full on break down.. But I don't feel right and part of me is afraid I won't ever feel alright again. 
I don't even know why I'm writing this.. I just relived my past 2 and a half years in 5 minutes of typing on a phone and now my heart hurts.. my stomach hurts.. my mind is racing.. what do I do now.. we we're planning on getting married.. now I won't even feel the pressure of her side of the bed anymore.. she won't be there for me when I need her to keep my head from falling off.. I can't say ""hey babydoll"" &amp; have her ask what's up with a big smile on her face... I can't imagine falling asleep without her.. And now I'm going to have to do it every night.. 
I hate this.. I hate me.. I'm lost. 
Forgive me if this is a rambling mess.. But that's pretty much what I am at this point.. A mess."	not depression

I've always hated to be controlled. I hate to have my life taken away from me. Nothing is ""sick"" about that. I have to work so much and then I spent my money on rent and food. It's like I'm just keeping myself barely alive so that other people can benefit from my labour. I don't want to waste my youth with a 9 to 5 job. This can't be everything.

dev_pid_2335	"Having a BFRB isn't quirky it's debilitating. : I'm typing this post with one hand right now, the other is in my mouth as I bite down on my own skin making it bleed. Not fun right? Well to some people they like to pretend it's a quirky personality trait. I know it's hurting me and I don't want to hurt myself like this but it's something I can't avoid.
I have a range of different BFRBs including, Dermatophagia, Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania. 
Dermatophagia - skin biting 
Trichotillomania - the urge to pull out hair from different areas of the body 
Dermatillomania - urge to pick skin
These are the basics of what mine are. Many people aren't educated on the illnesses. I wasn't either until a few years ago when I came across an article on Quora. My symptoms instantly matched and I was finally able to understand my strange behaviours that I've had as long as I can remember.
My problem here is that people treat it as a joke and think it's cool to fake. Yeah it's super call that I don't wear my hair down in case I have a bald patch or have an easier way to pull out my hair. It's super cool to pull out your eyelashes to the point that your eyelids bleed. It's super cool to have people stare at your hands with tiny cuts and bruises covering them. 
This disorder of mine makes me want to take my life. It's not a fucking quirk, it's life ruining. Please stop pretending to have illnesses for a conversation starter.
I'm sorry for posting this here, I don't know where else to say it. Thank you for reading I really appreciate it."	not depression
dev_pid_2336	"One man's dark view : I joined as a door-kicker, an infantryman. Specifically a rifleman in the Marine Corps.
After experiencing the military and a combat deployment to Afghanistan, my personality has shifted drastically from who I used to be. Before the military, I had a very active mind in politics, preserving the Earth, idealistic and optimistic. I cared, I volunteered and had a bright view of the world, sure it wasn't perfect but I had a passion for life and helping those around me. This old me attracted my high school sweet-heart and we had incredible experiences together. Her aspirations to start her own charity warmed my heart, we shared ideas of how we could serve the needy in the future, so much planning and so many deep discussions.
 I recognized a shift in my personality a couple years into the Marines. As I was faced with the hardships that come with the military and the eventual experience of war itself, I noticed I was more and more pessimistic as time progressed. I became jaded, angry, and cynical of the world around me. Slowly, life's value began to diminish for me, I valued my own life less and less. Of course I kept my brothers' lives above mine, as Marines our jobs is to make sure we get each other home alive and safe. That gave me a purpose and held me up. But as before, I believed myself to be an impactful individual on the world and politics around me, now I see myself as meaningless. We are born to die, the world will die, and I don't matter in the long run. It doesn't matter if I vote, it doesn't matter if I recycle, I will die and so will everyone else.
As I changed, I created a distance between me and my former love. She became ever more involved in politics and activism, growing an even greater love and passion for life and people. Her spark grew into a roaring fire, while mine was quietly diminished into cinder. We began to argue a lot more, my apathy was affecting our relationship. I just didn't care anymore, I changed into an apathetic, angry person with a dark and cynical view of the world. I was a cold individual unable to express my emotions properly. I stopped doing things with her, spending more and more time alone. The only time we did anything was on the weekends when we would have sex. Eventually she had enough and left after half a decade together. I went into Afghanistan in the worst mental state ever, and I became bloodthirsty and homicidal.
Afghanistan was an experience, one that I find myself missing. The worst yet best time of my life. A young man spending part of his prime in a God forsaken shit-hole. I didn't care about the Afghan people, I didn't care about the politics, I didn't care about ""hearts-and-minds"", I just wanted to kill. In a way, I wanted to relieve all the anger and stress built up, even if it was in retrospect a sick and twisted way of thinking. We dropped bombs on buildings, we called in gun-runs, anything to rack up the Taliban body count. I watched Taliban bodies fly into the air after being hit by rockets and landing with a satisfying splat, almost as if it was wet rag doll missing half of its body and instead of stuffing, organs and bones sloshed out. Of course it was inevitable civilian and even friendly Afghan forces would be collateral damage, but we always swept that under the rug as best we could. Life is meaningless in a place where violent deaths were accepted as normal everyday occurrences.
Fast forward to now, I am struggling with depression. To what extent, I don't know, I don't ask for help except for that one time I called the suicide hotline. I don't think I have PTSD, at least no symptoms have manifested themselves. My ex has gone on to be even happier with someone else, I have no more purpose in life after leaving Afghanistan because all my friends got home safe. I firmly believe the world is doomed and humanity is destined to die out with a whimper, a small and relatively unnoticeable stain left behind in this universe. Why am I still here? I guess I just don't have the courage to end it, some part of me still wants to believe for the better. Maybe I still have some optimism left buried deep inside me, I don't know. I'm just going day to day, maybe I accepted that life has no meaning and I'm content, maybe I'm just truly apathetic, I don't know.
I am not asking for anyone to reach out to me, I only wrote this as a means to express myself publicly. This is a throwaway which I will probably never use again after this singular post. Thanks for reading."	not depression

dev_pid_2341	The ripple effects of bullying : I was bullied through my entire school experience, and grew up in a toxic household which involved me being the family scapegoat and pretty much my whole family unleashing and bullying me as well. For much of my childhood I felt like nobody loved me or even liked to be around me. I was quiet and weird, played with bugs in the dirt and messy but I can genuinely say all I ever wanted was a friend or someone to be nice to me. Luckily, I’m out, I live with a group of beautiful people and have some incredible friends. Unfortunately my brain will constantly tell me there is something else going on, like that everyone hates me, are trying to find a way to weed me out of the friendship group, people are only pretending to like me because they feel bad for me. I take every piece of information and spin it in my brain to mean I’m about to be screamed at, talked about, or cast aside. I love all my friends so genuinely and deeply, but I just cannot accept inside that they love me the same way. It’s all me as well, nothing of their actions would suggest this is the case when I have space to look at the situation rationally. But when I’m in it and the thoughts start I cannot bring myself to think in any other way than that I am about to be fully outcast and I am not worthy of friends. It’s selfish and stupid.

It felt as if someone was pressing down on it and the only way I can relieve it is if I take a deep breathe/sigh. I’ve gone to the doctor about it and she told me it was anxiety related. However I’ve started to feel it more and more lately, like everyday and it prevents me from doing study/work. Other people (who suffer with depression/anxiety) I’ve spoken to about it don’t seem to have this “symptom”. Was hoping some of ye have an idea about this :)	not depression
dev_pid_2343	"Working theorem demonstrating My Birthday = (anxiety * depression)^2 : It has already been proven that traumas can manifest as a variety of psychological irregularities in later years. The evidence is so overwhelming that I'm abandoning this bit and going with a stupid talk show.
Today on *I'm a Self Loathing Piece of \*audible gasp\** ""I never learned how to develop healthy relationships maybe related to not having a friend until the third grade.""
director's note, we're not going to dive into that third grade thing, but leave it in the title.
\*Intro video of me talking over 90's talk show shots\* Birthday's  can be tough. I fucking hate them. Probably because I suck at them. I never figured out how to get people to like me (I know 'be yourself'. I'm a poor reflection of other people's personalities. Quick aside - I was repeatedly called out in staff meetings and told several times that I have no personality. That I was a flat bore. That a wet dishrag had more emotional range. They gave me extra training to no avail. I couldn't figure out why she was picking on me though, I had the best numbers in the call center).
\*Audience claps\*
Host: Let's get right to it I understand you haven't spent a lot of birthdays with other people, but is there an early one that you can recount?
Me: Well, in the fourth grade, the night before my birthday I stayed at a friend's house. My mom called in the morning to say she was on the way. We were going down to her boyfriend's. I was a big momma's boy. Alright, so = Me and my friend are downstairs watching a movie, but I'm so anxious that I'll miss her that I keep running upstairs to check for her car. It was taking way too long. You know, I'm getting worried. Then, the phone rings. It's my mom. She tells me that they came, knocked, and waited, but no-one answered. She figured I decided that I didn't want to go. So she wrote a note and had my sister put in on the door. I asked her to come back and pick me up, but you know, she couldn't. It would have taken like an hour to get there and another hour to get back. At that point it's too late to take the boat out, so you know, day ruined. Better if they just continue on and I stay with my friend. She promised to call when they were done.
Host: How pathetic
Me: It was dark by then. She wanted me to stay the night at my friend's again because it was late, she was tired, and it was out of the way. I told her that I really wanted to come home. \*Imitates mother\* ""Fine."" But hey, it wasn't all bad. They did save me a slice of cake.
Host: \*laughs\* really?
Me: Yeah, it was pretty nice of them since her boyfriend had bought the cake. Didn't have to give me any. Plus it would have been to hard to bring the whole thing.
Host: ...
Me: ...
Host: Go on
Me: Right. Birthday in the seventh grade, I thought I'd take a three hour round trip bus ride to my old neighborhood to see my old pal and only friend. I called beforehand. Right off the bat he warned I couldn't stay the night. I said that was OK, secretly thinking that if I missed my bus he'd have to let me stay the night. He brought up that it was going to be late by the time I got there, I'd only have twenty minutes to hang out. I went anyway. It was more like five minutes. Heard the laughter as I walked back to the bus stop.
Host: Humiliating
Me: hmph. In the ninth grade my birthday fell on a Sunday and I was big into church. The youth ministers took me to buy church clothes. I was elated. After church they gave me a card with signatures and money.
Host: Boorrrng, yet still pathetic. Any other teenage boy would have hated getting church clothes for his birthday, but you... so starved for affection..
Me: In the tenth grade, my friend from the previous year (we'd moved again) called me to say happy birthday. He asked what I was doing. Which was nothing, of course, He invited me over. He said his mom had gotten a cake. She hadn't.
Host: Oh, is this this the friend that was trying to hook up with yo-
Me: Yeah. That's the one. Quick context - my gf, who had forgot my birthday entirely, would soon break up with me. I was obsessive, possessive, controlling, jealous, the whole stereotype. Well, once she ghosted me, I'd ask my friend if he had seen her, if he could tell her to call me, that I missed her, you know, the usual. He said he hadn't seen her. Didn't talk to her. Might say ""what's up"" in the halls, but couldn't remember. Well, years later I'd reconnect with my ex. Turns out he was trying to get in there the whole time. Told her that he wasn't ever my friend, didn't even like me.
Host: Ok, wrap it up champ.
Me: Young twenties birthday, I went to the casino. The dealer who logged me in saw the flashing birthday notification, he walked over to quietly say happy birthday. He asked what I was doing there on my birthday. I was embarrassed, I panicked. I said I snuck away from a party.
Host: Gross
Me: Another young twenties birthday - driving around, drinking, bathing in self pity. My phone rings. It's my friend: He asks what I'm doing and of course I say \*points to audience\*
Audience: NOTHING!!
Host: \*smiles approvingly\*
Me: That's right, nothing. He invites me to eat with him and his family? I wipe the tears and get the details. Nobody said happy birthday. Come to think of it, he never mentioned my birthday. Was it a coincidence or worse, was it pity? I'll just appreciate the love either way.
Host: Wow, this was sad, but I don't see what the big deal is. Everyone has problems, your's aren't that bad. No wonder nobody likes you. So self centered.
Audience: \*jeers\*
Host: Agreed, Screw that guy. Haha. but seriously, are your birthday's still pathetic?
Me: Good question. I'm not sure the answer. I've learned to cower. I take the day off. I don't advertise my birthday and nobody asks. It's fantastic. I can avoid the shame and embarrassment. There aren't weird looks when I explain that I do nothing on my birthday because work and shopping are my only social interactions. Shoot, I talk to myself more than I talk to others. Full on conversations.
Host: \*laugs\* coo-koo
Me: \*laughs\* No, not a back and forth, More like thinking out loud. I don't want to know why I do it though. To be fair not all of my birthdays are pathetic. There were at least one and a half good ones up there.
Host: One and a half?
Me: I've got more good ones. Like I once tricked someone into being around me
Host: If they were around you obviously they'd been tricked. But, how'd it go?
Me: Oh, the poor deceived soul.. on my birthday she took me on a full day of love. I mean, we did all the things she knew I liked. I blew off dinner with my sister and brother in law because there was absolutely no way this was going to last. Someone showing me affection? They must be stupid.
Host: It didn't and they were. Well that's it for our show today. See you next time.

dev_pid_2344	"Does anyone else get so bummed that there is no Hogwarts or magic and the only thing to look forward to is a 9-5 : I was a bit of a loner as a kid, so I read a lot. I loved all kinds of books. I loved Harry Potter for obvious reasons but I always wanted to be magic and be taken away to Hogwarts far away from my life. I remember reading the adventures of the wishing chair and longing to accidentally stumble upon one of these magic chairs at a garage sale and I would be taken away on adventures. I hoped one day I'd realise I have special powers and fuck off to join the X men or something. Basically, I'm just really disappointed in the reality of life. What is there to look forward to? I just read a post by someone else saying they gained weight because they didn't care cus they'd die soon and 100% me fucking too. I am so fat now and none of my clothes look good. Yesterday, I was in an uber and the guy is telling me all about how he moved here from Kenya where he was a construction worker and tried all these degrees and didn't like them but finally finished his finance degree so he could help his family and bruh, I can't even imagine caring about anything so much that you have that much motivation y'know? I'm 24 this year and I've tried so many different degrees and schools and nothing feels right. Or more accurately, I just shut down and decide it's easier to not do it. Idk?? Which is another reason I'm struggling with making plans for the future. My brain is all ""just kill yourself it's easier"". I was chatting to him about all the stuff I've tried to study on my way to get a tattoo and I was all ""it's just the concept of doing something for the rest of my life is so daunting"" and now I'm sitting here like, bitch you ain't have any problems getting tattoos left right and centre and they're for life SO JUST PICK A CAREER TOO.

dev_pid_2345	Depression after hanging out with old friends : Whenever I meet my old friends for a night out, I get depressed after. I really enjoy the hanging out part, catching up on our lives, reminiscing the past, laughing and so on. But when i get home, i get depressed. Mainly because you realized that all your friends have their own lives now and you can never go back to how you guys used to be. You will never see them again tomorrow or the next day, you will never see them again for atleast a long time. You kinda miss the good ol days and you can never go back. And its just sad for me.

It was very strong.
I know this one is just about women, but I'm sure men go through the same shit.

dev_pid_2347	Just because we both suffer, doesn't mean its not hard : I've met quite a few people who like myself have struggled with mental health. It helps for us all to talk about it together, we all struggle but in different ways and to different extents. The worst thing though, is when people use their own experiences as a means of invalidating yours. Oh I get depressed too but I don't do that, you should just do this it worked for me, it's not that hard I've done it. Its things like this which just make it harder. Like you're not good enough because you find it hard when clearly, it should be oh so easy. The key part about mental health, is its mental, it's in your brain which is fundamentally unique to you. It's not like a broken arm where everyone can do the same thing and get better. Some things are gonna work for some people and some people are gonna struggle far differently. Don't use your own experiences to invalidate another's, its not fair, its cruel and it's ignorant.	not depression

First off: I know that a lot of you are going through worse stuff than me but let me just tell my story.
I am a 14 yo male and I always  had lots of good friends and was really good at school. At least until about 3 years ago. I switched to a new school and lost all my friends, because they stayed at my old school. I got to know a dude(I'll call him A) that was in my class and we got best friends. That year my grades suddenly got really bad and I forgot a lot of homeworks. My math teacher was not that nice and some people in my class (including me) were really scared of her. I got bullied, got only one to two friends and my grades were bad. All of that lead to my depression. At least I had A as mental support.
Some time passed and the relationship between me and my parents got worse, because they were getting calls from my teachers about my bad grades. To all of that I had an argument with A. I can't remember what it was about but now he doesn't really like me anymore, which really hurts because I have known him for a few year now and I always considered him as my best friend. So now I don't really have friends anymore, I got depression and bad grades and the relationship between me and my parents is really bad. Honestly I'm crying very often because I don't know what to do anymore or just had a really bad day. My last hope is to make it to a new school, where I attended, because there I would have subjects like coding , which I really like. I could also have some new friend. The only problem is that I have a 4 ( which is a D in the UK I guess) in 7 subjects and the school I want to go to, has a lot of requests from students with better grades. 
And that's it. Maybe you could comment, if you know something that could help me in any way.

I will either fail or succeed but either way it won't change anything because they were only goals I convinced myself were important. I don't know how to sustain a mentality like this.

I don't really have friends, people at school treat me like I'm invisible, my family's honestly shit and I have so many problems like very bad anger issues, tics, and others. (sorry, those sound just stupid and like nothing but yeah..)
I'm thinking of ending this in one to five years at least. (if I'm not doing better then) But a few things like my internet friend and a few (shitty) relatives that might still care about me a little, are holding me back. 
It's not like I have to make this decision now, but it would cheer me up a bit if you guys would comment your opinion or like, idk..

dev_pid_2384	"Please stop blaming me : I've been feeling like shit for so long I can't even remember not feeling this way. I don't know if I'm pretending to be this way, the environment caused me to be this way or if I'm just programmed to be this way. I sit all day and think about death. In almost 2 years I've just opened up about this to one person but have casually mentioned having issues and needing to talk to some other people. I'm scared to put my feelings on someone else's shoulder. I mean how can you possibly look at a person the same way after they tell you that they don't know what's real. I'm in pain all the fucking time. My chest hurts, I cry all the time, my hands shake and I can't focus. I have my most important exams going on for which I've been preparing for over a year and my brain gave up right at the important time. The idea of not getting out, not getting better and dissapointing everyone around me terrifies the fucking shit out of me. It's so difficult to go on. When my results will come out and they won't be as everyone expected to be, no one will understand why and if I tell them then they'll say I'm making up reasons and I'm weak and it's my fault or I should've tried harder. But I literally can not keep doing this. I need to not feel this way. There seems to be this idea on social media where people say you need to be strong or its all in your head or you are to blame for your conditions or something but it's not my fault. I feel guilty for feeling this way but I shouldn't be. I don't have anyone to talk to or even if I do I feel like I can't. My mouth literally shuts close. I can't bare this.

dev_pid_2389	"I read the book ""Man's Search for Meaning"" recently : Aside from the horrific recount of the concentration camps, it also gave a sweeping diagnosis of the future for America (and perhaps western civilization -- or global civilization now) that automation will create a void ""existential vacuum"", where the intended goal of more leisure time will actually befall a mass depression where people on a wide scale will not understand their meaning or role in life. He goes on to talk about ""The will to live"" and I interpreted his writing as your lifeline/attachment on this Earth is on a spiritual level to some deeper meaning to life, whether it's finding purpose in work, family, dog dad, etc, but automation/robots has replaced many of those roles, so now we don't know what to do with ourselves but be bored and depressed about it. And imho, it's gonna get way worse before it gets better, and ""better"" is incremental, given what we know.   
It's ironic to think that society is trying to upend gender roles/norms (for good and for bad maybe), but I am starting to realize they were instilled for a very specific purpose. Before it was like ""This is your community's intended purpose for your life"" and people walked that path, knowing their suffering had meaning. Now we've created a society where we try to avoid ""suffering"" but then our lives begin to lose meaning. I think it depends on what KIND of suffering (like, central AC or electricity) is different than being in a caretaker role, etc.   
Just wanted to share. It's given me a lot to think about. What role do I play? What purpose does my life have?  
I'm 30 and wanting to move back in with my parents, just to be around them. I know being annoyed by them will make me suffer, but at least it has meaning. I suffer outside of their house too, but I find this meaningless.

Some people will say “oh he’s just a dog, get over it”, but no. He was so much more to me than just a pet. He was my whole world. A light in the darkness of my life. My best friend. Everyone in my life knew how much he meant to me. He’s all I talked about, I brought him everywhere, and he slept under my blanket every night, snuggled up close to me. He was what kept me going every day.

Because I don’t have a Netflix free trial
Kill me today 
Because i hate most foods
kill me today
Because I know for a fact that Starbucks is releasing a new Frappuccino sometime next month and it will make me gain weight and lose money
Yes, your mother will miss you 
Yes, she will get over it and move on
Yes my old bully will make a sappy Facebook post about how what a a wonderful person i was but they are lying just like anyone else who does the same
And I will soon be forgotten 
And yes
Suicide is a permanent solution to my permanent problem of being stupid, ugly and friendless.
I know that
You know that
Everyone and anyone has been shoving that down my throat since i first learned what the word suicide meant
So kill me
Because I never finish my shampoo and conditioner at the same time
kill me
Because my favorite show ended
Because all of the food I make comes out terrible 
I should kill myself
Because I will keep coming up with reasons for me to do so
And nobody needs me
But they will lie and say
Don’t kill yourself
I love you
You’re important
It’s a bad day
A bad life
There is more to this
The world will keep spinning on its axis without you
They are lying because they pity you
Think of all the sunrises you’d miss
I never wake up for sunrises so that wouldn’t be true
But when im sitting in front of everything deadly i own
(I have no idea what that means) 
Revising your goodbyes
There will be too much darkness 
To see anything else
Nobody will care if you say goodbye
This is about turning off the lights, forever
This is about finding the bed and then the noose 
To jump off my bed and hang myself
This is about giving yourself one more day
Even if it takes ten thousand of those
I’ve actually had ten thousand and one days of giving myself one more day
And now is time to give myself this day of saying peace out mother fuckers 
One more morning’s
Until
“I can wait for tomorrow”
This is about being dead
Because I don’t care that there’s gonna be a new Marvel movie
I should miss that
This is about me dying
Because the future is coming 
And its looking very badly for me
I see it
And I know i cant make it 
Until then
I will kill myself.

dev_pid_2403	"Musicians/Artists: How do you get through creative lulls and a lack of inspiration. : I’ve been writing/playing music for a couple decades now: The last couple years have been rough. There was a point where I would play music for at least a couple hours every day. Now it’s very common that my guitar will stay in its case until it’s time for my next (weekly) band practice. When I do play solo, it’s turned to mindless noodling around rather than any writing because I’m just so uninspired.
Typically in the past, that meant I needed to listen to more music. I believe with music you need to listen more than you play. So the solution was to have my mind blown by other more talented musicians and have that inspire me. But as of late, I don’t listen to many albums anymore, just Spotify playlists on random as background noise rather than foreground inspiration. Music doesn’t move me like it did a couple years ago. 
Furthermore, the more I listen the more I realize: It’s all been done! We have a limited number of notes to work with and a limited way of arranging them. Even stepping outside of the limitations of 12-tone western music, it’s all been done. So not only is any active listening not inspiring me, it’s actually discouraging me: “What’s the point? I just sound like a cheap \_\_\_\_\_\_ ripoff.”
I’m very one dimensional, if I had to list my hobbies in the past I’d say: Playing music. Collecting records. That’s it. I can’t stay interested in anything else. So, when music isn’t happening for me, it’s devastating. It’s been a rough couple years. I should just quit music until the feeling of “I need to play” returns, but without music, I have nothing. And I’m in a band where I’m called upon to be one of the main songwriters, it’s one of my only… wait, it’s my only form of socialization: Making original music in a dead music scene.

Being successful and well-regarded in my job has been of the utmost importance to me as long as I can remember. I have always been underpaid and used in jobs getting closer to what I feel like I deserve after over 10 years in my industry and close to being on par with the average salary in my industry. I have finally had the opportunity to have some control after my job fired everyone except for me and kept me around because I am ""the cheapest"". Yes, they said that to my face. I thought that if I worked hard enough I could prove I deserved my position and would be paid accordingly, but even at the threat of leaving this company and essentially my office will close down if I leave, they still will not pay me what I deserve. 
I am so tired of feeling like I am not worth anything when I have done nothing but continuously prove myself over and over. I have made this company millions of dollars from MY WORK. I can't explain how crap I feel. And because this seems to be a running pattern, it must be me. There is something wrong with me. Something that tells others that I have no value.
Maybe I don't. Maybe I will never have any value. I don't want to keep trying to prove everyone wrong when clearly everyone is right and it is me who is wrong, thinking I am worth something.

I’m not the kind of person who is constantly sad or just feeling down. My problem is less being sad, but more just feeling nothing. I feel devoid of any emotional substance, but normally I continue on because that’s what’s expected me.

It’s like seeing loose threads, waiting to be pulled and unravel everything in front of my very eyes. I’m anxious, I don’t feel comfortable confiding in anybody; and being a realist, I know that my situation is going to get much harder before it can become better.

We were great together, we'd go out and have our version of fun (not clubbing like the majority of uni students cause I honestly hate it) and I even met my now boyfriend when out with her. Last summer she texted me out of nowhere saying she's dropping out. My grandma has also just passed away and honestly, I just felt like shit and cried for a few days - I am NOT a crier.
The beginning of second year was terrible, I felt lonely and depressed and the only one to snap me out of it was my boyfriend. He encouraged me to become better friends with people from my course and I did. It was all nice until a couple of days ago I had a bit of an argument with one of the girls in the group and now everyone is just avoiding me. If I ask a question directly to someone they'll answer out of politeness but make it really awkward. When I left to go get lunch I said bye and no one answered. They all sat together and did not invite me over. At the end of the day, they all just left and didn't say a word to me, even though I was right behind them. 
To make everything worse I'm supposed to live with them next year and I have a hunch it's just gonna be hell.

dev_pid_2427	"(20 M) Hair's falling out in stupid way and I hate it. : For the past 5 or 6 months, my hair's been thinning out right at the top and the front. I don't have a bald spot, and my actual hair line is still relatively normal for my age (still might be a Norwood 0 even). But for some reason it's like I'm missing a crucial layer of hair at the top that's supposed to keep everything flush. There's just not enough hair to match the thickness of the sides and the back, so I look like a homeless crack addict or something.
I keep getting faded buzzcuts now to try and not make the disparity so obvious, but after about three weeks the homeless crack addict look starts to return because the sides and the back start to stick up while the top and the front stays matted and flat and split.
I hate it. I hate it so fucking much. I don't want to spend my 20s looking like this. I've never even been with a girl yet and now my chances of attracting a girl have only gotten worse. 
I'm trying my best not to let it get to me, but some days I get so insecure that I become reclusive and never even set foot outside. I already suffer depressive episodes and this makes everything worse. 
If this happened in my 40s or even 30s while I had already built up a suitable reputation in some sort of field then I wouldn't mind it, but now? When I'm supposed to be young and dumb and still finding myself? This is fucking bullshit.

Some backstory: I never thought of myself as having depression. I have always, though, considered myself lazy and unmotivated and have had pretty low self esteem as long as I could remember. Recently this lack of motivation, drive, and self esteem has started to negatively impact my relationship of \~4 years. I just can't seem to make myself do what I need to do, to be disciplined, and I've been consumed by self loathing. My SO goes to therapy for their anxiety and has been talking to their therapist about the strain this is putting on the relationship. The therapist thought what my SO was describing sounded like textbook depression and so my SO relayed that back to me and suggested therapy. The thing is though, I don't really have that feeling of melancholy and sadness that you hear most when people describe depression. I just don't want to blame my personal faults on depression if I don't really have it. But I've tried many times to change the things I hate the most about myself and have never been successful.

I don't think she understands the true depth of my depression. After that one night everything was like it was b4. Like I was just feeling sad one night. But it's not. As if I'm someone who doesn't know what sadness is. I regret every bit. I wish I could just have some time to b alone in my head.

My family is just fucked up too so it's all up to me to push through and leave them behind
But I don't have friends. The two online friends who I went to this uni in small part to meet/ hang with in my down time turned out to be flakey and unreliable as hell, I'm too busy keeping up with school to really stay commited to a club haven't made friends and this fucking virus is basically encouraging isolation. Also with the virus, I'm trying to keep my OCD at bay by not freaking out over it, but every where I go fucking people wanna flip out over it and get annoyed when I encourage not full on panicking.  
This morning I tried to work on my math midterm reviewing by taking a practice test, which because my brain is burnt out and slow, it took me 5 hours, went to take a walk and that turned into a depression attack that's taken an hour ish to get through . . .I just, hate my life right now.

dev_pid_2436	I can only find happiness from external sources : I’m not sure if I’m depressed as I’ve never talked to a doctor or anyone about it. Throughout my life I’ve always had periods of time usually lasting between a couple weeks to a couple months, when I just feel so alone and that I don’t want to keep going. I’ve definitely wanted to be dead, but I’ve never been close to suicide and I don’t think I ever would kill myself. Usually these periods are triggered by some event, often relating to friendships or relationships. I was dating a guy for a few months and I was so happy. Then we ended things, and I would break down crying on the way home almost every day for a month. Sometimes about him, sometimes just from being sad and lonely. People say you need to find happiness on your own before trying to be in a relationship, but I feel that all of my happiness comes from external sources like this.

dev_pid_2442	"I am struggling to help my depressed friend... I'm really trying but they constantly berate and lash out at me : I am at the end of my tether, so I would really appreciate some advice please.
A friend of mine - who I have known for nearly 20 years - had a bit of a bad turn in the past two years. He (34) is based in one country, and I (F, 34) currently live halfway across the world. He is what you would consider ""friends who are family"". Or least I thought so.
Lately, I am finding it very difficult to deal with him, and I feel that I should cut him out of my life.
**A summary of his situation:**
1. His marriage fell through a couple of years ago. His decision. He has one young child (bit of a mess, he broke up with her whilst she was pregnant, something I never agreed with). They were having problems for years; he claims she is the reason for many of his mental health issues.
2. Since then he has gone from not drinking - to drinking regularly. Sleeping around, making friends with weird people etc
3. It reached a stage where last year he was talking to me about suicide, and how he has planned his death several times. He talks about how no-one in his life is there for him (mum, dad, ex-wife, sister).
4. Now - he has fallen into trouble with the law, accused of something pretty serious. I have no doubt in my mind he is innocent (despite the changes of the past few years), so that's not even a question. Just to add context to his background, he is educated to doctorate level, intelligent and has a good job (he's currently suspended until police make a decision whether to charge him) and has never been in trouble with the law before.
**The issues I encounter:**
1. At the best of times, he is quite insensitive in the way he deals with people. He can be quite cutting with his words at times, and I feel in the past, he hasn't been there for me when I needed him the most (a couple of situations). That being said, he was married, in a different country...etc. so I kind of get it. People get busy with life.
2. Because of a childhood complex, he doesn't like people giving him advice. So even when you try to have a conversation with him, and offer some solutions, he lashes out about it and gets angry.
3. I have recommended therapy because I know how much it helps. He says he has been, but was never given any medication (he's not sure if he wants to take meds), and since the one time he went, he hasn't said anything else about it. TBH, I don't think he even went back.
4. More recently - with this ""trouble with the law"" situation... he would send messages like: ""I am going to be charged... I just know it. I am going to lose my child. I have no faith in the justice system. I cannot go to prison. If I am charged, that's it; I am ending my life.""
5. I personally feel he's not taking enough action. He's not speaking to many lawyers, for instance. He is with one lawyer who doesn't seem to be doing much. He comes across as being very indifferent about the whole process. He asks me what I would do if I am in his position. I tell him. His response? ""You don't think I haven't thought of that? You think I am just sitting there doing nothing? You think you're all high and mighty. I have never been in trouble with the law. I am so scared. I have no idea what to do or how anything works."" etc. I ask him if he trusts the lawyer he's with. He says: ""I don't know; how do I even figure that out?""
6. After his latest outburst, I told him to get his act together and enough with the victim mentality. In hindsight, my choice of words were not great - but there's only so much I can take. I attempted to explain to him that the concept of victim mentality also applies to genuine victims (I had spoke to this with my therapist before), I never once implied he was faking it, but in order for an individual to create change they have to leave the victim mentality and go into survival mode. To me, he is being defeatist right now when he needs to fight to clear his name. No-one in the world can do something like that for you but yourself. It's what I would do personally.
7. He responded by saying he thought I was a ""disgusting human being"" and an ""insensitive prick"". And for the past 24 hours has latched on the words ""victim mentality"" when I fully explained what my point was. He then proceeded to say ""No matter how many times I tell you, I have no idea what's going on. You're just assuming I am sat at home being defeatist."" Earlier, he made a reference about how I have always butted in about his life. The funny thing is... It has always been him coming to me with the problems. I even went through old emails today to make sure I am not going crazy.
**What do I do?**
I am tired. I feel I'm his emotional punchbag. Despite him calling me disgusting, I am trying to be there with support just for the sake of his child.
Every time he has gotten angry accusing me of having no idea what is going on, I have reminded him that I am not in his environment. I am not in the middle of it all, therefore I just go by what he is telling me from halfway across the world. Which is usually not much. He is the one who usually initiates conversation with messages like ""I know I am going to jail. I just know it."" I try my best to be there and listen, whilst trying to offer some hope.
I have offered financial support for legal fees. I have offered to talk to lawyers I know. I have offered friends who are connected to law. He hasn't taken any of my offers.
He complains about advice given to him. Then asks me what I would do if I were in his position. I answer, and then he gets angry at me. You know that feeling of that you cannot win, no matter what? I don't know what he wants, and I don't know how to help him.
I have had my own mental health issues, but it's in my personality is just to own it and do something about it. I made myself go to a psychiatrist; I took the medication; I made myself go to a therapist. I strongly believe that no-one in the world can help you but you - you need to be the one to take action to save your soul. Not everyone is the same, I understand that. But this is not helping my own mental health.
I have never wanted anything from my friendships, but it doesn't feel good to absorb this much negativity on a delay basis. It does affect me. His words can be immensely hurtful at times. I understand that this might be due to what he is going through, but there's only so much I can take before I am at breaking point.
I apologise for this being a long read, but I wanted to offer as much background as possible. I'm hoping I can connect with someone who could give me advice on what to do in this situation.
Thank you."	not depression

dev_pid_2471	My day was better than I thought : After work I decided to schedule a last minute therapy appointment, I’ve been contemplating it but felt it wasn’t necessary. As it got closer to 10:30am I started to get frantic and overwhelmed, I didn’t want to go anymore. Signing in I was shaking I’ve never been to therapy and I didn’t know what to expect, the fact that I was alone in this place terrified me. I get so worried they’re just going to say I’m crazy and lock me up. Meeting and speaking with the therapist wasn’t as horrible as I thought it would be. I still feel stupid, now I’ve included a stranger in my mess.. I’ll be going again to learn ways to properly deal with this empty feeling, I know I have a lot of baggage but it was nice to finally speak to someone about everything and get a different perspective. I’m not suicidal anymore, I’m empty and I’d like to believe there’s more to life than this void. I feel a bit more positive overall and I did tell them I don’t want medication, I used medication as a huge crutch and it made me worse if any thing. I’m ready to take the next steps forward in taking back my life. I needed to do this for me and my dog he’s my motivation, I’d do anything for him I love him and getting better for him is my biggest goal.	not depression

dev_pid_2481	"An Open Letter to the Guys That Mocked a Suicide Victim : This is something I wrote a while ago, summer of 2017. It's on my mind today and I thought I'd share it. 
I'm sorry that I spoke out of turn and said that you don't know what you're talking about. I shouldn't presume to know your personal journey. But when the topic of a suicide victim comes up, and you mock the dead, I don't think you *do* know.
That boy was either severely depressed, or mentally ill, or some other similar ailment. He reached out to that girl. I don't know if his intent was to cry out for help, to say goodbye, or to make her feel guilty. I don't know, because he's dead. He's dead because he got back in the car.
She urged him to do it. She told him to get back in the car.
Would he have done it anyway, no matter what? I don't know, but that's what you said, laughing about it like he was such a fool. He's the one who did it, you said. She didn't make him get back in the car, you said. Words like idiot and stupid were used.
So I spoke up. ""I'm sorry, but y'all don't know what you're talking about."" One of you said your brother killed himself, the other said you'd lost some friends. I'm truly sorry for your losses. That's not what I meant, though.
Until you've been there, you don't know. Until you've actually been on the brink of suicide. Until you've stood there, racking your brain, weighing the pros and cons of life or death. Thinking of all the reasons you should just do it. How you've accomplished nothing in life, and you have nothing to offer the world. How your family and friends won't miss you that much, and will be better off without you.
I've been there, close, a time or three. Only once was I prepared to go through  with it. I was stopped by a chance call from my then soon-to-be-ex-husband, calling to gripe at me about something I don't even recall all these years later. He didn't know what was going through my mind, he didn't know what I was about to do. I didn't tell him. He was mean and entitled and it made me so angry. That anger is what stopped me. I didn't know what I was going to do, or how I was going to manage, but for the first time in a long time, I was angry instead of just hopeless. It took something so tiny to pull me back up. To this day he doesn't know that he unintentionally saved my life. Maybe it's petty, but I don't feel he deserves to know. 
I still have moments when I wonder what's the point. I'm open about my struggle, as open as I can be, with my friends and family. It's not easy. My heart know all the reasons to keep going, the ones my head sometimes forgets. I take things one hour at a time, because an entire day can be overwhelming. Days like today, though, they hurt my heart. They leave me feeling a little more broken. Forget sticks and stones... words can fucking hurt.
Again, my heart goes out to you for the loss of your friends, and your family member. But unless you've actually been in their shoes, in my shoes, you don't know."	not depression
dev_pid_2482	"A lot of us will have to stay away from work due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Here's some things you could do to stop a downward spiral. : AIf you are, like me, a semi-functional depressed, work is giving you a lot of stability for everyday life. I'm currently in an optimistic state and I wanna try to share a couple of ideas on what to do with all the extra time - rather than fall (back) into bad habits and start or continue a downward spiral.  
An extra advice is to write down, what you've done that day, without judging your activity (as in: if it's a day spent in bed, just write it down, don't beat yourself up over it!). Some might require buying tools in advance, just make sure you wash your hands before and after.  
\- repairing all stuff that's broken in the house (why is my fridge still leaking and my knife so dull, damnit?!)  
\- deep cleaning - yeah I know it's not fun, but do I actually still need that mixtape from 1997?  
\- pick up a skill - I recently learned how to bake bread, and make simple cheese. But you could do woodworking or other useful stuff.  
\- try some crafts  - this is not ""useful"" as a skill would be. It's ll about fun, Arts &amp; Crafts and things such as bookbinding, painting, drawing, building plane models, whatever rocks your (DYI)boat.  
\- reading - oh yes, you can find out what kind of literature you ACTUALLY like, not the stuff you've been told to read by teachers.  
\- boardgames - assuming you're not alone in that situation and it's more about prevention than one of the family being ill (because don't share cards and dice, if you don't wanna catch the bug!). There are tons of cool games out there on different levels of skills.  
\- fitness - if you somehow managed to keep a habit of doing sports or even going to the gym, try to make a home-workout possible: yoga mats, weights and other things often don't cost incredibly much.  
\- other things like digitizing old photos, getting things in order (...paperwork...?!)  
I know this sounds ambitious and in noooo way, am I gonna do all of them. But lets start with one, first step,.  
If you have anything to add, please do. Let me hear if you made plans yet."	not depression

dev_pid_2484	"5-HTP plus St Johns Wort : Im wondering if anyone has tried this combination. Il just quickly explain why Im asking -
On a quick search of reviews I can see people are saying the efficacy of 5-HTP is very high, but the scientific evidence is it is not. 
Digging deeper, it was not difficult to find some unique use cases for 5-HTP one of them was people using it on a comedown for MDMA. If you read them threads youll realise that there must be truth to this as there is no advantage for those guys to recommend that for sales or other.
Further, Drs will deny 5HTP value but recommend not to take with SSRIs as this will cause serotonin syndrome.
It is therefore my opinion that the mechanisn for this is using a drug with inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (SSRI) in conjunction with a substance that increases the level of serotonin in the body in general (5-HTP) that causes this issue.
Back over to MDMA, we know that this drug will inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline in huge quantities. The risk to taking 5HTP too early on the comedown is highlighted by many users. I think its obvious to add this point to say that it is by the same mechanism that 5HTP helps on a comedown. The potency of the MDMA is decreasing as it goes past its half-life. The 5 HTP pushes a surge of serotonin into the system and the drug can still use that as the MDMA effects become weaker. Easing the withdrawl symptoms of MDMA.
Another possible onservation to be made at this point. The people who find relief from 5HTP alone will have issues PRODUCING serotonin but not in the bodies efforts to regulate the neurotransmitter. For those where 5HTP alone does not work it is because the body isnt able to do anything useful with the serotonin in the system.
Cue St Johns Wort, according to research this works similarly to SSRI for both serotonin and dopamine. In fact adding tyrosine into the mix could potentially increase the leves of dopamine also as it is its precursor. In theory a mix of 5HTP and st johns wort could be as effecting as presciption medication."	not depression

DBSA is aware that the current public health emergency COVID-19 is causing many people anxiety. Needless to say, taking care of mental health and wellness plans during this time can be challenging. Living in wellness with a mood disorder requires time, energy, and conscious effort; each individual has to find a path that works best for them. When new stressors are introduced, extra attention to self-care and wellness management are necessary. 
For many right now, schedules and routines are being interrupted. Events and meetings are being canceled or postponed. Social distancing can cause feelings of isolation and disconnection. Some feel compelled to absorb news and media—including social media—which can heighten anxiety and panic. However, there are ways to manage anxiety and stay grounded, which ultimately has a positive effect on your mental health.
## Stick with the Facts
Though often unintentional, misinformation spreads during public health emergencies. Getting information from credible sources is key to maintaining a helpful level of awareness. Both Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization offer up-to-date facts to stay informed and resources to help stay well.

## DBSA Wellness Resources
### New Podcast
DBSA spoke with Dr. LaGenia Bailey, former DBSA board member, for tips on how to stay well during this public health crisis. In this podcast, she addresses benefits of mindfulness practice, lifestyle habits, and ways to stay connected with others to avoid isolation. [Listen to the podcast.](https://secure.dbsalliance.org/page/m/913458b/5fd5bff7/4423b4f5/549431c6/152569886/VEsA/?g=bzxvJFNw52hbJKjlqvE0ubA)

These sciences include sound, mindfulness, and traditional as well as complimentary healing modalities. Dr. Bailey is a board certified neuropharmacologist, a yogi, musician, and singer. She uses her knowledge to help guide people to wellness.*
### Peer Support
CDC is recommending avoiding close contact with others. Some DBSA support groups are using digital meetings to continue supporting one another. Another option is to attend a [DBSA Online Support Group](https://secure.dbsalliance.org/page/m/913458b/5fd5bff7/4423b4f5/549431c1/152569886/VEsB/?g=bzxvJFNw52hbJKjlqvE0ubA). 
### Attention to Lifestyle
Monitoring our day-to-day habits like sleep, nutrition, and exercise play a huge role in wellness. The [Lifestyle](https://secure.dbsalliance.org/page/m/913458b/5fd5bff7/4423b4f5/549431c0/152569886/VEsO/?g=bzxvJFNw52hbJKjlqvE0ubA) section in DBSA’s Wellness Toolbox offers education and resources to practice and maintain wellness. 
### Crisis and Safety Management
Because mood disorder symptoms can heighten in times of added stress, creating a safety plan can help [prevent a mental health crisis](https://secure.dbsalliance.org/page/m/913458b/5fd5bff7/4423b4f5/549431c3/152569886/VEsP/?g=bzxvJFNw52hbJKjlqvE0ubA). **If you are having thoughts of death or suicide, call** **1-800-273-TALK** **or text DBSA to** **741-741.

dev_pid_2519	"Roommate is depressed, unsure what to do : My (22, F) 32 year old roommate seems to be depressed. I say ""seems to be"" as we don't really talk a lot. She tends to hole herself up in her room for days on end, only coming out to eat and use the bathroom. 
I'm not sure what to do or how I can help her as she is 10 years older than me. She is also very secretive, she doesn't like to talk or chat much. She does not have family, as I understand it she is an only child and her parents were quite old when they had her, so they sadly passed away at a young age. We are living in Europe but she is from Asia, and I've never heard of any family visiting her. I know she has nice friends as I have met a couple of them, but she rarely goes out to see them or invite them over anymore. The flat we share is one that I found a couple of years ago, so in reality it is my apartment but I got a roommate as I cannot afford it by myself. Perhaps she thinks for this reason, she doesn't need to put as much TLC into the house as I do. 
The issue I am having is the fact that she is neglecting on her household responsibilities. We live in a two person flat share, and in the last six months I have had to take care of probably 95% of the housework as well as the bills. This is something I have mentioned to her a month or so ago, the fact that I am struggling with taking care of the house by myself and cleaning up for two people and that I needed help. The split should be 50/50 on household fees (such as internet and cleaning supplies, at the moment, this is all on me) as well as general cleaning.  I know that she knows about this, and I know she knows this really irks me, but she still fails to help with housework on a regular basis. 
I've seen her mop a floor for example (less than five times probably since she moved in here half a year ago) and it is the sloppiest work I have ever seen. She will take one of those dust wipers, without putting a cover on it, spray window cleaner on the ground and mop over that. The result is a greasy, slippery kitchen floor that needs to be re-mopped anyways. Or another example, is the trash can will be full, and rather than just taking it out (we live on the ground floor), she'll just pile more and more things on top of it that the bag rips and the bin needs to be cleaned (again, by me). I'll come home late at night after work and she'll be sprawled on the couch, with the trash still not taken out. 
This has obviously led to some animosity between us. I work pretty regularly, and sometimes I'll leave the house and see it needs to be mopped and vacuumed, and while I work the whole day she is holed up in her room, I come home and nothing is done. Even something as simple as putting the dishes away when they've already been washed and dried. Sometimes even after an 8 hour shift, I am the one cleaning the entire house (kitchen, living room and bathroom) while she stays in her room. And I never even get one word of thank you. 
I don't like to confront people, and I have already reminded her several times that she needs to pull her own weight if she's living here. I think she can sense that I get extremely pissed off when she doesn't do her part of the household duties, so she hides herself in her room and only comes out when I'm in the bathroom or in my bedroom, which only makes the household tensions higher. We rarely talk, and when she does come out of her room she looks obviously depressed. Just total unhappiness in her face.
I know the depression is not something I can help with, I think even by mentioning the fact that she looks depressed to her will only sour the household relations even more. I know she will take it the wrong way if I try to offer her help. My question is, how can I make her pull her own weight in the house and help me with housework when she is obviously depressed? I don't like the current arrangement where I, as a 22 year old girl, am pulling the weight of TWO people rather than just my own. To me her supposed depression is not something that is excusable for a lack of performing half of the household duties. Am I just being to insensitive? How can I approach a roommate who doesn't even like to talk to me about this?"	not depression

 Nothing bad has to happen. It is a medical condition, and imbalance of chemicals in your brain. Your sadness and pain is all valid.

But the honest truth is that there is something wrong with you. And while there is something wrong with you is not abnormal, you are not alone and please dont make yourself do this alone. Your brain is a lump of meat sitting in chemical soup, of course its going to get confused sometimes and send out the wrong signals or none at all. Just like you take medication for blood pressure or diabetes antidepressants, antianxiety, and antipsychotics are all valid medications. People who have depression and anxiety are often seen as weaker, when in reality it is entirely the opposite. They are the strongest, most empathetic people. Please do not be ashamed to get help.

During this time I always feel so uneasy because there are so many people who have genuinely good mothers who love them and the advertising suggests that if you get your mother a present or whatever it shows how much you love her or whatever.

I have antisocial personality disorder, anhedonia and emotional numbness. I have never had any friends and I don't care about anything. I don't care about my mom, my brother, and my grandma. I am incapable of being happy excited hyped horny mad motivated and I almost never smile. Money lost its value for me and I am never grateful for anything. I haven't fapped in almost 2 years and I wasn't mad in almost a year and a half either. I never had any friends and I was always lonely in my house. recently I have made posts about me wanting to kill myself and feeling like i'm going crazy. now its stopped because im just feeling empty now, but one time someone replied to me and said ""it will get better"". now I didn't think anything about it until now while I was showering, and I wanna say, fuck this. things will get better cause the present is the present and we gotta keep going. We don't know what will happen and in the future do we? we gotta keep going and not do the opposite. no, I am not motivated i'm just thinking about the words ""it will get better"". know that there's a future and right now might be different in the future. I say that we all should keep going and try to get help, go to a psychologist whatever is possible. please just REMEMBER THESE WORDS.

dev_pid_2547	"A Comprehensive Guide on Slowly Getting Better, and Not Losing Hope. : In no way am I an expert, and in no way have I mastered these points, but I have had depression for about 4 years now, and I have seen what works and what doesn’t, and I wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. Depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but I believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub.
I write this because it makes me feel better, and because I like to help other people. It makes me less depressed. If someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, I will be happy and grateful for it. Being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves.
In no way are these ordered from most important to least.
In no way am I suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self-hatred. I do not see hope for myself, but I believe in it regardless. I hope you can too.
**Exercise Daily -**
Do something you like. It doesn’t have to be the most intense, fat-burning, crazy workout. All I’m saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. Go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. Try out the gym for a couple months, aiming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. Try going and being active a couple times a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. It can be anything from karate to chess (trust me, this actually burns a significant amount of calories!), from swimming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a Shaolin Monk
**Eat Healthy -**
We always hear this one, and for good reason! It’s simple, but it gets hard, doesn’t it? We want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. I’m not saying pizza is off the table forever, but I’m saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. Try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! Contrary to popular belief, healthy food CAN taste good.
Many depressed people have low levels of Vitamin D (like me) so I take those regularly alongside some Magnesium supplements. I believe overtime this will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical imbalance a different way.
**Take Meds If You Need Them -**
Talk to someone. If they suggest pills, try them out. I have had pills that swung me the right way (Lexapro), and I have had pills that swung me a very, very bad way (some green looking pill, I don’t remember what it was but I hated it dude). Everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. Just… try it. I know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pills for depression and taking pills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. Not a cure, but a step.
**Journal -**
This is a big one for me. I have kept up journaling ever since I was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. Writing things down (like this) has a way of soothing the soul, I think. Write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. Write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. Write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy; hopefully at some point.
**Clean Your Room -**
I suck at this, but there’s something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. Put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. Get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. You’ll feel better, trust me.
**Read -**
This is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but I do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. No, not a book that you hope will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. Read Matilda for all I care! I read that book in one toilet session and I felt GREAT the rest of the day.
**Go Outside Once a Day -**
All I’m saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the “funk” it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something.
**General Hygiene -**
Big one. This is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. You’ll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. Take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, trim your beard, de-odor yourself, whatever! You’ll feel slightly better if you look and smell better.
**Sleep Well -**
I’m talking 8 hours at night and not throughout the day. Don’t waste the day away by taking little naps all the time. Do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. You will feel better. You won’t be cured, but you’ll feel better. Your body needs this, friend.
**Wake Up Early -**
Again, this might not be for everyone (as a matter of fact, who IS it for really), but trust me when I say that almost EVERY TIME I wake up early and do some stuff I like, the rest of the day feels better because I did something productive at the start of it. I get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it’s great!
**Be Wise With Money -**
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect a lot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction.
**Compliment People, Spread Positivity, Without Expecting Anything in Return -**
This is a great one. Even if you don’t believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. Everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. Here’s the catch: don’t do it for your own gain. Do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. You want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise.
**Don’t Stay in Your House or Room for Too Long (Poor timing on this one, I know. But go for a walk or something) -**
This comes at an awkward timing, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. My worst days are when I’m just scrolling Reddit or Pornhub or Facebook and when I’m just… wasting myself away. Get out of your room, be productive, do something.
**Serve Other People in Some Way -**
This is a bit different from complimenting people, but the premise is the same. Help others. Join a non-profit organization and help out once a week. You meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. There’s nothing like it! You are DOING something amazing, even if it is small. You are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. Do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. This could REALLY change your life, as it has mine.
**Get Together With Friends -**
Get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. Whether it's at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, ANYTHING. Just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. This may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago (and all of high school too), but try it out. The right people will come, I’m sure of it.
**Call Family -**
Whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. It has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, disconnection, abuse; anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. But sometimes you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other.
**Listen to Music -**
Duh! We all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. For me it’s Coldplay and a little known artist named Chris Renzema. They have been with me through ups and downs (lots of downs). I also listen to William Augusto Instrumentals as I fall asleep each night. Very helpful.
**Try Out Therapy for a Couple Months -**
It can be scary, I know. And for me personally therapy didn’t even fully work out for me. But this doesn’t mean I didn’t try it. I tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because I didn’t feel any differently. This won’t be the same for everyone. At least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend.
**Limit Screen Time if you Can Help it -**
Less time on the phone, less time on the computer, less time on the TV. All great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? Find a schedule that works for you. I personally am trying to lower my screentime on my phone to 5 hours a day, and eventually to 2 hours. Small goals, one step at a time.
**Make Daily To-Do Lists -**
Most days, in the morning or the day before, I create a to-do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. I even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what I accomplished and so I can put a little checkmark besides it!
**Take Care of a Pet -**
I recently got a Bearded Dragon (his name is Henry), and it has given me something new to live for and protect. As someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. Many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. Send me pictures of them so I can tell you how cute they are.
**Be In Nature -**
I believe this is for everyone. Get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. Try to travel to a National Park at some point, and take in the sights. Go for a short hike and look at the trees. We are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it.
**NoFap, NoPorn -**
I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect alot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I’m telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction.
**Practice Gratitude -**
Stay thankful for the things that you have. Whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. Just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. Again, I do this too, so let’s get better together.
*Now, I am a devout Protestant Christian, and I wanted to include my Christian side to this equation. This is the most important part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason I am still alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step.*
**Pray (For Others and Yourself) -**
**Read The Bible -**
This is the thing upon which we compare everything else. This is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the Lord speaks to His people through His Word. Learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the One who Loves us.
**Meditate -**
Christians meditate too! Take time in silence and align yourself with the Holy Spirit, as He speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth.
**Get Together with Church Community -**
**Listen to Worship -**
Take time alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in Jesus name, or are still depressed this side of eternity and are still trusting in the direction of the One who gave it all for them.

dev_pid_2555	"PSA: With many companies moving to Work from Home due to Corona Virus. : This was post on fb by a friend of mine, I would never want to take credit for her words, but it should be here. Also, on mobile, hopefully the format isn't horrible. 
Many of us are moving to a work from home lifestyle for at least the next several weeks. This sounds like a dream to many of us. However, regardless of your feelings on working from home a few times a week, I want to take a few minutes to remind everyone about the impact long term work from home situations can have on your mental health.
Loneliness is already an international pandemic being recognized by countries as a major crisis. In fact, the UK has a 'minister of loneliness' dedicated to finding ways to minimize what is happening (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Cox_Commission_on_Loneliness) .
Mental health should be a top priority for everyone all the time. But with everyone restricting social interaction, we are heading down a potentially dangerous path. 
I urge you to take this weekend to do a few things to set yourself up for success. My suggestions are thus; take them for what you will.
Tidy Up
Find the area you will be doing your work, and make it neat and tidy. Clutter will cause you to feel stress, and is likely to make you think about all the things that need to be done around the house. Minimize the clutter, lower your stress.
Divide Your Space
If your only work space is near your bed, do what you can to divide your spaces. Long curtains and room dividers are a blessing. If you can't do this, consider working from your living room or kitchen table; somewhere your brain already associates being active. 
Add Plants
Add plants to your space! I am the absolute WORST at keeping plants alive. The concept of a 'green thumb' is lost on me. However, even fake plants can correlate to a positive boost in serotonin. 
Time Outside
Take 15 minutes a day to go outside and let the sun get on your skin. Doing this 2-3 times a day has been scientifically proven to increase serotonin levels. 
Decorate
If you are like me and have a house that is basically just white walls, do what you can to remedy this. Having decor in your house, especially green decor, will make a marked improvement on your mood and your productivity. 
Play With Your Pets
We all love our animals, and (unless they are cats) they love us. Take 5 minutes every 90 minutes to play fetch, snuggle, or pet them. Not only will the mental break from work give you a boost to performance, but your brain will release hormones to help combat depression and loneliness. 
Schedule Time Together
Many of us are not going to be having visitors. However, if there are others in your household, make it a point to spend time with them each night. Whether it's eating as a group, playing a game, or simply throwing a ball outside, the human social interaction is crucial.
Reach Out
A lot of us use Facebook and other social media platforms to watch our friends and family from a far. This is nice when we have only a few minutes to scroll through posts and see what's going on with those we love. But it's more important now than ever to actually reach out and talk to people. Use Facetime, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, whatever you use to have as close to 'in person' conversations as you can. 
By taking a few small actions, you can create a huge impact on your mental health. I know that I'm no expert, but there are hundreds of studies, and thousands of articles on how each of these things will help you and your loved ones. 
Also, consider making a few of these things permanent changes for your lifestyle. Mental health is not something to be taken lightly. We all deserve to be happy. We all know it's hard. So let's do what we can to give ourselves a fighting chance."	not depression
dev_pid_2556	"Can't rely on myself : ""It's my subconscious. Remember? I can't control it.""  
Leonardo DiCaprio's character just takes the words right out of my mouth with that one line from Inception.  
Now, obviously movies can't be trusted to represent reality. But it perfectly encapsulated how I've felt about my existence and living in my own body for, well, as long as I can remember.  
I can't rely on myself. I'm inconsistent. Debilitating emotion comes in waves, half the time seemingly from nowhere. Yet the whole world needs you to be reliable. I can't trust my own feelings; I can't keep playing pretend half the time just to put on airs of being ""consistent"".  
Does anybody else understand what I'm saying here? I'm not strictly looking for answers or something. I want to make sure that what I'm saying makes sense; it's one of the big things I am going to tell my therapist. Thanks."	not depression
dev_pid_4137	"I Just Realized Why I do Poorly in School Moments ago : I’m currently a Sophomore in high school and have generally always had bare minimum/poor grades. For years my parents wrote it off as laziness because I seemed to do well on tests (usually A’s without studying). Last year I was diagnosed with ADHD, which would explain past problems with school so I started taking meds. This school year is the first I have taken my meds and am still barely scraping by in college prep classes, but tonight I had an epiphany as to my problem. I have always had a caring and supportive group of friends that have always been in honors classes, they all were nice, except for one. This kid (Let’s call him Joe) Has always been a consistent asshole by turning jokes against me, my friends against me, and of course ridiculing me for being in lower classes. It is unfortunately unavoidable since we hang out with the same people so I tryyy to be nice to him...as much as possible anyways. 
Sorry for the rant but TL;DR I think this asshole caused me to have depression

dev_pid_4138	"my libido is extremely low and id like to fix that so i can move to the next step with my girlfriend : im on an ssri, so of course my libido is basically zero. id like to move forward with her into the more physical parts of the relationship, im just having trouble. 
i think a lot of it is mental + the meds. i have trouble kissing her for more than a few seconds, even if theres a part of me that really wants to go more. its like i get so in my head about everything and so convinced that my meds side effects are gonna fuck it up that i cant actually focus on her. 
i have trouble getting aroused when im by myself, but im not sure that would be a problem if she was there? i dont know though because my fucked up brain isnt even allowing me to get to that point!!!

When will this end?"	severe
dev_pid_4142	I feel like I'm worrying my life away. : I've always been a worrier, but ever since I was about 19, (I'm 26) the worry has sky rocketed. When I get over one thing, then something else takes its place. they're things most people probably woudnt think twice about, but it'll send me into a full blown panic. There hasnt been a moment I havnt been panicking (except for in my sleep) for the past 8 years. I've tried meds, which only made my anxiety worse. I ended up taking 4 days off of work, because I suddenly became terrified of driving. I also recently took a few days off, because I was worried about the caronavirus. I've tried going to a therapist, which helped with the issues I was dealing with at the time, but like I said, new issues just replace the old issues as soon as I get over them. Also, therapy was just way to expensive. I've had people guess I was in my 40s. That's how much the anxiety has taken a toll on my physical appearance. I just dont see an end to this. I feel like I'm destined to live a life in constant fear. If it weren't for my family, then I feel I'd have left this earth a long time ago. I'm just existing at this point. Anyone else out there like me?	severe
dev_pid_4143	"I really don’t see any reason to continue living... : I recently found out that because of the medication I’ve been taking for the past 10 years, I’m at high risk of PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction), loss of emotions, Anhedonia, impaired cognitive thinking, lack of empathy, etc. Tbe risks are LONG-TERM, EVEN LIFELONG for some people. I take the highest dose for these 10 years as well, making me even more at risk.
I also could be permanently unable to trip on psychedelics, or even get drunk or high. Besides sex (and love, but that’s harder to get), tripping on acid was one of the most important things on my bucket list.
This SSRI BULLSHIT just reinforces my feelings of being sexually worthless, and just not being a human being."	severe
dev_pid_4144	"Scared to ask for medication from GP? : Hello,
I’ve been in therapy for a while, and my therapist suggested that I seek medication. My insurance doesn’t cover seeing a psychiatrist, so I’ve made an appointment with a general practitioner. I haven’t seen this doctor before.
I’ve been on various antidepressants in the past, and one in particular worked *far* better than others for me. It’s not a controlled substance, and has no potential for abuse. So I’m going to go into the doctor’s office and ask to be put on that medication again—simple, right?
Welp, I’m terrified. I’m afraid she’ll say no, think I am a drug-seeking malingerer, or just otherwise react poorly and not prescribe me the medication. Has anybody gotten medication from a GP before? Do I actually have anything to worry about? Anybody have any words of reassurance? It’s been ten years since I’ve been on medication and I’m pretty nervous about getting it.
Thanks in advance."	severe

dev_pid_4146	I've been on Paxil for 10 years and I almost feel like I want to feel depressed again : I've hard some hard conversations recently that made me realize I don't have a goal for the future, I don't care if I die, I'm just numb to the anxiety which is bliss but also meaningless. I care too much about everyone else to end it, but I can't find the motivation to do anything but work, drink and sleep. Has anyone else felt this infallible blissful rut? I fantasize about suicide a lot. That doesn't bother me. What bothers me is the retrospective recollection I have of my life and how it's impacted everyone else.	severe
dev_pid_4147	"My life story : I guess Ill start from the beginning...
I was born in late 2004 my mother was then 17 almost 18 my father was 32 and had no clue what he was doing with his life and no he was never reported for being with a minor but he was with another woman of around the same age of my mother at the time and my sister who is older than me by a couple months was born my mother imediatedly got custody of me as my dad did not want to get caught while in court around the time I turned two or three the other woman figured out about me and my mother and soon had my then youngest sister after divorcing my father my father was extremely abusive towards me only untill i was about 8
Around the time i turned 4 or so my now youngest sister was born from my mother to a physically abusive man who abused me and my mother and was eventually locked away for battery charges and last I heard is wanted in my state 
When I turned 8 I was diagnosed with ADD for those of you who dont know what that is its the opposite of ADHD pretty much im always tired and i was prescribed Adderall my mother who i lived with soon found a new man who in time also showed his true colors and was abusive to me and mother did nothing 
My mother soon started using marijuana and was cheating on her then fiance with our neighbor i was then around ten within the next year my mother was hooked on meth and I was then moved into her mother my grandmothers house leaving my sister behind not too long after that I was prescribed Zoloft for depression and ADD 
I am now 15 no longer on meds other than a couple assorted supplements for sleep issues and my sister is also moved in with us  i have better grades than usual and i have a girlfriend 
I didn't come here for support nor help i came to give hope to those that dont have it work through what is hurting and become stronger because of it i believe that we all can become great things"	severe
dev_pid_4148	"After suicide attempts I'm dreading going back to my job : Hey. I'm in a psych hospital at the moment and am probably leaving tomorrow. It was due to suicide attempts and chronic depression with all the dressings.
I work as a dog walker. Lots of days I walk dogs for about four hours, and most of them are reactive/agressive and untrained. Basically dealing with that helped push me over the edge and now I'm facing it again on Monday. Love the dogs but I don't handle tiredness or stress well at all. Because of not working for over a week I have almost no money  - a little cash (enough for a week or two of food) and 12c in my bank account. With dog walking I don't make enough to cover rent and my parents help me financially. 
I just don't know what to do. Thinking about Monday brings back all the despair and hopelessness but I'm terrified of telling my clients that I'm done. I have no qualifications, no specific long term career skills or experience and huge trouble interacting with people.
I just don't know what to do as if I quit I'll have to face a new job and no money until I find one. I was accepted to do a six month course in photography but need a lot more money to register.  
Just don't know what to do any more and outside of my dr and therapist nobody actually listens."	severe

dev_pid_4150	"Persistence is key... 🗝 : Hey guys. I (f25) have been struggling my depression and anxiety since I was about 13. I have been through most types of abuse that you can think of on a long term basis and had 2 nervous breakdowns/ major depressive episodes.
I am telling you because one year ago today I was made homeless, for the second time that month. I was *absolutely* failed by my family for the last time. 
I have been on anti depressants since i was 13 but obviously, they take some tinkering so lots of chopping and changing and no steady regulation until about 4 years ago! 
After my second NBD/ MDE my doctor tinkered one my time, giving me the maximum dose of my current medication and increasing my anti anxiety medication. This helped a lot! 
BUT becoming homeless and moving into a hostel, I hit rock bottom. Rock. Bottom. 
Suicidal thought so intense and strong but contracted by the immense love I have for my partner was torture. Like, *actual torure*. 
So I started seeing the hostel therapist. 
She gave me tools to start changing the way I think but to also go back into my memories and process past trauma. I don't know what really happened from there because my brain and subconscious seemed to just take over! 
So far we have: 
1. Regulated meds
2. Therapy
3. Coping mechanisms put in place in times of crisis
Sounds perfect right?! Like shit just *fell* into place?! 
**HELLS NO!!**
THINGS WERE SO TOUGH! The past year has been brutal! 
Speed forward to this week. Again, I don't know what happened as my brain has just been driving and *I've allowed it*.
I have been sluggish in the mornings *but* got a second wind in each late morning/early afternoon! 
I have been productive! I have left my flat! I have been wearing makeup, showering, doing my hair, going to the shops... ect. 
I was convinced I was going to eventually succumb to the torture of my brain and get so tired I'd just give in to the temptation of opening up my arms. 
When people say give it time, please try and be patient! Get frustrated, shout, cry, sleep in, leave the washing up/housework or whatever... whatever you gotta do to get through the day, do it! Because *right now* is **happening**. You need to take care you **right now You**. 
This post ended up longer than I intended but if you got this far, please remember, hard work isn't always visible. It can absolutely be internal and exhausting!! 
**Go forth and love yourself!**"	severe
dev_pid_4151	"Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) today. Also on Buspar. Could use some insight! : Cross-posted in r/anxiety 
Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) this weekend. Also on Buspar. Could use some input.
After being on Buspar for a few months, it’s helped my anxiety to the point where I don’t really have panic attacks anymore, and my general daily anxiety has subsided a bit. But I’m definitely not 100%. Even though the anxiety is subsiding, I still don’t feel ‘normal.’ In fact, I’ve felt “blank” for years due to anxiety and depression, my baseline is quite low. I don’t really know what it’s like to feel ‘normal’ or 100%. I’m just used to dealing with it day to day. I told my doc all of this the other day while checking how the Buspar was working.
When I look to my future, I don’t really see one. Not because I’m suicidal or anything (thankfully I don’t have those thoughts,) but because it just feels like I’m living day by day without much projection in my life. I go to work, go home, and my social life is really bland for a 24 yr old guy. 
The doc said that Depression is definitely comorbid with my anxiety (you don’t say!) and prescribed be Celexa. I’ve never been on an SSRI, the only med I’ve ever been on regularly has been Buspar. I’m a little nervous to start it, for some reason. I’m supposed to take my first dose this morning. Doc said the only side effect I’ll probably run into is drowsiness. She specifically chose Celexa because apparently it has less severe side effects when compared to Zoloft for a guy my age.
Anyone have some input for my situation? It’d be greatly appreciated!"	severe
dev_pid_4152	":) : idk if i have depression, tbh. all i know is i am worthless, useless, stupid, fat, and unpredictable. i think this all started when i just shower everyone with trust and love.
let me tell you something about myself. i was jolly, quirky, playful, and silly when i was a kid. i am friends with everybody in the class.
back to the story..
i met my childhood ""ex best friend"" back in 4th grade. were so close that no one could ever separate us. you'd see us having lunches together, have tutoring sessions together, playing together, and everything that normal child besties do. but everything changed when we met our 3rd best friend. they started to hang out much more, leaving me behind but i didn't mind cus hey, i'm glad that we have more friends to do everything with. all went well until 6th grade. my ""ex best friend"" started to get distant; like she would always try to avoid talking to me, having eye contact, or even sitting next to me. i got really sad that time. what did i do to make her avoid me? and that lasted for months. time passes by and graduation was approaching. we had a little kick-off party for the whole class. i was a bit hesitant on attending the party bc i was just not in the mood for anything but i went anyways. not bc the teacher said everyone should go but bc my mom told me to spend the last day of school with my ""friends"". so i did. and that wasn't pleasing at all. when i arrived in school my other friends immediately asked me if i was going to my ""(ex) best friend's"" pool party the day after graduation. of course i didn't know about this so-called pool party my best friend will held for her ""friends"". so they were shocked as i am. one friend stood up and told me something about me and my best friend's 3rd best friend from 4th grade. she told me that she's been bad mouthing me from the very beginning. j just fell totally silent at that moment ad my world began crumbling into pieces. 
fast forward, graduation was over and time for high school. i was still down the whole summer and i wanted to get away from people i knew bc i would think that they were all gossiping fallacies about me. so i decided, no. i want to go to a new school for a change of environment. but it was not what i expected to be. i had a hard time making new friends and with a span of 3 days, i quitted that school. then my mom moved me to a high school in our town where all of my elementary classmates were. luckily, they were based on the science oriented classes. and i was enrolled to an arts based curriculum. everyone was nice to me and i started to gain confidence again. until a group of friends bullied me for years. so i found refuge in food. i began to eat a lot when i get sad, or happy. all was fine until i gained weight and my body wasn't pleasing to look at anymore. and guess what, those bullies started to pick on my body a lot more. they'd be shouting ""walk faster, fatso. you're blocking our way"" and shits like that. so, i started to eat less thinking that if i'd be skinnier, everyone would like me. years went by and i did lost a couple of pounds. i found myself happy again. 
now, during my teenage years, my father would always have something to say to every action i make. idk why but i just thought maybe he's just tired from work. so i let it slide. 
but on december 2019, my crumpled up world burned into ashes. 
my father and i were sitting on the bench in the mall, waiting for mom to finish in the public restroom. he was complaining to me about the agency he was working at, so i just listened and told him that it's going to be fine. but then he uttered, ""i wish i hadn't build this family too early."" 
that made me stopped listening to him and those words kept repeating inside my head. so he regretted having us? having me? or this family? like wth? we were a mistake? is that why he's always hot-headed with me? 
shit happened and i couldn't take everything they were throwing at me. the pain was unbearable to the point where i would shiver every night while crying. sometimes, i'd just contemplate whether to take my own life or not. but then i thought of my mother. i wanted to give her a better life and make her smile more. i don't want to leave her first because that would crush her. so what i do is sometimes, i'd just grab the nearest sharpest object and cut my wrists. it was painful but it was good. it is so addicting that everytime the pain was too extreme i'd do it again and again and again and again until i can feel the pain on my wrists, not the one in my chest."	severe
dev_pid_4153	"I feel like I’m rotting. Don’t know what to do anymore... : 
I liked myself in 2015. In 2016 I had a big breakdown and was hospitalised. since then I feel like each year I’ve been slowly rotting away, losing every part of me that made me feel unique or interesting, just becoming nothing. I think my soul died. I feel like an evil, awful person every day and that the universe is going to punish me for something. I feel cursed and like I can’t set goals for the future because I feel so sure if I try to do anything with my life something awful will happen to me and ruin everything. 
I’m feeling pretty hopeless. At this point I’m honestly not sure what to do. I used to be very social but I find I’m extremely overwhelmed by everything recently and have been isolating myself a lot of the time to decompress. It makes me so sad that I can’t follow my passions but doing anything positive just makes me feel guilty like I’m not allowed to be happy and that I’ll be punished for it horribly.
I’ve been told I have OCD, Depression and anxiety. I spend nearly all day consumed with ideas that terrify me. I’m really stuck on my obsession with morality and good and evil. I’m afraid I’ve done awful things and forgotten about them or sometimes I have upsetting false memories that are hard to tell if they’re real or not. Trying to be a good person is very important to me and the idea of hurting someone kills me.
I’ve tried lots of different medications and some of them work for a while but then seem to stop. I’m on 90mg of cymbalta currently and it helped for a little while but not really anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have a psych but they’re busy so I only get to see them once every few weeks but it’s not enough. I feel like if I have any chance of getting better I need much more intensive help or a big change in medication or something. 
Sorry for the rant, I don’t know if I’m explaining myself well, I’m just sick of feeling like this and watching myself slowly disappear and rot away. I hope that reincarnation is real so that when I die I can have another chance at life because I often feel like this one is ruined. I cut myself for the first time in a few months last night and then immediately felt embarrassed and guilty.
I can’t keep going on like this. Does anyone have any advice of how I can start fixing things? I’ve tried so many times and it always just falls apart again and I’m so tired."	severe
dev_pid_4154	thoughts : had depression for 3 years now, but lately it’s really really getting to me. everything feels almost like a movie, nothing feels real anymore. i find myself having to faking emotions for people, happiness, sympathy etc. it is exhausting putting on a smile when you would rather be in your bed. i feel bad for the people in my life, i can never give them my full 100%. most times i feel like a burden to everyone, like they would genuinely be better off without me. I’d say drugs are the only thing keeping me standing. one day though, drugs will kill me. and for some reason im ok with that. i am super fucked up because i have that rotten perception stuck in my brain about life, about how there’s no point to life, and the second you die it’s like you never even existed; lights out.	severe

dev_pid_4157	"A life rant : I moved across the country with my boyfriend 6 months ago. His work wanted to move him and we saw it as a golden opportunity to see a new part of the world together.
I had just completed 2 years of an engineering degree. I was miserable. That 2 years took me 4 years to finish. Those 4 years were a rollercoaster of depression &amp; anxiety. I decided to ditch that degree.
Moving felt right. I didn't know anyone in our new city, but in all fairness, I didn't have many friends at my university anyway. My plan had been to complete an online degree and get a job. I quickly decided that doing a degree online was not for me, so I decided to start a nursing diploma. 
I'm a month into a 20 month program. I can't concentrate in class and the 6 hours of sitting in a chair makes me crazy restless. Days go by and it feels like hours. I crash in bed when I get home and sleep 16 hours a day.
Everything is going downhill. I've been switching depression meds over the past few weeks and I feel awful. I don't have a doctor that I trust. I know my boyfriend is stressed about my condition but he doesn't know what to do with me. I have no motivation to leave the apartment, workout, cook, clean, or study. I'm eating junk and gaining weight. I just want to not exist. I'm thinking about suicide for the first time since high school. I know I could never actually do it.
I just feel like I have all the tools to succeed right now, and yet I still just can't do it. It feels like every doctor I see, every person that knows about my depression, they don't think it's that bad, since I'm clearly showering, eating and not going to kill myself. They are uninterested in referring me to a specialist, even though the meds &amp; therapy haven't been working. They rush through my appointment and print off an Rx for another antidepressant. Or raise the dose of the current one. 
What the hell am I going to do. How do I stop being like this. I just want to hold a regular schedule of waking up, eating, showering, going to school, studying, working out, cooking. Why does going through those motions make me want to die. Or at least fall asleep. Where do I go from here."	severe
dev_pid_4158	"TRIGGER WARNING-self harm : I've been cutting for about 5 years now. I do it much less in the recent 2 years but all my scars that arent from the starting year are still  prevalent in my eyes but not far away. They're kinda white ish ahainst my skin so when I'm wearing t shirts no one sees them,not even my bff who are aware I have them.
My brother this morning was joking around w me and he grabbed my arm. I used to panic real bad when that happen but I just tried to be chill this time but he saw the near brownish colored  scars and said ,what is that.

dev_pid_4159	"Do you also get overhyped whenever you feel better? : Hey long term depressed guy here,
recently im really spending a lot of time and energy and money to get myself somewhat straight so i can live a life that i want. But as a result for the past 4 months i live on a constant roller coaster. I had developped some psychosomatic symptoms like headaches, fatigue and brain fog long time ago i guess as a getaway to avoid feeling whatsoever, but since recently i am all over the place. I can cry few times during the day because im tired and sick of myself and the world and especially coming back to the same states  of mind that feels so familiar  and everlasting. However i sometimes just click out of it (meditation helps a lot) but i end up at this somewhat overhyped state of projecting myself into the future how i will do all what i want and be like i want and learn what i want and suddenly things start to interest me and hope is alive. 
But. what is holding me from doing what i want   whenever i feel better is my lack of concentration and this overly happy feeling that everything will be alright. Like im too busy about thinking and projecting myself into the future rather than actually taking action, and if i do take action, i end up kind of feeling overly proud of myself like a kid who did something stupid that everyone could but still feeling special about it. i always feel like im everywhere but the present moment and its frustating and tireing and always leading nowhere else but to a dead end where the relapse is waiting. 
I was wondering do you people feel this too or is it my fucked up personality that is dictated by my genes or parenting ir whatever.
Thanks"	severe
dev_pid_4160	Birthday blues : It’s always around my birthday I get mad depression. It’s always either the week before or even the whole month. Birthday is on the 20th and I feel like I have nothing. I have no one so what’s the point right? , I hate feeling so hopeless specially when people usually are so happy and joyful about another year. Well I’m not. I could care less about the next year or the year after that. I got prescribed some medication, and I just don’t know how it’s gonna make me feel or how I’m going to react to it. I just want to feel normal and like I matter I guess. Nobody really cares and it makes it worse because part of me doesn’t. I hate being here. Just venting I hate feeling like this.	severe
dev_pid_4161	"I've kinda just lost interest in most things : Hi, I'm new here. I've never been diagnosed with depression, and I think I struggle way more with anxiety than depression. Over the years, however, I feel like I've been losing interest in life. I hate to complain, and I realize that my problems are tiny probably compared to most other redditors on this subreddit, but I felt like I had to get some of this out anyway.
Anyway, nothing really excites me anymore, and the only things I derive moderate enjoyment out of are EDM and weightlifting. I've been dealing with some shit in the past few years, including family health problems, social anxiety, addictions, etc... but I've acquired some coping mechanisms for these. However, I have no idea how to cope with a complete lack of interest in the things life has to offer.
The biggest issue I'm having with this lack of interest is figuring out what to do in school. I'm in my 4th semester at an expensive university right now with a major in Mechanical engineering and Computer science. I am doing ok in these, but I have very little interest in either and that's causing me to lose a lot of motivation and discipline. There's a chance I'm not interested because I haven't really committed myself to either/had professional exposure, but I don't want to be wasting my family's money on stuff I'm not passionate about. I have no idea what area of study I'd switch to either, as again, I have no other identifiable interests. 
Being stuck at home because of coronavirus has given me some time to think about this stuff, and I am trying to figure out what I should do. I wish I could just force myself to be interested in things, but I think it's a combination of anxiety, low self-esteem, and (maybe) depression that is preventing me from doing so. I was thinking of taking medication, such as prozac, but I don't know how effective that would be. What kind of course of action would y'all suggest for someone in my shoes?"	severe

I still deal with depression but it’s not nearly as bad as it was in 2018(my absolute lowest) sometimes I forget that even tho my emotional symptoms aren’t as present I could still be better.
I’ve kinda forgot how it feels to be mentally ok and stable. I forget that I can still take better care of myself even if ""I’ve been worse"".
I’m trying to become human again, making sure to shower several times a week, going outside and eating proper food. 
I’ve kinda just lived off instant noodles, grilled cheese, chips and snacks for a long time. I forget make proper meals for myself.
Anyway, I’m currently making myself some proper food and hope you all remember to care for yourself too.

dev_pid_4164	Relapse after 4 years : In the last few months I've felt myself relapsing, and theres nothing I can do about it.  It's helped me realise a few more things about myself, which is good, but as anyone here knows any upside is drowned by the negative.  In life I'm lost.  I have goals I feel like I want to achieve, but truth be told I've lost what it felt like to be passionate about something awhile ago.  At this point I just go through the motions replicating what I remember passion and energy felt like, while apathy eats away at whatever I have left.  My friends are to busy with there lives for me to bother them with my issues.  My family has never cared about my issues, and would prefer to pretend they and I don't exist.  Work is the same as you can imagine in the USA, you're a cog they use till they see its breaking and then they throw it away.  I don't want to harm myself and am not considering suicide, nor do I think I ever will again.  But I  can't do anything except invision this person I want to be and wish I was, everday knowing I'm not that person and seeing how unlikely it is I'll ever be that person.  I feel like I've become a void and now I'm consuming myself, and I don't have the energy or the knowledge to stop it.  It doesn't help that I got depressing news today.  A convention I was looking forward to, after finally finding out 4 days ago I would be able to go to, got cancelled because of the corona virus.  Sorry for my ramblings.	severe

dev_pid_4166	"Not sure whether to post in R depression R anxiety R social anxiety or R offmychest : I work in a cafe waiting on. Sometimes when I go up to tables, I can't say what I want to say, I structure my words completely wrong. This happens a lot when interacting with people I don't know well. The worst is when I'm asked a question which provokes an animated response, when they joke and I reply quietly, or with something that makes no sense. Very awkward for me.
I've started to notice that because I'm only working 1 day a week, I also do this with my coworkers. They don't often make conversation with me, since I inherently give off bad body language, I really don't mean to. I pretty much walk around with a guard either side of my eyes, always looking straight forward or as if I am distracted. I always have the assumption that the other staff joke about me, I feel like an outsider to the group (which also consists of returning customers). It's really difficult to fit in when I am like this.
I am very worried this is due to some unrelated events that have happened in the past. I think I am suffering from PTSD. 
I am hooked onto some thoughts about events that have been and gone. One of them involves grief, and without trying to get sympathy, is a very bad situation for someone to be part of. I will often use this thought along with others to conjure up a thought along the lines of ""If only other people understood"" - I think this is very bad, and I'm not sure what it implies for me. Maybe a personality disorder? Maybe I need to talk to someone about it? 
I wish I could be comfortable when I am not by myself."	severe
dev_pid_4167	"Caffeine alternatives to function albeit depression? : Hi! I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, tho my meds help me manage. The thing is, I'm pretty dependent on sources of caffeine to aid me in performing my responsibilities. The meds really work more as the shit that helps me get out of bed, but it doesn't extend as much to ""keep me rolling,"" especially with mentally-demanding tasks (as you know, our brains kinda bog down etc.). However, I'm trying so hard to get out of uni and shit, so I'm really doing my best to get everything done. In fact, I actually seem pretty ""high functioning"" because I do things that just helps me get shit done (assuming the stress isn't bringing out the worst of my MDD).
That said, would you have suggestions/accounts of things that keep you ""rolling"" to perform your tasks? I either go caffeine overload (coffee + energy drinks; going with just one of either isn't enough, has to be both) or just get depression naps. The latter doesn't sit well with me although it's really what my brain specifically ""needs"" considering the mental load my brain wears itself out from. I just lose 3 - 5 hours to those ""naps"" (this is apart from my lengthy night sleep) and it makes me feel emotionally shitty after that I've failed to do the task. 
Would just want to hear what you do to keep up because sometimes I get anxious that my physical health will start deteriorating (further) because of my horrible and excessive caffeine diet."	severe

And before anyone tells me to wait or sleep on it or whatever, that's what I've been doing for years and it has turned my brain into black rotting goo.

dev_pid_4173	"Starting and titrating up on medication - Advice for those struggling : Hello everyone.
Just wanted to give some advice to those struggling as they start medication for the first time or are increasing their doses. Since I had a very bad experience with side effects my first time using medication, I thought it would be good to share my tips for getting through this rough period as I try meds again.
Basically, I have three pieces of advice:
1) Go slow. Even if the doctor says increase every 2 weeks, for example, don't blindly follow that if you're experiencing bad side effects. Take twice as long if you need to. When I tried doubling my dose every 2 weeks like the doctor (and official guidelines) recommended, it was hell most of the time. Racing thoughts, insomnia, lethargy, drowsiness, muscle aches, etc. etc. My second go-around with medication, I took twice as long between increases and experienced only mild side effects.
2) Tiny increases. Many doctors (and official guidelines) recommend start higher than you may be able to tolerate. If the prescription is for 10 mg, don't be afraid to start at half of one-quarter of that dose. Same goes for increases. Many doctors and guidelines suggest making 50-100% jumps per increase. When I did that, again, it was hell. But I didn't know better. Don't be afraid to use a pill cutter and make smaller increases as you go up in dosage.
3) Divide doses. If you start feeling wonky after taking a dose, try breaking it up and spreading it out over a few hours for a few weeks until your body gets used to it. There are many who divide their doses into AM and PM, and some who divide them even further. If you're experiencing horrible side effects, you're less likely to continue using medication, and even if you're resilient enough to ride out terrible side effects, why torture yourself and put your job, relationships, and happiness at risk? 
Finally, just listen to your body. Even if ""experts"" tell you one thing, if you're feel like garbage when taking medication, go slow or go small."	severe

dev_pid_4176	Youth (teen) mental hospital cost? : I have been having frequent thoughts and consideration of self-harm and suicide and think requesting to go to a mental hospital for a bit might help. I’m desperate at this point because nothing has seemed to have been working so far. Countless therapy sessions, talks with my doctor, increasing and decreases my dosage of Prozac, I even got sent to the emergency room one time by my therapist so that they could take me to a mental hospital but deemed me ‘fine’ and sent me on my way even when I looked in the doctors eyes and flatly said ‘I have frequent thoughts of suicidal and yesterday I got the closest to ever cutting myself in my entire life’. The only thing really stopping me from talking to my parents, therapist or doctor about this is worrying about the cost for it happening. My parents already have to pay for so much shit that I’ve caused like my meds, therapy sessions, frequent doctor visits and that one emergency room fluke visit must have cost a shit ton even when all they did was give me a cold hamburger and took my blood. I only feel like it would be an even bigger burden which would only make me more suicidal honestly, which is a bit ironic since I’m trying to go to a mental hospital to get help for that. I’m from Georgia, almost 16 years old now. Do costs vary from area to area? If anyone has any experience with this, what is a general idea of what the cost would be. I have a job right now, so maybe I can save up for my own stay. I’m so desperate at this point that it might come to me just having to pay for it myself. That would probably take over a year honestly and I don’t know how long I have before I do something rash. I appreciate any advice with this, thank you.	severe

As of recent, I’ve been feeling a little meh. My life is pretty okay I guess. Married with an awesome daughter, cars, toys, house, so on and so forth. I was recently let go from a 10+ year gig with my previous employer, but we’re fine. I have a new job lined up. 
In hindsight, everything is great. But I constantly feel upset, suicidal even at times. It’s a chronic issue I’ll dealt with my entire life. I take anti depressants, and have been clean from self harm for a few years now. As of now, I’ve been self harming for almost 20 years since it started. 
I feel like nothing is enough, I’m not enough, and life just isn’t enough. Everything right now is great, major hurdles in my life have been completed or resolved. But every time I wake up, I find myself asking what’s the point, or why not make another cut, you’ll feel better. And I do, until I have to do it again and again. 
I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my spouse about this... I’m too embarrassed to tell any of my close friends either..I can’t tell my spouse because frankly, I don’t think she cares. Our marriage together is fine, I just don’t feel like this is something I can introduce to her, or really anyone I’m close with. Every time they ask about scars, I lie.

After talking to people with major depression resistant to treatment who have recovered, I feel like I wanna move on. They had severe depression which had no relief, but they recovered. I start to think, I shouldn't have any insecure attachment or codependency issues. I can move on like them, even if my appointment is postponed 2.5 months. The other part of me is thinking, can I move on from having an insecure attachment style to my mum? I want to be mentally stable and go overseas to work, go to the countryside, explore the bustling city. I want to ride scary rollercoasters again without getting too anxious. There is life outside a hospital and constant outpatient appointments. Probably black and white thinking. Its not an either or thing. I was so ready to move on, I managed to stay on for months on my part-time jobs, things were going well. Like I knew I got to a point where I didn't have serious self harm urges or suicidal ideation. I felt like I was healed by God too. (Christianity). I hated some parts of my past, but I loved some parts of my past: the clubbing, the rollercoasters, the events which I went to. I hated being bullied or left out or failing academically. But I loved it when I could actually excel in the modules I loved, and I could write about cool stuff. I was so ready to break away from the identity and labels people have given to me. But there are some events and situations which will bring me to feeling useless again. And stupid. Like accountancy or being in a social setting where I don't feel welcome. Like I feel, how hard is it to wait 2.5 months for the next appointment? Just live my life and do shit even if I don't have much of an income right now and wait for ncov to tide over before finding new jobs?

dev_pid_4183	My battle with depression. : Hi all. This is my first real post on reddit. I had depression when I was younger. Under 10 I’m unsure of what age I was. Fast forward to 2016 I met this girl let’s call this person Beth. and my whole world changed. We had to secretly date cause her mother hated my guts. Some bipolar thing. I’m not sure. Anyway we were together and I kissed her and we were each other’s first. All the things. She moved up to New York to get away from her mom. She left a few days after my birthday. May 1st. I went and visited her a few times. I went in October then March then she came in may for my birthday. A failed surprise attempt. I’m always on top of the small clues. She went back a week later. She drove down for the summer like 18 hours of driving. I’m from Mississippi so it’s a fair distance. She came down, and it was clear she was not going back. We got engaged lives together had dogs, horses, chickens, cats, snakes, gerbils. All sorts of animals. We had a falling out one day and it all went down from there. She called my dad abusive all the time. She never met him, and was just going off what my mom said. That killed me inside because my dad died of a heart attack and the dog at the house ate part of his face off. So you can imagine how that made me feel. We had fights. We would get physical. I would try to calm things down and she would always jab at my dad which set me off. Let’s just say I didn’t take well to it. I always tried to make it up. We would bite, and punch. I wouldn’t hit her as hard as she hit me. I know I shouldn’t have anyway. I was filled with anger. I told her all my triggers and weaknesses. She used them against me constantly. We were in school for 2 year degrees. This last December she got her degree. She crashed her car so I had to get up early to take her to class. (She had earlier classes then me) no problem I did it without a second thought. After that we were getting evicted (we had till June to get our affairs set in order) she left and was back in New York before Christmas. I got fired from my job after this as well. So my life was terrible at this point. Fast forward to the 9th of January. She FaceTimes me crying. Ugly crying. She had slept with a guy and came to me because I had been her comfort the past 3.5 years. That was the first night I cut myself. Not to really kill myself, but to leave scars to remind me to never trust her again. I went to my care physician and she diagnosed me with Anxiety, Depression and PTSD. (Cause of my dad I’m guessing) I got put on Bupropion 150xl. I take 2 a day. Before all this he said she wanted to be friends but then turned everything back on me. It was all my fault, and I was the problem. I loved this girl. Took care of her singlehanded for 3 months while she get a job, and In school. I fixed her car twice. So now here I am writing this post. Class is hard, and I’m having trouble. I’ve tried meeting new people, but it doesn’t work. I have 7 dating apps and nothing. I am very discouraged and lonely. I miss the dogs. A few weeks ago the one we got together got ran over and she didn’t even tell me. That hurt so much. Her cousin told me at 2 am in the morning. (Beth does not have contact. She blocked me everywhere) to top it off she got her new dude to text me saying “We need to have a talk” that was the most childish thing ever. Spring break just got extended and I feel as my world is just falling apart. I have no social life. Playing video games used to be fun. Now I just find myself laying in bed scrolling through Facebook or IFunny. Even these dating apps. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing at all. I got to my one friends house just so I’m not alone. I had to move back in with my grandma after all this. I had to move of of the house. Fridge. Washer/dryer. Hot water heater. Bed. Dishwasher. All the dishes and pots/pans I bought. Everything. It killed me to have to do all that alone. I’m not suicidal anymore. I’m just lonely, and need people to talk to. I’m sorry I’m advance for my spelling errors. I’m trying to make it by. My name is Joseph.	severe
dev_pid_4184	Medications... : Hi everyone, I just joined Reddit. As someone formerly diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder when I was 16 (I am 28 now), I was wondering what medication you have found that has helped you manage your symptoms. I've taken celexa, prozac, effexor, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, and seroquel. The one I've taken the longest and had probably the best experience is prozac, but it makes me terribly tired and sort of dulls me out. I'm on 40mg right now, but I'm feeling pretty depressed and hopeless. The current state of world affairs doesn't exactly help either.	severe
dev_pid_4185	"How many times until you found the right antidepressant? : I've been on Zoloft it makes me feel nothing absolutely zero. I feel numb and made me tired. It helped with my anxiety though a little too much. There are times I need to feel anxious, and this antidepressant didn't allow me to do that.
The one I'm on now is called Wellbutrin which is more of a stimulant (which is why I was switched to this one) but it makes me feel angry and impatient even though it's the one that worked the best out of the two. It helps with my depression greatly but honestly, is it worth it if I'm gonna be a ticking bomb? I feel like shit after I explode. 
I'm tired of fighting honestly. I never wanted to get on medication but I've got no other choice. I've figured my options are either this, an addiction to some drugs or alcohol , or suicide. 
I put aside my pride, and my preconceptions to get help but now here I am. Battling it out. Like most depressions some days are better than others but right now I'm so tired. It's hard. 
Let me know what medications have worked for you. Thanks."	severe
dev_pid_4186	Ahhh : I’m back on my meds and it makes me twice as suicidal as before. Just great. Also I’ve found myself thinking about my ex a lot more and it’s absolutely fucking with me. I want to just neck myself imma be honest. I’m so tired.	severe
dev_pid_4187	Depersonalization depression #autopilot : I have just recently learned that the feeling of auto pilot that I have been having is in relation to the depression that I’m having about adopting a child. my baby is due April 25 and I’ve been having a lot of issues with the stress of the homestudy the stress of getting the house ready for the child. About three weeks ago I started shutting down. I didn’t want to go out, I didn’t want to eat much, and I didn’t even wanna go to work. The last two weeks of the depression was basically being on autopilot. This is actually called depersonalization disorder. When situation gets too stressful your mind begins to cope with it as if it were watching it from a different perspective, hence the term autopilot   During that time I quit smoking and had to be determined to make some changes emotionally and mentally. I’m really big on not letting emotions control you because I believe our emotions lie to us. But the weird thing about it is depression is not an emotion it is actually a situational thing. When you’re depressed you don’t feel. I need to be determined not to let this depression to continue to hold me away from who I am. This was gradual. But more and more I feel like myself. Taking control of my thoughts and my situation. Thank you God for giving me Google and the mind to put two and two together.	severe

dev_pid_4189	"Rant: about loneliness : I fucking hate that I’ve been feeling like the loneliest person in the world because I literally have no friends or a boyfriend, I’m a fucking loser. I have one online friend who I’ve never met. I hate meeting new people because they always let me down. I’ve tried online dating and been stood up three times. I have bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and PTSD. 
I’ve only had two boyfriends and they only lasted a month. And that was in 2017, since then I’ve been single and lonely. I try to meet guys but either they lead me on or reject me. I cry almost every night because of lonely I am. I just wanna be in a relationship and fall in love because I’m 24 and never had a real boyfriend. I don’t want to be 25 and still single.

dev_pid_4191	"Relapse :  
God you make me so fucking livid. Just the mention of your name sends me into an anger filled spiral of grief and despair. It’s been 8 months since you broke my heart on that doorstep. And yet I can’t get over you. I’m crying and singing to a song that used to mean so much to us, knowing that I can never go back to you. So tell me why the fuck my heart still yearns for you? Tell me why, I still feel pain when imagining you moved on. Tell me why I can’t do the same? Tell me, just please tell me why we couldn’t work it out. Why it had to be so final. Why I run back to you every time you cut out my heart and throw it to the gutter. Why do I like me better when I’m with you? Why am I so broken?
Every time I get like this I try to write a song to help me feel better. I hoped in some cruel way I could make money off the pain. Be known for hauntingly beautiful but depressing music. I dreamed of seeing you right up front of one of my concerts, and being able to sing my heart out to you. So you’d know just how much you hurt. Petty, right?
Ultimately, I know I’m broken. And I’m trying so hard to fix myself. But every mention of you throws me back into that pit, drowning in my own foolish love."	severe

dev_pid_4193	Suicide attempt ~ nsfw : I've had depression since I was around 9 years old, and through out that time I've attempted suicide around 6 times. I've had bad suicidal thoughts through out the whole 2019 however I hadn't attempted suicide though out that whole period (but cutting was especially bad that year as a result).  Yesterday I swallowed around 20 pills mixed with 2 different types of pills, and went to sleep hoping that I wouldn't wake up in the morning. I didn't leave a note or anything and I factory reset my phone, I also properly cleaned my room and left some money on my dresser.

dev_pid_4194	"Anyone got any experience coming off citalopram? : Hi, I’ve been taking citalopram 20mg for the last 4 days now, but I am seriously regretting it. I haven’t eaten a full meal since I started as I’ve been feeling like I’m going to throw up when I even think about food. My anxiety has been at such a high level and non stop, I can only sleep for a couple hours before I’m wide awake and can’t keep still. My mood has been so low I spent the whole of yesterday in bed.
I was wondering if I would get many withdrawal symptoms if I just quit it straight away, considering I have only taken 4 tablets? I would make an appointment with my doctor but it’s the weekend now and I really can’t take another one and add another day onto feeling like this.

dev_pid_4196	My first time doing something like this : I've been struggling with depression for 8 years now. It really started when my grandfather died unexpectedly in his sleep. Let me add that my mom had me young so my grandfather was only 56 at the time. His death crushed me as he was honestly once if my best friends also . I saw him every single day including the day before his passing. To this day it still hurts so much. It has had a huge impact on my life I started drinking heavily. At 1 point the drinking was so bad I almost lost my girlfriend. I have since stopped drinking and me and my girlfriend are engaged but as I plan my wedding I get down bc I know he won't be able to see it. There's times where I just sit and tell myself I'm a fool to still be so depressed about a death from 8 years ago but I just can't help it at this point.	severe
dev_pid_4197	"I'm tired of hearing that my negative thoughts aren't true : I'm at the point where I don't even know what to say when I vent. 
CBT doesn't work for me because I know all of the things I think are true. Things really are that bad. 
I'm 21 and in need of dentures that I can't get, I'm a shut in, my last real long lasting relationship was years ago, I have no friends, I still live with my parents, I can't attract others attention organically and nobody puts effort into a bond with me because they don't think I'm worth it. 
I'm at a loss of what to even do. Every day I do the same shit and I'm so agoraphobic that I can't even leave the house any more. 
I'm in therapy and I've only had 3 sessions so I'm not really expecting results yet but I feel like I need deeper help than a once a week 45 minute session can give me. I need to be resocialized because I've literally been living in complete isolation for almost 6 years now."	severe
dev_pid_4198	"A Rant that I Made in 10/5/19 (Ive Gotten Better) : Why is depression even a thing? It's such a terrible thing. I makes tons of people kill themselves, sometimes without a reason. I had and still have depression. I know what it feels like or the general feeling of it. For me, it came out of nowhere. Maybe not nowhere but I dont know what caused it exactly. I can just guess maybe it was because I moved to a new state and am not a socialable person, so I just felt lonely or what. Or maybe it was because of my ""dad."" I honestly dont know, but I'm not here to talk about how I got my depression I'm hear to explain what it's done to me and many others. Some of the people I look up to have had depression like Suga (BTS) and Sultan Sketches. And mainly that's that reason I look up to them. They have lived through it and I hope I can to. Now a few days ago I broke. I cried and I seriously thought about killing myself. I've been better since then but still because of depression my personality got more conserved and shy. I mean I was shy before but never this shy. I avoid talking to people because I'm afraid I might do something they dont like or intrude on them. Like I dont want to make other people feel like being around me is a chore for them, so I just dont talk to others. I mean if I say something, I might offend them or just get to close to them just to be a third wheel. Trust me I've been the third wheel of many many friend groups. I would just be in the back following them and listening to them as they talk, but never saying anything. I have had some friends that I really connected with. Those great friends should be enough for me especially when I have such loving aunts, uncles, grandparents, and parents. But I still feel so lonely. I feel like I cant tell anyone about my depression because it would only burden them. You see I cant talk about other people's depression, but mine literally tells me I'm inferior to everyone, I dont deserve anything, and I'm always bothering others. This means I think thoughts about how this other girl is smarter than me and another person in nice than me. I want to die, but dont deserve that. So, I shouldn't pass on my sins to others and be peaceful when I'm dead, while they suffer. I dont deserve the peace. Lastly, the bothering others one means I dont talk to others because they dont like talking to me, I dont ask for help because that means I'm taking up someone's valuable time forcing them to help me out of kindness, pity, or just to help out their persona. Anyway I need to sleep. Oh yeah, so depression also made me depend on anime (wow such weeb) to essentially run away from my problems and or depression because it introduces me to another world for a few minutes and I'm only thinking about that world and not mine. This is why I gravitate toward books, movies, and anime that are action, romance, or sometimes comedy based. It also made me lazy (*lazier) by not giving me the will to do other things, helps (not a good thing) me procrastinate more because honestly I just want to go back to watching that amazing anime (I have an anime watched list. Dont judge) so I can be happier and forget about my problems. I'm such a coward, running away from my depression instead of facing it head on. That's probably why my depression left for like 3 months (not completely) then knocked on my door and said, ""Guess who's back??? Depression's back."" Anyway I have to sleep it's almost midnight."	severe
dev_pid_4199	How did you kept going for so long? : I'm now had maybe 1 a half to 2 years Depression and read post on here wear people wrote about time spans of 8 years and more and I'm just amazed how you could last that long.

dev_pid_4200	"I tried to killmyself, now feel even more lonely. :  
On  Wednesday night, I overdosed on Co-codamol and Citalopram, went  unconcious on my bedroom floor and my brothers found me and called an  ambulance. Woke up in A&amp;E trauma room with an airway tube down my  throat and on a drip. Stayed the next day and night on a ward receving  NAC treatment and spoke to a mental health nurse for about ten minutes. I  didn't want to go inpatient, so agreed to ""home treatment"" instead  (I've been inpatient before and fully hated it).
Turns out home treatment means a nurse came to see me at home for 15 minutes, spoke to me a little and then left.
Now I have an appointment with my CPN in over a week's time.
I'm  just sat at home feeling so alone and forgotten. My family and friends  speak to me still but it all feels so strange, like I shouldn't be here.
I  don't feel completely safe and don't have any plans to attempt  anything, and I do not want to go back to hospital. What options do I  even have now?
I find it incredibly difficult to open up to people and it takes months to start trusting mental health workers.
i  know that if I went back to hospital or rang 111 for my suicidal  thoughts, they'd almost certainly put me back as an inpatient on a  mental health ward. And since I don't want that, what else can I do??

dev_pid_4201	"Mirtazapine gives me extremely vivid dreams. : Psychiatrist prescribed it to me to help me sleep (I’m also taking Trintellix during the day). It’s given me extremely vivid dreams since the first night. Last night’s dream seemed so believable that I thought it was my reality. Waking up wasn’t alarming, but it was definitely something else.
When I have these dreams, it’s as if a tiny sliver of myself is still aware that I’m dreaming, but I still can’t wake up if I tried. Last night, I dreamt that I jogged into a bad side of town and I was shot multiple times by a gangster. Instead of waking up in a panic, I took the shots standing. They didn’t hurt nor bleed. I took the AR away from the gangster and I shot him dead, two to the temple. He didn’t bleed either but he did die.

dev_pid_4203	"I have bipolar disorder and a lot of chaos in my life because of it. : In 2017 a girl i had been dating for 3 years and i broke up. It was extremely rough on me. So rough, in fact, that i quit my job of 3 years, burned through my savings, kill my credit, and checked myself into a mental hospital for a few days. The doctor there diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and prescribed some meds.
I took the meds for awhile and jumped from shitty minimum wage job to shitty minimum wage job. I was only staying at these places of employment for a few days then id quit. I found the meds were just making my moods worse and i stopped taking them, and moved back in with my parents. I found a decent job that i held for 9 months and actually met my current girlfriend there. That was a hard time in my life, but i got through it.
Cut now to 2020, my girlfriend and i have loved together since july 2019 and we're really happy together. Recently ive been feeling the depression come back and i dont know why. I quit my job where i was making 50k a year to take a few months off. I burned through the little bit of cash i had in my savings and now have to get back to working. 
I have a job lined up, not a great job, but it'll definitely pay the bills. The thought if going back to work is crippling to me. I know i have to hop back to work to support my girlfriend and i, but it's a hard mental block fit me to get over and I'm scared I'm just gonna quit again. 
I went back to the doctor to try different medication, but after taking it for a month my girlfriend told me it made me paranoid and she didnt like who i was when i took it.
Kind of a subject change, but bare with me it's all relevant:
In july of 2019 i had just quit the job i worked at for 9 months. To pay bills i had to sell all of my guitars. Ive played guitar since i was 8 years old and was actually in a touring band for 5 years. My band isnt together anymore so selling the guitars was a no brainer, i had to support us. It was still one of the hardest things id ever done. I hadnt played in awhile and thought it wouldnt bother me too much, but it fucking killed me. 
I feel music has defined very much of who i am. In my band i played guitar, sang and wrote all of our songs. I felt attached to my instruments. My girlfriend is also a musician and has a guitar around the house that ive been rediscovering my passion on. I feel pathetic because i feel uncomfortable playing her guitar. She always says ""honey, we share everything it's your guitar too"", but, and i hope this doesnt sound shitty, i take playing guitar a lot more seriously than she does so i feel sad and awkward not having my own guitar.
She works at a national guitar retailer and gets a killer discount. She convinced me i need to get my own guitar again and i agreed, but the problem is we arent financially at a point where we can do that. She still ordered the guitar i wanted to the store and put it on layaway for a few months, but i dont feel like I'll ever be able to pay it off. 
My old drummer is coming home to visit in may and we are trying to get a show booked, but I'm scared for some reason it wont happen. We have a really good presence in our area cus we played here for 5 years, and again not to sound like an ass, but we always brought a decently sized crowd. Every venue in the area is booked. We decided we wanna play a show in our old studio, we've played 10 shows there, we didnt think our studio manager would care, but when we asked him he said ""I'll have to think about it"" which is fine it's his studio i totally understand that, but I'm still a little disappointed.
To make matter worse, we have to get half this guitar paid off before i can take it home. With only one month between now and the show,  my job not starting for another week, and all the bills we have to catch up on, it feels like I'll never get to play music again. 
My one creative outlet and the thing that means so much to me, i feel like I'll never get to do again. I feel completely hopeless. Of course the most important thing in my life shifted from muisic to my girlfriend and our small fanily of animals, so i feel guilty for trying to make my music a priority and all. I just sit and think about me and my best friends opening old shows with ""Tubthumping"" and the crowd singing along and having a great time and i just dont think I'll ever get to recapture that feeling again and ah fuck ive started crying as i type this out.
Sorry this post is so long. I feel hopeless and it's all over dumb stuff. Like who gives a fuck that I'll never play music again, or at least for a long long time. Who cares that i feel like i cant hold a steady job and dont know why. It's selfish of me to want to put myself first at all and i feel really dumb that i even typed all this out. I just dont feel like i have anyone to talk to.

I've been battling sevete anxiety and depression for years and have issues with meeting new people, whether it be to simply make friends or go on dates. I've been single longer than Id like to admit and can't find ways of connecting with people. All the friends I've made in the last 3 years since being hospitalized for depression have been online via video games, but even that amount is very small. I enjoy talking with them but it can only help so much. I rarely see or even speak with the people I know who live around me and it's starting to become too much to handle.

They got so angry at me for having a bad day. For not wanting to give them a reason that I just need to be alone. That I just need them to not mess with me like a child. That I just have fucking depression and have bad days sometimes. 
My mom knows I have depression. I've told her and she knows and I thought she supported me. But she's so angry at me for having a bad day. For not being happy. For not acting normal. 
I don't want to pretend anymore. And I'm not even allowed to have a bad day. I don't want to try anymore.

To all my friends- Thank you for shaping me to the person I was. You have no idea how each of your friendships mean to me and how they have touched my heart. I love you guys forever.
To S- I’m so so sorry I messed up and hurt you. You deserve light, you deserve happiness, you deserve so much more. I’m sorry that was not me. I’m so sorry my love was not enough. But, thank you for being the best friend and girlfriend I could ever ask for. You’re amazing and please never forget that. I love you so much.
I think that’s it. I really hope you guys get through this and not end up like me. I love you all."	severe
dev_pid_4209	Depression and the Coronavirus : I've had depression for a long time. I've yearned for death for a long time. I have responsibilities that I will not abandoned and so my yearning remains. If the coronavirus were to come get me, what a selfish relief. My desire would be sated without abandoning my post. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't roll over. No, I'll fight to do what's right until my last breath... but if it takes my last breath, I won't complain. In this way, depression has eased my concerns about the coronavirus.	severe
dev_pid_4210	"I feel completely trapped in my life and have no idea what to do any more besides just dying : I’ve been unhappy for a very long time. I think some of it is because my life circumstances are horrible and some of it is just because I have depression and a bunch of other chronic illnesses. I can’t really do anything about either problem bc I’m completely overwhelmed and I have basically no support. 
Whenever I try to address my terrible life circumstances, it backfires and they get much much worse. I’m in grad school and it’s absolutely awful right now and I can’t leave and when I try to talk to advisors, deans, ombudsmen, etc their “help” is next to useless, sometimes talking to them makes the problem even worse than before. I’m completely dependent on grad school for income, health insurance, etc and I’m so physically and emotionally exhausted that I don’t even have the capacity to look for a different job. I’m honestly so incapacitated by depression that I don’t really think I can work at all but I’m not even sure that I can go on disability right now.
I have a lot of health problems that are poorly managed and basically no support for those either. I keep telling my doctors that I feel awful and have zero quality of life and they mostly just ignore me, tell me I’m a hypochondriac and there’s nothing wrong, treat me like a human scab and talk to me like a house pet. My therapist and psychiatrist keep telling me how “great” I’m doing and when I ask them where they get this idea that I’m doing great they won’t answer. I keep repeatedly, urgently telling them that I feel terrible and they basically just tell me that I’m fine and I don’t need anything. 
I don’t know what to do. Normally when you’re having a problem at work, you talk to the people at work about that problem and they help you. Normally when you have a medical problem, you talk to a doctor and they help you. I don’t even have the support of my family right now bc they keep talking about how “great” I’m doing and how I’m “so much better.” Whenever I say that I don’t feel better, I actually feel worse they just tell me that I’m stressed and that I’ll feel better once I take a vacation.
How the fuck am I supposed to make my life better if ALL of my support systems are offering me no support? Everyone says “ask for help when you need it” when someone is considering suicide, but here I am repeatedly asking for help and being told I don’t need it and nothing’s wrong. How the fuck am I supposed to refrain from suicide if I’m literally trapped in a life that makes me miserable and no one will help me?"	severe
dev_pid_4211	I wish i wasn't me : I hate everything about myself, i can't seem to do anything right. I always say the stupidest things, i hate haveing ADD, Dyslexia Anziety, and Depression.

I look like such an idiot, i hate that i always look so emotionless, i also hate that i am not good at talking to others, i hate that other than my girlfriend i can't even seem to get/keep any friends, i don't even deserve a girlfriend, i didn't do anything to deserve her, im a fucking looser, i hate that all i do when not at school is sit in bed in my underwear, looking at YouTube videos or playing games.

dev_pid_4212	"Super Depressed and I'm scared. : So I've dealt with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager, I was diagnosed when I was 16 with depression, social anxiety, and general anxiety. I'm 35 now and I have spent all these years managing my Depression and Anxiety without medication. But whenever I feel myself slipping into that dark place I always get scared. Will I pull myself out of it again? How long will it take this time?  
My husband has been laid off from work for 3 weeks and we are trying to save money for something important coming up soon and now we may have to dip into our savings to survive because we don't know if he'll be paid for his time off. It feels like the world is falling apart around me.  
It's been super stressful and I feel so alone. I can feel myself sinking deeper and deeper. I didn't get out of bed for hours this morning and I only got up because my husband coaxed me to.   
Every single time I try to reach out online I get shunned. I'm in a Facebook group for highly sensitive people and I posted my concern there, the post was removed. I posted it in other subreddits. Post removed.   
I read all the rules and I don't see anything that I could be doing wrong but it just keeps happening and I for some reason just keep trying instead of taking the hint that nobody cares and I'm such a screw up that I can't even vent on the internet properly.  I have probably overlooked something in this subreddits rules (since I'm a screw-up and scatterbrain ) and so this probably will get removed too but I just wanted at least one person to see me...to know I exist. It's weird I want someone to know I exist but also have the intense desire to just isolate myself and implode. I know what to do, I know I need to go for a walk, exercise and do things that bring me Joy. I'm just finding it hard right now."	severe
dev_pid_4213	"Is it normal to want to be depressed again? : I am about 1.5 years out of a 2 year long major depression. During that two years I was anorexic (2-5 meals per week) and suicidal/self-harming.
I feel guilty for having happy thoughts and feel like it would be better for me and everyone else around me if I just went back to my ways of removing myself from life and never speaking."	severe
dev_pid_4214	"[SS] I’m currently going through a hard point in my life. One of those, “I have a good life, why am I sad?”. I’ve been here before, with more valid reasons. Angst (concern of future and present), has been developing into depression (concern of the past, and indifference). Scratching to stay above. : **looking for peer support, kind words, and help.** scheduling an apt with my therapist ASAP. 
This will sound scrambled, but. I don’t have it as bad as some people here. I’m not suicidal. Nothing horrible has happened to me. It’s more of that, subtle baseline sadness that you can’t shake.
 I'm just sitting here by myself bawling and the idea of spending time with people is so unappealing to me. And that's just not me. It's horrible. I had an anxiety attack last week where I came close to passing out and I hyperventilated- which is usual. But I just haven't been able to bounce back since. The panic attack occurred because I was attempting to build my core, as I was on schedule to have a surgery that would improve my quality of life on 3/25 (cancelled since covid19). 
I just feel like I'm drowning, but I have nothing to drown in. And I'm just continuing to try and try and try to pull myself out of it but I keep getting bogged back down like a fishing bobble. Things keep pulling me under. Nothing in particular, but nothing is bringing me pure happiness as it has before.
I live in an area that **has the most greyest days and cloud coverage in all of the US**. It’s just gloomy. No sun. On warm days, it’s still overcast. Typically I’ve combatted seasonal depression with welbutrin, vitamins and tanning. I have avoided tanning, as it’s at my gym and once again, social distancing due to COVID 19. 
Anxiety is in the air but in conjunction with that. Anxiety to me is the fear of the future or what's going on. To me. And depression is negative reflection on how bad things were/are. And I just don't want to see my friends lately, and have no desire to do so. And like, i like those people and I'm social to some extent.
I just feel like if I stop cleaning, or moving that I'm actually going to fall into staying in my bed all day depression. And it scares me how close I am to that.
And I feel even worse, because I do have a really good life with good people. I can't explain why I feel this way. It just feels like nothing is as bright as it use to be and it hurts. And I feel like I've been a bad friend to my close friends and I hate it. I feel like I haven't been available for them. I have pregnant friends, long distance friends, who all have reached out, sent me gifts and “thinking of you”. Countlessly reach our to me. And I reiterate, “hey I’m not mentally there today, but please don’t stop inviting me out. I appreciate the invite”."	severe

I touched on the obsessive need to control my environment, and how it drives
My fiancé mad, to never stop moving, relaxing, or taking care of myself- in the sense of things I enjoy.
I’m at the point where my fiancé is my rock. He’s expressed he needs to be able to take care of himself, too. So he can remain strong for me as I crumble. Plus I never want to go to the watering hole too many times and dry it out. I feel the same way about my friends. My best friend told me almost a decade  ago, “you only call when you have a problem”. I’ve since then never really call anymore when I have an issue. Sometimes. Plus I started calling for other reasons. For my family, I don’t want to give them more problems than they have. But they listen when I do talk to them about it. Just that feeling of being a burden. 
Here’s my obsessive cleaning issue that stems from it and drives my fiancé crazy because I’m a dick about it-

dev_pid_4216	"Anyone can relate? : Hi, I uh found this subreddit. Kind of wanna just vent since I don't really have anyone to talk too. People are either really busy, or arn't really interesting in anything I haves to say. I gotten used to it, being alone you know. Taught me to watch people, and learn emotions and such. 
However.. there comes that price of feeling of worth and self worth is not being there. Or having any real value to anyone really. I tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago due to PTSD, and years of just guilt and loneliness building up. I got that one friend and then lost that one friend because i am fucked in the head from growing up without any real social group to be in. 
I did get called 911 after my mother saw how many pills I took at once and me just drolling on the floor passing out. I was put in Impatience for awhile about 3 weeks. Worked with some clinician and I did felt like I was supported, and liked. All the doctors that heard my story, and my experiences. I was told I had a big heart, a very big heart. Which I have a hard time believing in because of the things I done, and the things I couldn't fight back on. 
I guess another big part of my feelings is that I could never forgive myself, i couldn't forgive myself for not being able to fight back being sexually assaulted, I often feel like it wouldn't matter since I am male, and males are viewed a invulnerable, but it simply isn't true. I remember seeing terrors of people's eyes, and alot of haunting memories that just fucks with me. 
Anyway i do hang out with this group at school and when I just vanished for 3 weeks. No one asked the question of what happened to me, it was like I was a ghost. It really got me thinking if I really mattered or not. 
I get people do care about me, and I am able to do great things. I get the crap, but... I still just wanna be able to have friends.. like actually friends that can try to work through my bullshit I am trying to work on. And accept me for who I am.

So I lay on the railway with some music and wait for the train to run me over. It came and I learned that trains have a very loud horn. I dont understand what happenned. I got off when it was like 20 meters away. I couldnt control it. It was against my will. When I saw the sunrise the next morning I was so angry, I wanted to punch the sky. And noone cares or knows.

dev_pid_4225	"New to Sub, but Not to Depression : I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression as a teenager. I've gone off and on treatment over the years. Currently on welbutrin, buspar, and klonipin with counseling. 
I've been with my husband over 11 years. Last year he was diagnosed in his 30s with severe ADHD. Last week he was also diagnosed with bipolar. We've been living separately for about 6 weeks. I haven't told anyone other than my counselor.
Obviously things were spiraling badly for us to get to this point. He never physically hurt me but was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive. It felt like only a matter of time.
I used to self harm and have passive suicidal ideation frequently, which my counselor is aware of.
My partner says he wants to get help and is set to start cognitive behavioral therapy and medication next weekish. 
This whole journey really started 2 years ago when I couldn't take his mothers shitty treatment of me anymore and our friend killed himself and I asked him to get counseling.
Now here we are 2 years later, all these changes and resources and everything still sucks so much. I can't even tell my family. They have their own issues and lives and are across the country.
Now another friend committed suicide over Christmas and all I can think about is what a miserable piece of shit I am with a miserable life and how nice it would be not to live it anymore.
I'm just really down over it all. I tried to be a friend to my partner but I think he just hates me. He lives in our detached garage and I don't know why he treats me the way he does.

I've broken and I cry, I can't explain this in english, but it's a that moment when you can't control your feelings, can't control you crying for hours. And you just being on that hard emotions and it won't stop. 
So I finally found one crisis hotline from other town. The woman who did pick up the phone. She was tired and I heard this in her voise. She sound like ""why you f*cking call me at 2am, I have a more interesting things that your problems"". I just can't breathe due I was crying, I start tell her what bothers me, why I feeling broken. And she even didn't try to calm me down. She just did everything, she did say everything to make me feel blame for this call. She did tell me something like ""you know what, there are people who in worst situation than your, and they don't cry"". That all turn me to past, when I was fourteen and no one cares about me, no one cares about my problems. ""You just feeling sad, deal with it, its a adult world, kid""; ""What f*cking problems can are you have? You didn't see the true life, you should stop complaining"". 
And I just found out that in my country no hotlines for people in depression or mental breakdown. No one can help if I will feel so bad in next time. And it's terrifying me.

Recently I seem to be having more bad days than good. I think it's the anxiety that triggers the depression.
Had to quit my job late last year cause of the anxiety. Can't seem to force myself to get another one. Don't want to. See no point in it.
I used to self harm, thoughts have come back to do it again but I'm pushing against them.

dev_pid_4229	"Fuck hope. : I’m tired of hope.  I’m tired of excitement.  I keep on getting excited about things in my life and I keep getting let down.  I’m just fucking tired of it.
For some backstory, I have autism spectrum disorder severity 2 (moderate), ADHD, a learning disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and a few other things aside from those.  The greatest hits parade.  I always knew I was autistic, and had this confirmed by a few psychiatrists, but never a formal diagnosis.  That is, until a month ago.  I finally managed to get an appointment with a great establishment that did assessments for free.  I walked in with just depression and anxiety on my official transcript and walked out with that whole laundry list.  None of it was a surprise, really.  After telling me the diagnosis, the Dr. expressed a lot of concern over how symptoms as severe as mine should have been handled starting when I was very young.  She had no idea how I had survived 26 years like this, and expressed that she wanted to get started with treatment ASAP.  I was super excited.  For the first time I’d start getting real answers and real help.  She said they’d get in contact with me about scheduling an appointment as soon as they could.  
A couple of days go by.  I’m still excited, I can’t wait to find out when my first appointment will be.  
A week goes by.  I’m starting to get upset and confused.  They said we couldn’t wait even a week to get started.  What’s wrong?
Two weeks.  I’m angry.  I’ve given up hope.  I don’t care anymore, and I don’t want to talk about it.
Finally, they get back to me.  And the appointment will be another two weeks away.  I was crestfallen.  But at least I knew when it would be.
Fast forward to today, the day before the appointment.  Finally, finally I would have the chance to talk to someone who understands me, I can be myself without fearing ridicule, I can talk to someone without feeling inferior.  I’m so excited.  Until I get an email saying all appointments are cancelled for the next two weeks because of the coronavirus.
Why do I do this to myself every time?  And why does it always happen to me in particular?  Within the past three years, I could count on a single hand how many times I’ve been excited for something and that thing actually even happened, not even taking into account whether it lived up to expectations or not.  Everything I get excited about falls through.  Every time I’m hopeful I get let down.  It feels like life is a kid crouched by an anthill on a sunny day with a magnifying glass and I’m its favorite ant to torture.
I’m so ready to give up.  I thought I was days away from starting my journey to getting the help and services I needed FINALLY, after 26 years of suffering, and yet even now, life finds a way to keep pushing the light at the end of the tunnel further and further back.  I guess I should expect them to extend the period they’re canceling appointments even longer than two weeks.

How does it feel work. I know where I live she cant directly prescribe them, so how soon will I get my medications? I know she wants to talk to my dad and see whats worked for him since he has depression as well and has tried various drugs.

dev_pid_4232	"When the medical system couldn’t seem to figure out what was wrong with me, I sort of gave up : I was odd growing up. A funny odd, that got along with most people. I had friends in high school, but kind of pushed them away because I loved hockey too much. I trained all the time, and looking back it was a great escape for me. I had such bad anxiety, but there’s no discrimination on the ice, and I was simply the best. I felt invincible. The only thing I wanted in life was to win a state championship, and I dragged my team to a good seed in the tournament my junior year. But going into it I got my first concussion. I played through it because my whole life goal was in front of me, then I got another one. Then my senior I got two more. Then in college I got one, and played through it until things got... bad...
So I have “recovered” from all my concussions and am now dealing with post-concussion syndrome in my junior year of college. My memory tested as severely impaired, I can’t put words to my thoughts, and my anxiety is stupid bad. I cannot even be in a car when I’m not driving, as my heart will literally be pounding the entire time. 
So the only thing I’ve ever truly loved is hockey, I cannot play that anymore and no coach likes me enough to have me help them. I’ve never built good relationships with head coaches, because I’ve always been so close to defensive coaches. I’m honestly a ridiculously smart hockey mind, but that means absolutely nothing once you stop playing. So now what I’ve worked on my entire life means nothing. I forget what I’m doing at least 4-5 times a day. I use Waze to get to places that I’ve been to thousands of times. I miss several doctors appointments and forget to schedule so many. My parents and siblings treat it as a joke because I look fine. I have limited skills for the outside world, and honestly haven’t cared nearly enough about finding an internship. I’m tired all day, in part because I’m depressed and in part because of my head. I can sleep for a long time... much longer than the average person. I was robbed at gunpoint earlier this year and literally forget what happened and the DA is constantly bugging me about that situation. My friends only liked me because I was fun to drink with. Now that I can’t drink they do not like me. I have found more friends that I’m more comfortable with, but telling them this a few months into a friendship would be a great way to end up with no friends. I have IBS so my stomach is constantly tossing and turning. The only thing that settles it is weed, but my parents would murder me if I ever got caught with it. I used to smoke fake carts, but now I don’t really because I’m afraid of vitamin E oil. The gym is my only escape because I can’t play the sport that I love. The gym is now shut down for Coronavirus concerns. Ever since I got home from break the only thing I found wholesome in life are my two cats. One I knew didn’t have a whole lot of time left, but suddenly took a major turn and looks like she has maybe a couple weeks. The other was supposed to live for like idk, five more years. Today I woke up and she has paralysis in her back legs. Like WTF. 
I just needed to rant all of that out. You can comment if you would like 😊. And tbh the only part of that story that is exaggerated in the slightest is me dragging my high school team. We were a lot better than I give them credit for."	severe
dev_pid_4233	"Lather, rinse, and repeat : I've really been a depressive since the age of 12 (now 25). In my late teens, my anxiety became too much to handle and I reluctantly jumped on the psych med merry-go-round. I used SSRIs for a couple years and experienced some benefit, though never achieved full remission. Due to the emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, among other side effects, I decided to quit. 
~ 4 years later, I'm still fucked up from the drugs. I suffer from anhedonia, decreased libido, head pressure, among other symptoms. The original anxiety is still present -- perhaps more so -- with an additional later of drug-induced depression added to the mix.
I've been trying to live as ""normally"" as possible with thes lasting side-effects, but I'm effectively faking my way through life. I'm in graduate school to kill some time, but I enjoy very little. Everything feels full and meaningless.
Every time I wake up, the first thought is ""not again.""
How many times must I repeat this draining, joyless day?

dev_pid_4237	I can't go on like this : I stopped taking medication over 4 months ago. My mom cleaned my apt last month because she was trying to help me and took away the remainder of my pills in fear that I might choose the easy way out again. I guess she was right in doing so. Anyways, I have been feeling really low lately and I looked up my refills and turns out I have 1 more refill for a couple of medications. I know it's not wise but I plan to go tomorrow to get those refills, not because I plan to get better but because I really need a way out. I'm just tired....of everything.	severe
dev_pid_4238	Why do I do this? : Little backstory to give you an idea, I have dealt with major depression and anxiety silently for many years until it lead to a suicide attempt almost a year ago. I went to therapy throughout the summer until I went back to school and haven’t been to therapy since. I really liked my therapist and I want to go back. The other night I wrote out a whole list of all the things I’ve been really struggling with since we last talked (it’s a pretty damn long list lol). I wrote out the list so I would remember it (pretty bad memory loss from depression). After completing the list I told myself I would tell my mom the next day that I need to go back to see my therapist. Instead I just went on without ever telling her and not planning anything. I have to tell my mom because therapy is expensive and insurance doesn’t cover it (what a joke) so I would need her help financially. I don’t know if it’s the financial burden I feel like I’m putting on my mom or that I’m just afraid to bring this up to her and have her freak out that I’m gonna do something again. Whatever it is I don’t know why I can’t just do this because I know it’s what I need. And this is just another perfect example of all the issues going on in my mind. I don’t know, just needed to vent a little and maybe get some advice or motivation to help with this.	severe
dev_pid_4239	It's been over 3 years and I haven't healed : I loved a girl very much. Things ended not how I had imagined they would. It was like a worst case scenario. My life has been a nightmare ever since. I had already been through tremendous pain before in life, but nothing compares to the pain of losing a girl you love. It took me over a year to stop throwing up regularly because of my twisted stomach. I panic non stop because of this girl. I haven't talked to her in over three years. I think about her non-stop every day. This panicking gets worse on weekends. I always have a suspicious belief that she's having sex with other guys, when in reality I know nothing about her. This suspicion gets worse on weekend nights when people are more likely to be out partying. The jealousy of me wanting sex with her is insane. I'm still a virgin at 22. I wanted to lose it to her so badly. My life is turning into me living at home with my parents with no job for an eternity. I'm very smart and handsome. It kills me when I look at my face and think about how this relationship failed. I'm always told that girls like me, but I can't grow an attraction anymore.	severe

I was diagnosed with OCD, PTSD and depression 1 year ago and it's only been getting worse since then.
I live in student home at college not far away from home (unfortunately) and my mom calls me today and says ""Yea...your 'DePreSsiOn' is just your hormones during puberty. Tell your therapist to stop overreacting because I have enough problems with my life already.""...of course I hung up and took 2 pills because I felt a panic attack coming. 
I literally have NOBODY. My dad is abusive, egoistic man who doesn't care about anyone but himself and my mom. I have no friends because of social phobia and anorexia, depression etc...I guess they are all scared of me somehow. My grandma passed away, my grandfather is abusive too and everyone else is either dead or too far away. 
I am losing my mind and I need someone...I feel like attention seeker so that's why I always say ""I'm fine"" and shit but I'm not fine or okay...I started self harm again and I ended up on ER last week. I didn't tell this to anyone yet and I feel like shit.

dev_pid_4248	"I've been extremely depressed for the past year and the one thing I had to look forward to was my vacation, which has now been cancelled and I don't know how I'm supposed to handle everything anymore : Throwaway account because I'm too much of a bitch to post on my main.
I'm 20 years old, had to drop out of college after one year because I'm too poor, have been working an extremely dead-end job for the past six months and just don't know what to fucking do anymore.
I went to college for one year but had to drop out because I couldn't afford it. I have zero friends, and my job is overnights for 10 hours, four days on four days off and only pays minimum wage. I'm male and I work with five ladies who are all each over 40 so there's zero fucking connection between them and me. I don't have a car yet so I'm still stuck at this job for at least another couple of months until I can get one because I'm getting carpooled right now. My only friend moved to Mississippi a few years back and we've been growing more distant and hardly have anything in common anymore. When I'm not at work the only thing I want to do is sleep and I get very little enjoyment out of activities that I used to love, and on days I don't work it's hard to force myself to do anything. My parents are poor so they can't afford to put me on their health insurance and I can't afford it myself. 
The one thing I had to look forward to was a vacation to Portland that I've been planning for over six months, but now due to all this Coronavirus bullshit I have to reschedule. I can reschedule my plane tickets but my AirBnB was booked outside of the refund date so there's $300 down the fucking drain.

I was at a stage where the only thing that calmed me was knowing the end was coming, I was counting down the days. I cleaned out my belongings, I wanted to make things easier for my parents. 
With four days to go I panicked, what if I wasn’t successful? So many thoughts running through my head. A trip to the ER and I found myself in a psych facility. Diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, bipolar and PTSD and a mixed cocktail of medication I left three weeks later. 
It’s been five weeks since I was discharged and I still feel so fucking dead on the inside. I don’t sleep. I struggle to leave the house. I have zero interest in anything. I don’t function. I don’t know who I used to be before any of this, I’m lost. 
I need to see a psychologist but I the thought of bringing up some of the things I’ve been bottling up inside is terrifying. Past trauma consumes me, I want to let go but I just can’t.  
I don’t know what to do. All I ever wanted was for the good days to outnumber the bad, right now I don’t want either.

dev_pid_4253	It's not getting better : Just left a psych ward. It's been almost half a year now and it's not getting any better. It just gets worse as I keep losing hope really. I just don't see any light in the tunnel, I don't know what to do. I can only pray I die in my sleep.	severe
dev_pid_4254	"What do I even do at this point? : Long story short, 29 year old man, elementary school teacher, war veteran, severe depression and mild PTSD since I was 5 or 6 from prolonged childhood trauma, been in therapy half my life, failed 24+ different antidepressants as well as TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) therapy.  My life has been horrible throughout these almost 3 decades, but I've managed to make something of myself; I have a legitimate bootstrap story - grew up poor and abused, abandoned by my dad, joined the military to get away from all that, etc and still grew up to become the first homeowner in my family at 24 (this is a huge feat for American millennials).  I still own the same house, I drive a fun car, I'm very talented, I have good friends, and I have a good job.  I'm also tall and well-built, not bad to look at, fairly healthy and athletic, and have a full head of hair, all of which is a lot more than a lot of my peers can say.
And yet, I am in so much unbearable pain that I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  I finally beat alcoholism a few months ago, but I've had multiple suicide attempts over the last 10 years.  Literally nothing makes me happy and I am constantly fighting tears and aggressive suicidal urges.  I space out (dissociate) at work so much that I just got demoted for poor performance and have been caught staring at random people without realizing.  I am a constant source of worry for my friends and family, and I am a constant burden on my bosses and coworkers.  That's not the depression talking.
I've wanted to die for years.  I don't want to get married or have kids or any of that.  I don't want to work.  I don't want to go on vacations.  I just want to die so the agony can stop.  I don't want to hurt anyone, I just want the pain to go away.  The memories and the pain are just unbearable and living with them has rendered life devoid of dignity and enjoyment.  The tiniest things make me explode while the big things leave me apathetic.  I just don't care about anything anymore.
I go to therapy weekly, but I'm pretty sure my therapist doesn't know what to do with me anymore (I've had therapists and psychiatrists tell me that before).  I feel like something inside is broken or missing.  I can't enjoy life or connect with new people.  My only states of mind are annoyed and relieved.  I don't want to be here anymore and haven't in a long time.  But my suicide would destroy my mom, who has been through too much in life.  I can't do that to her even if I'm starting not to care anymore.  
What do I do?  Is it just always going to be like this?  I don't remember what happiness feels like.  I'm always either numb or so sad/angry that I want to cry but can't.  I feel like a ghost wandering the Earth, detached from this plane yet still connected by a snagged thread.

dev_pid_4260	"My Depression Complexity : Here’s my horror story: 
My father was never in the picture. At age 7 my mom had a new boyfriend and from ages 10-13 he sexually harassed me, molested me, and verbally abused me; calling me ugly, etc. When I told my mom, she kicked him out; but I suppose my child subconscious hid the fact that he shortly after came back. I’ve been suffering depression ever since. Low self esteem, antisocial behavior, miserable. It wasn’t until my late teens that I’d remembered what happened and why I was like this. 
Fast forward to age 25- I suffered a mental breakdown once being severely depressed for months. I was in a manic state for about a months time. Hospitalized twice within that month. A time in which my subconscious decided to reveal something else eating at me. I remembered that At age 11 I’d sexually abused my half brother which was 7 at the time (he has another father) I feel sick. I feel like a monster. I also realize though that this was a result of the environment I was in but can’t help but blame myself anyway. 
My mom is still with my “stepfather” and they have two sons. Brothers whom I have to pretend I’m okay because they don’t know what he did to me. Everyone that knows pretends it never happened. While I suffer silently and feel as if under water slowly drowning. 
Im now 28. I’m a single mother of two children. What on earth do I do? The world seems to be crashing in on me."	severe

dev_pid_4262	I’m trying to scale down my depression naps. : I have chronic depression, and it makes me sleep A LOT. I usually sleep about 10 hours a night and then I nap up to 5 hours a day. My therapist and I have been discussing this and we want to work on scaling them down. I’m excited to try it, but the only problem is I have an extremely hard time trying to move when I wake up. I’ve heard of people sniffing ammonia or squeezing a stress ball to get the blood flowing. Any suggestions?	severe
dev_pid_4263	"I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow, any advice? : After putting it off for so long I finally made an appointment with my local GP regarding my mental health issues. I'm 20 and have fit the criteria for depression since I was 16 I would say. I have experienced: Low mood, loss of interest in almost all activities I used to enjoy, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts (not often). The suicidal thoughts tend to occur more in the winter time, in the summer months I actually feel a bit better. I guess the main symptom is chronic apathy and hopelessness. 
It was rather manageable until October last year when I discovered some disturbing news that I was adopted and that my biological father was a serial rapist who raped my biological mother. After finding this out I feel I have become a little ""nutty"". My girlfriend became especially worried, as I would always pick fights with her and in her words ""become rather unstable"". I wouldn't say I have become delusional, but I now very quickly assume the worst in people and spiral into a very bitter place at the slightest wrong doing. 
I just want some advice with what to say. I don't really like talking about my issues with strangers, it just feels really uncomfortable - like I am somehow showing weakness. This applies especially as I am a man. Another thing that scares me is talk of antidepressants. On the one hand I feel I could benefit from such a medication as a tool to get things going again, however the side effects also make me anxious. The loss of libido scares me, mainly the horror stories I hear of it never coming back after cessation. However what scares me more is the emotional hollowness a lot of people describe, that when they do feel happiness its somehow ""meh"". I still feel really happy sometimes, but its very rare and temporary, and I don't want those moments to feel less special. I see these symptoms a lot online and on reddit even, with warnings that they will ""ruin your life"" and that you should only use them as a last resort. How true is this?"	severe
dev_pid_4264	"Ireven and venex xl : Hey. I didn't know where else to go to ask but is there a difference between Ireven 75mg and Venex XL 75mg? I know it's the same dose but I was on Ireven for the first month but I met a different doctor in the same practise to get the repeat prescription. I wish they told me there was a change because it makes me very anxious that I'm changing brands because the first three weeks getting used to the drug was so horrible I don't want to go through with that again. Sorry if this isn't to the usual theme to this tread, tbh I didn't read posts before asking so I'm not expecting much but Ty for reading this post because Idk who to ask x

dev_pid_4265	"Been trying really hard with self care, not feeling any better for it yet : TLDR:long term sufferer of anxiety and depression. Got ALOT going on in life atm Never been great at self care, been trying super hard with it for around a month. Lotsa hormones flying around everywhere atm due to it being that time of the month, plus on new antidepressants for 4 days. Dont feel like self care is helping yet.
So a little back ground. Suffered with very bad anxiety and depression for 30 years. I'm going through atm a tough and super busy period of my life atm where i am studying part time a very intensive course called access to criminology and law (its essentially 2 years of A levels in 10months), working part time at starbucks, planning my finacè and I's wedding, trying to lose weight so we can get ivf (need to lose 3 stone, stuck at 1 stone 12lb), look after our house, and be a good finacè and parent to my 6 Y/O daughter from a previous relationship.
Needless to say i'm stressed, i've started to recognise my symptoms, so i know before i'm gonna have a really rough patch where i cant leave the house i start to feel just numb. Things that should upset me etc, just dont i feel nothing. So i went to my doctor who gave me some anti depressants and a note saying please give me more time with my college assignments. 
I've never been super great at looking after my self, i frequently skip breakfast, wear clothes with holes in etc cas i dont feel like i deserve new, sometimes struggle to shower regulary. But for the past month or so i've made a real effort to shower at least every other day, i try and most days manage to brush my teeth and use some fancy face wash my mum got a while ago which really helps my skin (i dont think i've ever had a day where i havent had any spots). Sometimes i'm too tired and i think fuck it, but if i do that i make sure i keep it up the next day. 
I was super tired tonight but i forced my self to shower, wash face and brush teeth even though i was super tired. The whole time my brain was like i dont wanna do this, i'm too tired, bargaining with my self you've showered you dont have to do the other stuff. But i forced my self to do it, i dont feel proud or what ever but i'm hoping itll help my mood tomorrow. I dont even know if self care is helping me in the long run. Maybe its cas its that time of the month so theres hormones flying everywhere plus its only day 4 of new meds, but heres hoping it helps in the long run."	severe
dev_pid_4266	"I hate feeling good for a few days only to feel like shit the next. : I really thought I was getting better. I'm on 100mg of Zoloft since December and have been seeing a therapist since August who is just an amazing lady. I cannot express to you guys how much better these things made me. I exercised almost everyday. I restarted school and a new job and stuck with both (I have a horrible history of quitting everything because I just lose the energy and motivation) I was so happy.
But now, it's the same again. I thought at my new job people actually liked me, but recently just found out everyone is blaming me for everything going wrong (drawer shortage, bad review, truck not put away) and talk behind my back. I thought I wasn't that bad....I guess I thought I felt like I belonged. To make matters worse I have a crush on one of the managers. Rumor is he's screwing another manager but everyone thinks they're good together so it's okay. Last shift I saw him he pretty much bad mouthed me in front of my coworkers and then ignored me the rest of the day. I called in today after having perfect attendance because I didn't have the strength to go in.
My friend was starting to accompany me to the gym, which turned out to be the stupidest choice ever because all she does is flaunt about how fit she is, making me feel like crap. 
I don't know if it's the bad weather or not getting to socialize/go to school because of the Cornavirus. Or maybe my meds have stopped working again. I just want to die. I'm so sick of everyone acting like they like me until they don't. I'm sick of being happy only to feel like shit the next day and laying on thw couch all day just wanting to give up. I just hate this life. I just want something to actually work and actually work full time."	severe

I just don't know what to do, I only have 1-2 friends I can rely on but I've talked about this with them before and it's feels like I've exhausted my resources.

dev_pid_4268	I will kill myself : I was strugglling with my depression for years now and theres just no way out. At some points I thought it would get better, I thought I found a way out, I thought I eliminated the reason for my suffering but it is just that simple. I am the reason for my suffering. It is my mind, my attitude, the character I have become in the last few years, unfortunately without me really realizing it. I think it is just too late for me and I just want it to end. I do not know exactly when or how but it will happen and nevertheless it scares me. This is a feeling which I never wish somebody to have. Maybe this is the last post I will ever publish on the internet maybe not. The only thing that helps just a little bit sometimes is to come here and read about people who feel the same way, people who got the same fears, the same problems, which is of course a blessing and a curse at the same time. I just hope everybody here gets ok I mean here in Germany we say „Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt“ (Hope dies at least) but my hope died a long time ago.	severe
dev_pid_4269	"#RONASZN : Hey guys
I recently got diagnosed with depression and had my first therapy meeting a couple weeks ago. As many of you know, first therapy meetings don’t give you coping strategies, but are more of an introduction to what’s going on inside your head. With the coronavirus situation, I will probably not be able to attend therapy sessions for the next month or two. On top of that, my main coping strategy, the gym, is also out of the picture due to the situation. And even more, as a college student the job market doesn’t look too promising out of college. 
The whole entire situation has cemented the feeling of hopelessness inside me, and I feel like I’m almost getting punished for trying to get better. My mind is completely voided of any optimism, and “getting better” doesn’t seem achievable anymore. I just wanna know what some of you guys are doing to get through this situation, and especially my gym rats out there, how you are getting through gyms being closed due to “social distancing”."	severe
dev_pid_4270	Scared about my first appointment for Antidepressants : I have been in therapy for a few months now, so I’ve inquired as to getting antidepressants and I have to get a blood test first. I’m scared. Very scared. I’m scared that I’ll become dependent. That I’ll not be able to get more of my medication if the virus becomes worse. That I actually don’t have depression and taking the medication will screw up my brain.	severe
dev_pid_4271	"I’ve dealt with depression for over a year and i am seriously thinking to stop taking my meds : Life genuinely feels better now, my doctor told me to not stop taking the meds and you guys will probably tell me to do so, but life severely improved for me, my grades went from an average of 55 to 83 this session, i got a girlfriend who loves me as much as i love her, I’ve dedicated myself to things that are more important in life, limiting my videogame time, starting working out a couple months ago, started to believe in god again and i feel that god is sending me a sign to stop my meds. I’ve stopped taking them for a week now and I’ve been lying to my mother that i took my meds. Just wanted to share you this with you guys to tell you, there’s always a light at the end of the tunnel.
Love you all and I hope everyone that deals with that mental illness will get out of it one day"	severe
dev_pid_4272	I'm now 23 and feel just as awful as I did last year. : For starters not a single one of my friends remembered my birthday, so that one was rough. But otherwise, around a little over a year ago I quit my job (I have the luxury of not needing to worry about finances right now), and then a month later I entered therapy and started trying medications. Every medication of the 9ish I've tried has had no effect, and I mean none literally. I've also gotten absolutely nowhere with therapy, I even tried a couple different therapists this year, because I was told that if you aren't getting anywhere with your therapist it might just be because you don't mesh with them. It's hard to keep being hopeful. It's almost impossible these days to imagine a future where I don't feel so awful all the time. It's been a bad birthday, and a bad life.	severe
dev_pid_4273	"My uni just shut until at least third semester (end of april) : I have seasonal depression, this year has been extra bad, thought I was coming to the end of it.

dev_pid_4274	"I can't help myself anymore : I've been dealing with depression for 4 years now.. and in it's early stages when I'd get insecure about looks I was able to make myself laugh by screaming randomally ""if I had the chance to I would FUCK YOU!"" It made me stop crying and I'd be able to laugh my sadness off. I learned to hate myself because of people around me that got mad at me for small mistakes. Although I know it's because of them, I can't get myself to stop hating myself because of mean people. It became a part of me. It's like that piece of glass that gets stuck on your foot...and you step on it pushing it further and your skin just grows over it. I then met this guy that made me really happy, and he told me he liked me and I was going to tell him I liked him too.. The whole time he had a girlfriend. I found out through a friend and at first it didn't hurt me. I just went eh it's okay, but then I was going through a bad time and I noticed that I had to start every conversation with him, and that he steadily started ignoring me. We used to play games together, but I noticed he stopped playing with me and stopped talking to all his friends all together and only focused on his girlfriend which I understand. The problem is he started being meaner for no reason and questioning everything I said. I found myself sad again and crying daily for a total of now a month. I'm crying as I'm writing this portion, I thought he was a good friend, I thought I had someone to rely on when I'm sad. He helped me through a lot and we told each other everything. It's hard to move on and love someone else. It's harder to love someone when you can't love yourself. I've been having suicidal thoughts for three weeks in a row now, and I can't bring myself to ask for help from my friends. They don't take me seriously when I say something they just pass it off or tell me I sound like an eboy. I understand that, but it really hurts when you're begging for help."	severe
dev_pid_4275	"Needing a friend : Hey, I'm Ash. I've had depression for the majority of my life mostly due to my father's death in 2012. My anxiety and depression are hitting me really hard today. I just found out that my only friend removed me from her friend list on snap chat. I have no work friends. I'm not good at reaching out to people. I've done a lot of bad things and made wrong choices in my life, and now realize that I dont want to go on this journey alone. 
A little about me: I'm 26, birthday is July 20th. I have 2 kids and a failed marriage. I have a loving fiance that treats us like gold. I enjoy netflix and gaming. I'm a phlebotomist at a local hospital working overnight, so I'm a bit of a night owl. I'm in the kansas city, mo area. 
Just looking for some people I could reach out to in a tough time. Maybe go do lunch or have group dates. Or even just someone to reply to my ""I dont know if I can do this"" texts. Men, women, theys, thems, its, whatever. I'm accepting of all types. I just need a voice or screen name to lift me out of the water when I'm drowning. Please."	severe
dev_pid_4276	Finally going to start medication again : After waiting a few months, I’ll be back on an SSRI tomorrow.

It’s nice.	severe
dev_pid_4277	Lonely : Sometimes I get really lonely. I just want some attention is all. I can’t take this feeling. I have a great boyfriend but because of this Coronavirus he can’t even come over.

dev_pid_4278	6 years since I was diagnosed... : I just turned 20 a few days ago and it's hitting me that I've been depressed since I was 14. I just dropped out of university because I don't give a shit about anything. I feel like my whole life has been a waste and I have nothing to show for it. I've tried tons of medications, therapy, and inpatient treatment but I'm still like this. My self esteem and motivation is so low that I feel jealous of anyone who is doing better than me (aka all my friends.) Self comparison is ruining my life. I'm so bitter. It's so fucking frustrating being clinically depressed for years and never being able to change long term. Depression stole my youth from me and my life would have turned out so differently without it. I don't think anything or anyone can help me.	severe
dev_pid_4279	You know therapy is so weird : So many people go to therapy I do too but my therapist doesn’t really all help me all we do is talk about my problems and she tell me something I already knew just using bigger words. Why am I paying someone for something I can get from random people online oh wait that’s right my anxiety &amp; depression “solving pills” that come with there own set of problems but again I don’t really need a therapist for that my own family doctor can proscribe those so why am I wasting money on this shit it’s so frustrating the therapist is only really there to in a roundabout way tell you to solve your own shit in a healthy way. But who came up with what is healthy for me I just want to cut loose and break everything in her office smash every piece of glass and rip everything thing apart and maybe during that moment maybe if only for a small amount of time I will forget. Forget those around me that left or those that are dying that I can’t help or those who for reasons can’t even remember my name after knowing me my entire life. But that’s not a healthy way to really deal with my problems I guess or at least that’s what she tells me.	severe
dev_pid_4280	I really need to rant : This is probably what’s going through everyone’s head rn but I need to just shout this out into the void. This stupid virus has me at probably my lowest point in a LONG time. I’m in college, all my classes got moved to online I don’t do well online, the tests are done using a program that can tell if you’re cheating it literally just records you and even YOUR EYE MOVEMENTS and the professor can just watch you and that alone stresses me out. I’m TERRIFIED I’m going to lose my job because there is talk of closing down the school and all it’s services and GUESS WHAT I WORK FOR THE SCHOOL AS A TUTOR. And I have an apartment and I can’t just break the lease and move home with my family because that’s not a thing with student apartments they’ll just charge my co-signer which is my aunt and then she’ll be mad at me and never trust me again. And I’m obviously living in the apartment because I have to pay for it but all my roommates are gone and I have nobody which makes my depression worse. My mom was honestly worried I would attempt again but this time there’d be nobody to save me. I thought I would be okay here because I’ve been going to therapy and I was doing much better before the whole virus thing and I was making improvements so I thought it would be beneficial to continue that but I found out that they’re closed indefinitely because they’re also a part of the school. I feel lost and helpless. I looked into online therapy and it’s so expensive. My college is in a super small town so there aren’t many mental health professionals in the area and when you consider the fact that I don’t have a car there are even fewer to choose from and I would need to be able to talk to someone who can deal with my multitude of problems (anxiety, depression, and ocd)I just have so many unanswered questions and so much stress  and the one thing I was relying on is completely gone I feel lost. I guess if anyone has any recommendations for getting this therapy thing situated temporarily please let me know otherwise thanks for reading.	severe
dev_pid_4281	"Calls from the void : I have been suffering with severe depression since  childhood but the past 6 months have just been almost unbearable. I was contemplating suicide daily. I then moved countries but couldn't adjust, lost my relationship in the process, attempted suicide but rationally stopped and returned home immediately.
Between then and now I just can't stop the thoughts, every day I wake up to my inner voice convincing me to end it all. I can temporarily avoid it by keeping myself occupied but it is exhausting and I feel like im losing the battle. My anxieties are getting worse, my sleep is almost non-existent and the thoughts come to me the moment I am not busy. Quarantine is also forcing me to be alone with my thoughts which is making it twice as difficult. 
I have therapy but it isnt working and my Dr isnt willing to prescribe anti-depressants until I have completed therapy. Is there any advise for situations like this, how are people coping in similar situations, is this 'normal'?"	severe
dev_pid_4282	"Been depressed for a long time and not sure how to get out of it : I've had issues since my time in the service but they got worse after my wife admitted to having an affair and walked out about a year ago. I did the normal self pity party, crying, no sleep, barely eating, drinking too much, etc  (still kinda do that) but even after I started to wise up nothing seems to go right. Everything I do seems to backfire on me some way.
My best friend walked out on me, I left my closest friends besides her when I got out of the military, my family has always been the type where we don't talk about emotions, and the 2 people I've actually opened up to since she left ended up talking shit behind me back and laughing about me.
Job wise I don't really have any marketable skills in the private sector, cant find a job that pays more than minimum wage. I'm staying with family right now but I cant seem to save up any money because whenever I do something happens, either my truck breaks down or my ex is asking me to pay for her latest speeding ticket, her groceries, gas, etc and for whatever reason I give her the cash.  I mean I know why I do it, it's because I love her. We've had rough times in the past and when we were broke and barely scrapping by, there were days I didn't eat to make sure my daughters and her had enough.
I just want something good to happen or at least something I know how to handle. I've been applying for jobs with miltary contracters in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan so that I can at least have a decent paying job that makes sense (I've worked in factories, construction, private security, agriculture and had a hard time adjusting. My transition out of the service wasn't as smooth as I would have liked and was part of the problem with my relationship.)
So what the hell should I do? I've got 2 girls keeping me here and love them to death but at the same time I'm now anchored by my ex and more specifically her asshole of a boyfriend, who happens to live in an area with no jobs that fit my skillset at all. So I'm stuck being broke, unable to go after opportunities because I wont walk away from my kids. 
I've thought about therapy but no money for it and the VA is too far away to do it."	severe
dev_pid_4283	Had my first therapy appointment after a planned attempt. Suggested medication but have some concerns. : I’ve been kind of in the battle alone for the most part around 5 years. After a pretty bad breakdown where I had a plan to commit but was talked down (lashing out at the person and possibly ending that relationship) I decided to finally get help. Went in and towards the end was suggested I get evaluated further for medication since it’s gone untreated for so long and run rampant. I really love the idea that I could be fixed with some simple medicine but I have concerns it’ll change me in ways I won’t want. I really want to nuke the bad side of me to oblivion, but I don’t know if it’d be worth losing the good sides full potential. I’m really afraid I’ll just become a different person completely and lose my personality. Any advice testimonies or comments? Thank you	severe
dev_pid_4284	"Forced to quit Meds because of anxiety to call doctor.

I finished my Meds today. I need to call the doctor to ask her to give prescription but I just freeze when I need to call someone.
For 4 days I took 1/2 of my usual dose, and for last 3 days I took 1/3 of my daily dose. I know that I won't be able to call the doctor to get more Meds so I'll have to live like this for now.

dev_pid_4285	"How a near death experience worsened my depression : Trigger warning, very descriptive of my frame of mind. 
Last summer, after tubing at my lake, I was swimming around when I got very cold. I figured it was because I hadn’t eaten yet that day so I got out of the water and started to walk up the stone steps to my porch. I was still really cold but my legs began to grow so heavy that I couldn’t stand. I collapsed on the steps and my body was now on fire, bursting into hives that made the rest of my skin shrink in on itself. I remember my mom dragging me up the stone steps and standing me up next to our grill while she went to get Benadryl, I don’t remember fainting or hitting my head on the grill. But I did. I eventually came to half consciousness about five minutes later, unable to move, talk, or even hear. The heavy heat had lifted but there was this cold left behind. I felt so light and my nerves were coated in a sort of darkness that blinded them. I couldn’t hear anything but a slight ringing and some white static. Later, my mom would tell me my stepdad was shaking me and calling my name while she was patting my face. She also said that I was nearly completely blue and barely breathing, that she would have started CPR soon. She thought I was going to die. But all of that means nothing to me compared to what I saw. They don’t lie when they say there’s a light. Granted it wasn’t warm, nothing was actually. But it was beautiful. At first just the sun, but then after filtering through green leaves directly above me, it became this rippled net of picturesque peace. I remember thinking that if this was it, if this was how I died, after doing the last thing I loved, looking up at leaves, that would be ok. In that moment, I truly wanted to die. And it’s odd because recovery units and suicidal pamphlets tell us that we just want the pain to be gone. So much so that dying seems like the only way out. They make it seem like we wish for some paradise on the other side where chaos is nonexistent. But they’re wrong. Before this incident I was already diagnosed with severe OCD and MDD. Medicated for both. All the coping mechanisms. All the positive mental attitude. All the medication and therapy, couldn’t have saved me from death. They say none of us are meant to die at our own hands. I disagree. I think that some of us wander this Earth dying a little everyday, knowing there is no point. No end. So what of this one that people found horrific? Death was no end, it is completion.
I go back to this incident often. In some sick way it comforts me. The idea of being able to rest eternally after the war that is my mind. I don’t have a bad life. Many people would kill to have my life. And I still wish they could take it. But I’m still going, because I know that, one way or another, I’ll get there."	severe

dev_pid_4287	"Is anyone on remeron? (Mirtazapine) : I’ve been on 15mg of mirtazapine for 3 years now, I have gotten to the point where I am extremely tired everytime I take it, I can sleep for 18 hours. My psychiatrist ignores me everytime I tell him when I researched the pill it said that after a while on the same does our body gets used to it, if you don’t up the dose our body will get extremely tired. It’s almost like he doesn’t care, but maybe that’s my anxiety over researching, he is the doctor after all. I also am on a second antidepressant (trintellix) I want to get off the mirtazapine but last time i tried I suffered through discontinuation syndrome, it was so terrible. 
Has anyone ever been on mirtazapine? Have you experienced this aswell"	severe
dev_pid_4288	"It finally happened, my libido is gone : I've been taking Paxil (paroxetine) for a while now. Started with 10mg and now I've climbed all the way up to 50mg over 2 years, where I managed to find some peace. I tried going down to 40mg but my life got a bit disastrous so I went back up to 50mg. After a while, I was out of pills so I had my psychiatrist prescribe me more.
Except this time the pharmacy was out of Paxil 20mg/pill, so they gave me an equivalent medication of a different brand, which had a dose of 40mg/pill. I already have some Paxil left over so I'm using half a Paxil (10mg) + this Paxil substitute (40mg) for a total of 50mg of paroxetine.
For some reason this change made things better even though the dose was the same. It felt like I was taking a higher dose. I made sure to double-check the numbers and they did sum up to 50mg. But I started sleeping for 12 hours a day. I started feeling nothing looking at revealing clothing. I tried all kinds of suggestive images and I would get no response. It's as if I became asexual overnight. It really hurt my overall happiness because it was a way of stress relief for me.
This happened about 1 week after I started taking Paxil along with its substitute so I'm definitely sure the culprit is either the substitute or the simultaneous use of the two.
I know the internet isn't the best place for medical advice but I was wonder if someone had a similar experience. My next appointment is over 2 months later. Even if it was sooner, I doubt I would be able to talk about my sexual life because I'm single and I don't know what I'm supposed to say. ""Help, I can't masturbate!"" would leave a weird impression.
Anyways, thanks for reading so far. I'll keep taking my meds because I have no other alternative and I don't wanna get the brain zaps and other withdrawal symptoms. I just hope this lack of libido or SSRI induced ED isn't a permanent thing.
TL;DR: Took substitute meds, became a softer guy"	severe
dev_pid_4289	Idk what to do : All of this virus stuff is taking me for a loop when it comes to my extreme anxiety. I've been told by my psych teacher that I have complex PTSD from my childhood trauma, which already keeps me up all night, but lately I can't eat, sleep, or focus on anything. I'm scared to go to work or to go out but I make such low income that I can't just stop working. Working for a few hours feels like days, a full 8 hour and I have multiple panic attacks. I live with my mom still (I'm 19) and she works 70 hours a week in customer service and I know one of us is bound to get it because we can't just stop working. I'm mad at our government(US), I'm pissed off people arent taking this seriously. I'm worried for myself(diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and I smoke) and I'm worried about my family dearly.

1.abusive parents
2. I have 3 brothers and a sister... 2 brothers are so needy and annoying despite me being the youngest, same for my sister... I'm gonna talk about the last one at the end
3. I'm an atheist in a religious country, which means if they know I don't follow their religion ill be as good as dead
4. My job is so crap, the boss and coworkers are unfortunately even worse
5. No friends
6. No girlfriend
7. The only brother who cares about me died of an illness 4 months ago.
I was suicidal before he even dies, after his death im not able to function in anything...i just wanna experience peace for once since I was born, guess death was always a better option
I'm typing this as tears are running through my cheeks just before sleeping, since I have none to talk to in real life I had to vent here... When even the family isn't trustworthy its the moment that I made sure that I can't trust anyone who knows me personally.

With that since I was learning how to atart taking medication on a daily basis, I would forget on occasion and I would wake up in the middle of the night yelling and thrashing. I accidently hit my boyfriend in the face in my sleep. 
My doctor increased my dosage to 20mg about 2 months ago. After the increase, I started having these horrible night sweats which wasn’t happening before. Only the dreams on occasion. Now, I wake up several times during the night from sweating and nightmares no matter how low I keep my AC. 
Overall, I am doing a lot better compared to the way I was functioning before the medication, but the sweating is making me unable to sleep and keeping me up for hours. I could go to bed at 11pm and not wake up feeljng fully rested when I wake up at 11 am. I actually have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow and I plan to tell him about this of course, but I wanted to see if anyone else had similar experiences with Lexapro."	severe

dev_pid_4293	Dealing with major depressive : Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with major depressive? I’m 20 years old and I’ve had depression since I was around 13. Everyday is a challenge and I’m at the point in which I feel like I’m losing myself. My closest friends live in different countries and I’m emotionally exhausted from holding onto all of my problems without talking about them. I feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself, but my family would be distraught over me hurting myself and they’ve done a lot for me so I’m resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that I don’t feel anymore. - Cereal	severe
dev_pid_4294	Every day for the last 6 months I’ve thought of killing myself. : I keep waking up with an immediate dread having to be here. Nothing brings me joy anymore and the things that seem promising quickly turn into bitter disappointment. I dont want to go through the motions anymore. My life isnt objectively bad, but subjectively Im miserable and severely depressed. Ive never really planned on life past 30 and I dont want to grow old. I dont fit it anywhere and I’m constantly ignored by the few that catch my interest. My life is gray and I cant imagine a future where I’m truly happy, everything is so fake.	severe
dev_pid_4295	"I was told it gets better, 10 years later and it just got numb. : So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.
There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.
So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.
I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.
Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.
It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.
But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.
So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

dev_pid_4296	"Chronic Harm OCD sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice? : Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.
I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves."	severe

dev_pid_4298	"I tried to kill myself yesterday and wanna quit the meds, long post : So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"". Ive always been able to fight, its harder, yes, but i think i can make it."	severe

dev_pid_4300	depersonalization/derealization : I'm currently on Zoloft and Lamictal for anxiety. Few months ago I stated having panic attacks, but they resolved with zoloft. Yesterday something very freighting happened to me. As I was talking to my daughter's teacher I felt I was slowly disconnecting from the surroundings. I was forgetting where I was, who I was talking to. This horror lasted 2 hours. After I finally took Klonopin the symptoms stopped.  I'm relatively a healthy person. I will be seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is no other underling condition. Did this ever happened to you?	severe
dev_pid_4301	"I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me. : So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.
You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.

My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay.

dev_pid_4303	"Better days coming. : So I’ve struggled with depression on and off my whole life. I graduated recently and was lucky enough to land a pretty decent job. However, since I’ve moved and started the job I’ve relapsed heavy. I know it’s common for people to be lonely when making a big move and being in a new environment. I tried to end it all when I was in hs and told myself I would never go back to that place. I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I’m glad I did. I won’t bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. Well today i just got an offer at a company that I’ve wanted to work at since I started college! And best of all it’s back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I’ll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I’m hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month!
Btw I signed up for BetterHelp for my therapy. It’s not for everyone but I’m very shy and have had bad experiences with psychiatrist and counselors. It was just more excuses I made to not get help."	severe

I have no friends texting me, im just the guy in the group no one is best friend with but i still hang out. Im alone. Im lost. Im drinking again, dont know what else to do to numb the pain.

dev_pid_4310	"Where will I end up if I know I can't deal with life and don't want to kill myself. : I've suffered with depression my entire life and never did much to overcome it early on when I should have.  I will turn 30 soon and I have been addicted to porn since I was 12. I used porn as a safe coping mechanism so that I wouldn't have to deal with anything in life- improving social skills and having friendships, taking risks, developing hobbies, talking to girls and dating, going to college, traveling. Ive done none of these things. I've had a few menial jobs and have an apartment. That's it.
Now I have no job, I am a virgin and I have no friends. I just quit watching porn a month ago, but I am more depressed than I have ever been. This is because when I cut my coping mechanism being porn addiction out of your routine, reality hit me like a brick wall. Everything is bubbling to the surface and I am fully overwhelmed by the fact that I have completely wasted my young life. I see absolutely no positive reason to move forward. I have never felt this close to suicide being the only way out before. I am seeing shrinks about my problems and got put on meds recently this month. Therapy is not helping and you know meds just numb the pain a bit. They don't do anything to improve me without me trying to improve myself. But it's gotten to the point where I have no desire to improve myself AT ALL!! I can't get out of bed, can't eat. can't go outside. I have no passion to do anything. I know I can't commit suicide but I don't want to move or think. 
I've been in a crisis unit at a local hospital 5 years ago and it did nothing to help me. All they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for 2 weeks straight before they released me. All this did for me was numb the pain with medication and I was just as unhappy as I was before I went in. 
So my question is what happens when you don't want to kill yourself, but you can't deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? Is there a place where they will put you where you don't have to leave your bed? Psych ward or something?  I want to be put away forever. I can't deal with the uphill battle I will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. I do not have any strength left to improve myself at all. I do not want to be released from the care of others. Where do they put someone like me at his point. Any advice?"	severe

I hope my new antidepressants help because I don't know what I'll do if they don't.

I understand that depression meds intensify the effects of alcohol/marijuana.

dev_pid_4316	I was, and am, scared of getting better : Before I was out (I'm ftm) I was severely depressed for years, and was even suicidal for a while. I hated it, all I  wanted was to feel okay most days and when I came out, it was like a flip switched in my brain. I wasn't just okay, I was genuinely happy most days. I hadn't felt that good since I was 7 at the absolute oldest. In some ways, I felt like a completely different person; I became more empathetic, my grades went up, I had more motivation then maybe ever before, I completely stopped doing self harm, including pinching, which is something I started doing as a form of self harm when I was around 8, but I was still me in the sense of personality. For once, I truely felt like myself. That said though, the bad days became so much worse; I wasn't used to it, it wasn't my norm anymore. I'm still so grateful to have been able to experience that, to know what it felt like to function normally. When things first started to get better trough, that was exactly what I was afraid of. That it would be worse when things got bad, and if it got really bad again, I wasn't sure if I even would be able to recover. To an extent, I was right. Now, the period of constant okayness is ending. I'm having less and less good days, and it's awful. I'm having more breakdowns than I did when I was suicidal, and when it happens now, I almost always get really close to passing out, and that never happened before. I just want this to be over and I don't care if that happens because I get better again, of if it's because I get used to it again, I just want this to stop.	severe

This entire Depression feels like a parasite that is stuck with me and my body and no matter what I do there is no way getting rid of it. 
I can´t value myself and I´m self-critical to the extent that it could almost be self-hatred. Every time I get into a situation that could be good for me I avoid it, Persons that could be good for me I push them actively away until they don't want to be with me anymore. The cold realization that I missed an opportunity or chance comes unfortunately always too late. The feeling of not going anywhere in my life increased drastically over the last month. Especially the failed relationship with this girl devastated me. It was the first time in a long time that I tried letting someone into my life, with which I have big problems since my dad left years ago.

I mean I went to my University's student health and saw the psychiatrist there and got therapy through the psych service at school.
But this was my first seeing one not through a school. The kind with the leather couch and had classical music playing.
Anyway, I wasn't nervous like I said University blah blah blah. I went in confident just had to do the pre eval and just get my meds filled there. Well that's not what happened.
After an hour he sits back and I ask him how I'm looking. He said that he wanted to recommend inpatient. That was the first shock. (Idk why it was a shock I just never thought I needed it)
The second was after I told him about visual and auditory hallucinations (which I thought was normal because Uni doc didn't seemed phased). He told me he would right up a report but that I may have Psychotic Depression.
Now it may not seem like a big change from just having Major Depression Disorder, but idk.
Am I overreacting? Probably. I'm just tired now, I feel like everything that with depression would I'm just to lazy to type. I feel awful because my family cares and is supporting me and is doing everything they can. But I'm not fixed. I feel like I'm just a lost cause.

I've been depressed for about 6 years, little moments of hope and temporary happiness here and there when I briefly connect with people. But eventually my depression takes over again and the people I connected with start perceiving me differently, I've been told by a lot of them that I become too negative. Not really my intention it's not like I'm choosing to be sad all the time. The other thing that has been keeping me going is being good in school, up until last fall I was in graduate school which in hindsight wasn't really a good idea because that's when everything started getting worse. Because of additional stress and my inability to make any friends.  I failed 3 out of 5 classes and got dismissed from my school, was too embarrassed to tell anyone including my family so I just shut down and attempted suicide by taking pills, obviously it didn't work. I knew it wasn't the most effective way but I was just done with everything and didn't have another option at the moment. I don't think therapy is going to help me, yes venting sometimes feels nice but it's not going to change my perspective about life, I've never been an optimistic happy person. I don't see a happy future for myself,  I'm not attractive at all, not really in shape, apparently not as smart as I thought I was, no one is ever gonna give a crap about me let alone love me. I'm just not lovable. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if I was a completely different person with people in my life who actually love me and care about me, it's like day dreaming. And sometimes I pretend that my pillow is a person who loves me enough to actually sleep next to me. Pathetic and borderline crazy I know. It just keeps hurting because everywhere I look I see happy people, happy couples, people with perfect lives and I know I'll never have that"	severe
dev_pid_4327	"Zoloft dose : Hi everyone! 
I just got diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my doctor prescribed Zoloft. Her recommendation was to start taking it at 50 mg the first week and up the dose to 100 mg from then on. 
Not gonna lie, I’m a little worried about the dose. I see that a lot of people are starting out as low as 10 mg. This makes me feel a little worried that my doc’s recommendation is maybe too high?
Just looking for opinions or maybe a reference before I jump into this. I’ve never taken antidepressants so I don’t know what to expect and I’ve heard horror stories about the side effects that make me second guess taking medication."	severe
dev_pid_4328	"Advanced therapies and memory loss : I've had depression for years.  I have Ehlers-Danlos disease which is absolutely cripplingly painful physically, and pretty much ensures my brain chemistry will be screwed up for the rest of my life.  My depression will be severe and will never end.  This is not a ""your life temporarily sucks but could get better"" depression, but a depression I was born into and am basically fated to for the rest of my life just because the way the disease works.  It fucks up several systems of my body and there's very little I can do about it.  I've done the basic drugs, i've been for the behavioural therapy, and I might as well have been eating tic tacs.  Now the doctors want to go for electric shock therapy but warn me that I might lose some of my memory as a side effect.  I spent nine years in university literally crawling to class in pain to get where I am now.  I don't want to lose any of my memories because all those times I spent in tears in class trying to make it through the hour before I could break down in agony would be wasted if I can't remember them.  I really would rather die than lose what's in my head, and that's what they're telling me I might lose with ECT.  If I lose my memories I can't work and I'm homeless, and then what use am I?  I'm feeling like no matter which I turn I lose.  What has been everybody's experience with memory loss and ECT?  I cannot afford to lose the nine years of science degree.  If that's in question at all, I'm not going to do it, just accept my fate and fade."	severe
dev_pid_4329	"Anyone else take Wellbutrin and if so do you get side effects : I weaned off Celexa and onto Wellbutrin because after being on Celexa for about 12 years primarily for anxiety in the last year or two my motivation to do anything has dropped so I wanted to find something that could better help my depression and improve my motivation.
I've been on the Wellbutrin about a month and a half and after the first 3ish weeks of which I weaned off the Celexa, by early to mid afternoon on most days I now crash with fatigue and exhaustion. Also get mild nausea, sometimes a long with the exhaustion and sometimes by itself.
Also I can't say the Wellbutrin is actually making a positive difference with my depression and motivation but I do sleep thru the night virtually every night which I didn't do on the Celexa. The Wellbutrin has also caused intense dreams but never nightmares.
In all honesty I am feeling more depressed due to the fact that I physically feel like crap by evening.
Really wonder if the fatigue and exhaustion is side effects from the Wellbutrin or if its withdrawal symptoms from being off the Celexa."	severe

dev_pid_4332	"Depression turning into Rage : I have to admit it. Sometimes my depression explodes into rage. It scares me how angry I get. And after the explosion of rage I become even more depressed. Because well I was just a horrible person then I cry about it. And honestly, saying sorry does not help. And it pushes people away from me. It scares me so much that I self isolate. I don't want anyone to know what an ugly person I am on the inside.  Then I get angry because no one wants to hang out. It's a stupid vicious cycle. And I sit here and cry which does nothing either.
I've been in and out of therapy for my depression and rage for over 20 years. Nothing helps. I was originally a psychology major and actually have a masters in professional counseling. I left being a counselor because I stopped believing in the ability of it to help me and others. Well that and I worked with abused children and this made my depression and rage reach heights that I had never had before or since.
Counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, all of it does not help. I'm currently coming off my epilepsy pills. I've been told that it's possible that I am bipolar instead of just depressed. That my epilepsy pills might have been covering up manic phrases, I am scared because of this. I live alone. I live in fear that I'm gonna have a seizure. This is activating my depression which means I'm raging all the time as well. I just want the fear, anxiety, depression and rage to leave me alone. Why am I sio fucked up?"	severe

dev_pid_4335	"Nothing in my life sparks joy like it used to : I've had depression for as long as I can remember. But for the most part I was always able to see into the future and motivate myself to cheer up and get excited for what I can become. Even if it was a short period if satisfaction.
Although, for the past few months, I cant shake off this feeling of emptiness and sadness.
I feel so hollow and lonely and worthless. As I'm writing this I finally realized I probably need professional help but for some reason, I'm fighting myself over whether I should reach for help or not. I'm not comfortable with asking for help, I always love to be the one helping. Though I guess theres a small part of me hoping that someone would reach out, despite the fact that I try so hard to hide my true struggle with my emotions and act like I'm laid back and have no care in the world.
I'm always going against what I need. I want a way out of my counter-productive mindset. Its ruining my school/work and my aspiration to achieve what I want in my life.
A few years ago I was upset how I couldnt find any love interest. But as time passed I grew to realize that's not what I really wanted. So I took up some hobbies, which until recently also have lost their ability to give me joy. And even my long term life goals arent making me any happier. Theres nothing I want or hate. I'm just sad and empty."	severe
dev_pid_4336	Impulsive self harm : Hi everyone. I'm 24f and I have a mild personality disorder and I suffer from what I think is depression and anxiety. I'm not just depressed, though, just this morning I got inadequately angry for spilling water. I lift up from depression occasionally to feel other lovely emotions like anxiety, fear and already mentioned anger. Anyway, I have troubled relationship with my family, mother particularly, and I've been always overly attached to my partners and picked them so they would appreciate such a trait (high level of attachement) rather than get discouraged by it. My current partner is my greatest motivation to get better, but I don't observe much progress even after a year and half of therapy. Biggest problem is that he's been a witness to several self harming sessions of mine, because I'm probably seeking either for attention or help or both. I've read that most people who self harm cut themselves on arms and sometimes other places, but when I lose my mind I start frantically scratching myself, pulling hair, biting any flesh that comes near my head or hit-cutting with a knife and I have the urge to stab a knife through my heart. Has anyone experienced this? Also it happened once in a presence of my parents (very recently) and those are the last people I wanted to know about this. I have episodes of elaborated cutting or pinching to relieve the tension as well, but when I really get lost I honestly have no idea what is the purpose of those scary fits other than seeking for help or attention. How is it possible that I lose control so much?	severe
dev_pid_4337	"I’m so god damn tired.... : Hello... the title, basically. I should probably use a throw away but I don’t care anymore. I’m gonna warn this is mostly me bitching and whining, I’m really not that interesting.
To start, last year, my mom and cat died the same month. My cat actually died the week of my mother’s funeral. I was very, very close with her. She was he entire reason I went to college for a degree. My cat was there for me since I was a little kid, losing her was like losing a piece of myself... before I had a brain injury. She was all that was left to tie me to normality. Sure you could argue nobody is normal, but that isn’t easy to hear when you’re bullied relentlessly for being weird. I actually had to leave high school it got so bad.
To top all this shit off, I got denied disability for the second time, so now I have to wait another two years just to fucking hear no again. I submitted two fucking banker boxes of my medical problems, two!
I also need to deal with voc rehab since they helped me but I can’t fucking work with my disability, I’ve shadowed two different jobs and failed horribly. I barely finished college despite my longest day being 6 hours, with two of that being a break period. I feel useless and hopeless. I’m 25, poor, and draining my bf of his money. I just want to sleep and not wake up. Or have cybernetics let me have a cyborg body so my muscles and nerves aren’t as weak and painful as an 80 year old. 
I’m not going to do anything, mostly because I don’t even have the energy to attempt. But I’m also stuck in hell of struggling to sleep despite being exhausted all the time. I wish I was normal, I wish I wasn’t a fucking leach on society. I want to help so fucking bad but every doctor I’ve seen (5) has said I can’t work. Anxiety on phone, can’t do simple math, have a seizure disorder (so lots of places won’t want to hire me for that risk, they just have to claim something else to not be sued) can’t drive, and can’t lift more than 40 lbs. I also have pathetically low stamina, like the walk to my mail box wears me out. Yet the judge thinks I can fucking work.
...who knows, maybe I just have a victim complex. I know I’ve tried, but it still feels like I didn’t try hard enough, that I’m a failure, useless. This is with me on two different anti depressants that for the most part work, I’m sure without them... well... idk. It wouldn’t be good.

dev_pid_4338	How are you meant to reconnect with people? : During more serious depressive episodes, I will push people away and socialize way less than I already do. I can't find the courage to send anyone a message when I feel like I'm nothing more than an annoyance, especially when I don't have anything to actually talk about. It doesn't help that people really never message me first. It adds on to the idea that people don't care. I've lost friends in the past because of this, and I can see that I'm losing my few remaining friends now. With every day that passes I feel much more isolated and like the distance between me and everyone is growing. What am I supposed to do?	severe
dev_pid_4339	"Anti-depressants have ruined so many good things for me (24M) : I don't rant very often, but I'd like to share my personal experience regarding what anti-depressants have done to me as an individual.
I began taking Lexapro in 2018 because I had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. It took a long time for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. My anxiety has been terrible since I was a kid. I needed to figure it out. So late last November I switched to Prozac.
Worst idea of my life.
I started dating this wonderful girl who was independent and sweet and empathetic with me, which helped me sometimes feel like I could fight my mental health problems, but when the medication started ramping up in December, I started throwing and breaking things, and eventually we got into physical altercations. 
I have NEVER in my life been in a fight with another human being. I'm a small guy, I don't like confrontation, and I don't appreciate when people are irrationally violent.
Well, Prozac made me absolutely *violent.* It is still coming out of my system and I can feel it lessening everyday, but I still can't seem to hold down the  rage. I can't stop myself from having knee-jerk reactions to even little things like what I hear or what people say to me.
I am in so much pain because this medication isn't helping me control *anything* like my doctor promised. I'm going to start therapy in hopes to curb this, but I haven't had these issues since I was ten or eleven years old. 
Back in September I was happy, but anxious, and sometimes fell into depression, but I got out of it. I don't want to try anymore medication. I was perfectly fine just taking the hits and dealing with it on my own, but Prozac made me feel like I had no control. I still sometimes feel like I don't.
Props to my girlfriend (27F), for she hasn't left me while I struggle with this, but I'm feeling like an outcast too. I've slept on the couch for two weeks as punishment from her. I tell her how I feel and she says ""I wonder why"" and then tells me to prove I can be different. I just want this bullshit to stop! I'm so done feeling like this. I want the pain to stop and I just want to be me again."	severe

I barely go to school anymore. I feel too sad to go. I just play video games all day to forget everything and indulge in something fun. I do have times where I can say I feel happy such as watching anime, playing video games and working out (even though I barely have any energy to do so at times). I have low energy almost always.

Before I became depressed and still to some extent now, I would shower every single night without question or exception, rain hail or shine, I would shower before bed, and brush + floss my teeth at least twice per day, and usually washed my hands after using the toilet, I felt and still feel very dirty and disgusting when I don't do any of these in a 24h period, yet I've still become apathetic, and seem to forget to do it or not care enough and just take my mind off the dirty feeling and haven't been able to shake it even without a cloud over my head all day.

things have been going better recently for me. it's not the best, it could be better, and i still suffer from episodes from time to time. but tbh at least i'm still alive and got some will in me to live. i don't have much friends compared to a month ago and my grades could be much better if i wasn't so serotonin-deficient, but tbh, i'm starting to think of it as a good thing.

dev_pid_4349	"Prozac and my new life : I've never posted anything on here before, but I stumbled on this subreddit and wow what a relief. To see the out pouring of people sharing their stories is amazing. I've recently started on medication (Prozac 20mg) and let me tell you WHAT A GAME CHANGER. My thoughts are far more clear and the so much negativity is gone. My ability to think rationally now is so unreal it's almost euphoric. It's been about a month now and I've gone through so many changes with my mental health it is truly exciting and such a relief. However, as the days go by and the euphoria of this clarity dwindles I find myself becoming stressed over the flood of thoughts and positivity. I was wondering if there was anyone else out there that can offer some of their experiences or advice to keep powering forward and conquering this what I see as a second chance with mental health. 
 To give you some background on myself; I am know 30 and was diagnosed with depression at a very young age (6-7). Until recently I wasn't aware of that fact which was honestly a bit disturbing to hear. Also, on top of that, as it turns out, I was medicated shortly after being diagnosed and for some reason given the choice a few months later to stop the medication (idk what med). Naturally as a 7 or 8y.o I chose not to take it anymore. For as long as I can remember I was always that kid that had some sort of erratic behavior. Anything I did it was to the max. Every feeling and emotion was amplified and caused me to act out in a less than constructive manner. I had and lost countless friends because of my behavior and never really knew why. As I got older the confusion and heart ache of not understanding why I was the way I was turned a lot of the embarrassment into fear and anger. Once middle school came around I started to act out and get in a lot of trouble. By 7th grade I had been arrested for the first time and severed every friendship I had but one. I then went to a private school for HS where things started to get better and I was able to reinvent myself. I was in a tougher area with tougher people who could handle me and put me in my place when things got bad. The trouble continued. I was arrested again sophomore year and the outbursts only got worse from there. I now realize that I was a person who self harmed. I tried on several occasions to hang myself in elementary school, I would make dangerous and impossible jumps to send me and my bike off knowing I wouldn't lad safely in middle school, I ran/skated head first as hard as I could into people on the ice and on the football field sometimes knocking myself out because I like the way i punished myself, I enlisted as a grunt in the Marines to go to combat and hopefully be killed so I didn't have to do it myself, I failed in college, I failed in a construction setting, I became a firefighter for many of the same reasons as the Marines, I torture myself with horrific online videos, and worst of all I was self depricating to the point of immobility and almost suicide several times. Last year I decided to seek help because I was in a relationship with a person I thought was the one. Best decision I ever made. After refusing so many times out of skepticism I finally decided to take medication. It took two different meds to find the right one but wow what a change. I can happily say I've made significant improvement in my mental health and finally feel I can be happy. I'm out of a toxic relationship and into a brand new world. Does anyone share similar stories or want to hear more about mine to see if you relate? Open to any and all questions."	severe
dev_pid_4350	Is it depression or is it just me? : I have been depressed for all my life. I do not really know the feeling of happiness, I barely even smile. Of course, I learned how to fake it (like most of us?) because I didn't want to upset my mom and people around me. Ever since I was 8 I started feeling suicidal and let's just say I've been trying to end my suffering by trying to end my life. Well, of course I tried therapy, antidepressants, tried to change my life but nothing really works. Now I'm 23 and I've come to the conclusion that maybe it's not depression, it is just me. I was born to be like that, to be unhappy and suicidal. I lost control over my emotions, I do not have strength to fake it anymore (even when I know I really should to), so now I'm even crying like a baby in public places. I do not really have family other than my mom, I literally have no friends, no one is here to help me and.. believe me, I cannot help myself, I've tried. Do I even want to be helped? Damn. Now I'm just waiting for the right moment to kill myself. Probably after graduation, because I don't even see myself going to 9-5 job, I am too scared of people. Everything in me is just so empty. Nothing really matters. I should be removed from this world.	severe

dev_pid_4353	Never Been Suicidal Until Now : I’m a 19 year old kid trying to finish up my second semester in college.  Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.  A broke kid who got a 1570 on his SAT but could only manage to get a 2.1 in college and on the verge of losing everything I’ve worked towards my entire life, lonely and losing the one thing that made me happy.  I don’t really care if anyone reads this or not but I had to get all my feelings out because everyday I wake up and just cry.  Physically I feel awful, I’m lonely, I feel like a failure, and nobody is here for me to even talk to.	severe
dev_pid_4354	I feel like I was fired because of my mental illness : I got fired from my job yesterday because I missed 4 days of work from being sick, I even had a Dr’s note for every day. I feel like my boss used my mental illness against me too. About a month and a half ago I had a panic attack in front of my bosses and told them I was having a hard time adjusting to the job and told her that I was depressed and trying to cope. Today the HR person and my boss pulled me into their office and the HR lady said “So, you missed four days of work and you’ve shared with us that you don’t like working here, so we’re letting you go.” I was too stunned to say anything so I just sat quietly while they brought me the things from my desk in a box and walked me out. I’m incredibly angry, but relieved at the same time. I’m also scared and anxious because I’ve never had no income before and I’ve never been fired. I really felt like what they did was so cruel. I’m trying to think positive and push forward.	severe

dev_pid_4356	"Social anxiety makes me want to die sometimes : 
My social phobia started 5 years ago. My worst episode was when I barely left the house for half a year. I was rarely going out and if I was going out (when I really had to go to the pharmacy or hospital) it was dark (still early in the morning or late in the evening). I went to two groups for people with social phobia and individual therapy sessions with my therapist. It got better. It was so hard with the first group. I was getting strongest headaches because of extreme anxiety (I still get those) and had to take tranquillisers each time. I started to talk to people but just the ones who attended the groups. My social anxiety is still bad. Sometimes I am better. Sometimes it gets so bad that I want to die cause it’s so painful to live like this. I felt it yesterday. I really had to go to the mall to buy my partner a gift. It was a painful experience (I was constantly analysing my words and behaviour, my heart was pounding, stuttering). Then I went alone to the movies (I like horrors) and for 2,5 hours I was constantly analysing my behaviour and my words to the ladies who work in the store (I also have OCD). I’m anxious in public and sometimes I even have to take tranquillisers just to leave the house. I’m waisting my youth because of depression and social phobia. I wasted 5 years of my life. I know some people have it worse. But this is my experience. I just hope I will get better and start living."	severe
dev_pid_4357	Maybe some people are meant to be sad : After trying many different medications I'm starting to think that maybe its not that im depressed, maybe i just have a shitty life and should be sad about it and theres nothing to be done.

dev_pid_4358	"Do you ever get so deeply depressed that it actually scares the living s**t out of you? : I don't even know how to put this into words, but sometimes when I get deeply depressed, I have this feeling that everything is so god d\*\*n bleak and hopeless that nothing's ever gonna fix that and I'm doomed and everything's going to hell, I will never experience happiness again and maybe I'm going to get hospitalized because I'll be too depressed and unable to do s\*\*t and my parents are gonna sit next to my bed and cry thinking ""what have we done wrong??"" etc etc... and that scares the living s\*\*t out of me! So then it's not just depression but also terrible fear, that is, two huge problems at the same time and I feel paralyzed about it and whatever I try to do about it, like thinking more rationally about the situation, it just does not work as the feeling is too strong and I get even more scared because it does not work which makes hospitalization (etc) even more likely, and the loop continues. The only thing that ""works"" it literally doing *nothing* about it, just waiting for it to end by itself, and just trying to occupy myself with whatever I need to be doing at the time. That way I endure the least possible amount of misery.
The strangest thing is, this kind of deep fearful depression often happens for no real reason, like if I already woke up depressed and the day is bad to start with. Usually as the day goes on, the feeling dissipates and by the evening, I feel much better and often totally ""forget"" about the episode.
*I almost asked if this was normal... :-D*
*Note: This is my 2nd attempt at posting this. First time I used some common but offensive words like ""s\*\*t"" without censoring it and that didn't go well, the post was deleted. It didn't do it to be purposefully rude and offensive but more as a freedom taken to illustrate the seriousness of the issue. Am I allowed to say ""god d\*\*n"" or is that offensive too? Never matter, I'll censor that too.*"	severe
dev_pid_4359	"After struggling with depression for the last 13 years I feel like I've come out on top : This is the only place where I feel like people could possibly understand what I went through and I want to both vent and celebrate a bit.
I first started therapy for depression in 2007 when I was in 5th grade. What followed were years of therapy (13, in fact), multiple month-long stays in mental hospitals, a suicide attempt, tons of different meds (anti depressants and anti psychotics because I suffered from depression-induced psychosis at one point), an eating disorder (EDNOS), got diagnosed with social anxiety, I self harmed for years upon years and have gotten hundreds of stitches and staples throughout that time. I've written suicide notes over and over again, set myself end dates, contemplated my death thousands of times. I have a difficult family situation and have endured bullying in school for many years. I dropped out of University because of my depression. I truly thought that I would never, EVER overcome my mental illness even a bit.
Now it's 2020. I recently saw my therapist for the last time, though I've only met up with him about 3 times in the last 2 years anyway. I haven't self-harmed in about 1.5 years. Last time I took meds was about 2 years ago. 
Do I still feel down sometimes? Fuck yes. I dislike my job and still struggle with self-hatred sometimes. I still don't have friends. But on average, I feel happy. I go to the gym 3 times a week, I have hobbies, I can laugh and I can cry (used to be too numb for that), I read a lot and work on improving myself, and most of all - I genuinely want to live. I want to know what else life has in store for me. I enjoy being alive. 
If you've read this then I just want to thank you for your time and want you to know that there is hope for you even if you are just like I was - absolutely hopeless and thinking that there's no way to ever be cured from this."	severe

dev_pid_4363	"Wellbutrin and Paroxetine (severely depressed and exhausted) : Hey everyone,
I would really love to hear some first hand experiences, because I am in a terrible place right now.
I have suffered from depression for decades. I am currently taking 40mg Paroxetine for depression(about 4 years) and 10mg (3x) of dextroamphetamine(about 2 years, not everyday).
 If I don't take  the dextroamphetamine I suffer from severe lethargy, hollowness, lack of interest in almost all of the activities I am passionate about, horrible absence of sex drive and just a general ambivalent disposition about everything. The Paroxetine has helped tremendously with my obsessive thoughts, my insomnia and some aspects of my general anxiety; however, I cannot continue living life with this feeling of complete lack of passion and drive.
I don't want to be on dexedrine any longer as it's effects are dwindling and so I am thinking about trying Wellbutrin. I'm hoping that it will, to some extent, help with the lethargy and help negate some of the numbed feelings of Paroxetine. 
I understand that it is a DNRI, and I believe I understand it's pharmacological action. I know it won't give me the alertness that dextroamphetamine does, and that's fine. I just want to have my feelings of excitement, sexual intrigue, and interest in more than sleeping and staying inside the house. 
I know everyone is different, but please, has anyone went from amphetamines to wellbutrin and how was your experience? Any help would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I'm completely stuck.  Thanks!"	severe

I’m on antidepressants and I’m supposed to go to therapy but I’m not going because I don’t have the energy to do so. How can someone like me who’s so depressed that they have no hope of becoming better and have no motivation to get better actually get better. Or how can people expect them not to kill themselves when there’s no fucking chance of getting a better life.
I’m actually really mad it isn’t accepted to kill yourself. If in that way I’m gonna be happy then let me be. People who want me to stay alive don’t realise how much I hate myself and always will. I don’t remember a moment I didn’t hate myself. Just let me and the people who don’t want the “gift” of life die and try to see it as their sweet release."	severe

I'm starting to notice some of my signs of depression, including complete lack of motivation, minor things being overwhelming (hello laundry!), etc.
At what point is it reasonable to say that maybe my medication isn't working as well as it should be vs these are normal things after a break up? I currently just see my primary care doctor for prescribing, is it time to move to a psychiatrist? I am already seeing a regular therapist."	severe

dev_pid_4367	"I called three different helplines tonight : I wanted to end things tonight. I came incredibly close to doing it but chickened out. I knew it would fail and I’d have to deal with the consequences. I still feel so rough
I called the helpline given to me by the Adult Mental Health Team for their patients. I spoke to a mental health nurse. She told me this is expected because of my change in medication. She didn’t tell me how to deal with it. She said it’s my brain missing the serotonin and it’ll be ok soon.
I called NHS 111. They deemed it not an emergency since I didn’t go through with it. I’m ok with that since I really don’t wanna spend a night in the hospital waiting room so I can chat to a psychiatrist for 10 minutes. The call taker was very mechanical about things. She told me to speak to a crisis team.
I called my local mental health crisis team. They said I should speak to the Adult Mental Health Team helpline (the one I called first). They said I should take my meds for the night and then listen to some music. Just mindfully listen and clear my head.
It was weird. They all just decided the call was over. They never asked if I had anything I wanted to say. Maybe that’s unreasonable for me to expect. If I called three helplines and none worked, maybe I’m the problem. They were all trained healthcare professionals, not volunteers. It should have worked. I feel like a lost cause."	severe
dev_pid_4368	I hate everything about myself : I cannot stand who I am. I have nothing going for me. I’m not depressed, I don’t want to die, but I absolutely hate the person I am.

Last year I tried to off myself and I took 32,500mg of aspirin and instead of dying I destroyed my kidneys. I have type 1 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, PTSD, ADHD, and terrible anxiety. Everything in my life brings me pain and I can never have a moment of happiness. I know I don’t want to die, I want to live, but I don’t want to live being the person I am. I want to improve myself but all my negative qualities still stand true. My entire life I have always felt this way about myself. I just want happiness, that is everything to me. I don’t even know what to do anymore. I’m so bored of life and tired of who I am. I’m a senior in high school and I’ve skipped every school dance because I can never find a date or anyone who is remotely interested in me. I literally have no positive qualities about myself. Even if I’m not in pain mentally, I will still always be hurting physically. I have good grades in school, accepted into a good college, and am going to be a registered nurse. But what is the point of the future if my entire life is pain? It is all I know.	severe
dev_pid_4369	"Paralyzed from emotions : Its Saturday. Its a beautiful day out. There are things that I can think of to do and go.
I feel completely overwhelmed and paralyzed from my emotions. The past 2 hours I was laying in bed with my eyes closed trying to pass out or to stop thinking. I am constantly thinking of killing myself. I'm constantly thinking of what validates me to be alive.  I think purpose is self prescribed; but every day since I was young I keep hold on this existential shame and want to kill myself. I stop explainging that I'm upset to people other than just saying that I'm depressed. I wish that I didnt exist. I have been having disassociative feelings where I'm outside of my physical body watching a movie play in from my experiences for the past couple years. Things always feel like they get worse and more hopeless. 
I started doing things that I feel like are somewhat close to self mutilation but I feel too ashamed to describe to anyone. I started therapy a year ago because I keep thinking of killing myself and I begin to plan out how I need to do it to make sure it gets done instead of trying to find what good there may be in life.
I'm 33 years old. I see younger teens on here and some other ages too.  I have a lot of good things in life but they don't really 'mean' anything to me.  I have a job and enough money to live in a small apartment.  I don't feel like I have friends that I can really talk to and I get further from my family all of the time.
I'm just waiting to die everyday.  I wake up and fall asleep thinking that I shouldn't be alive.  When people describe to me what makes life worthwhile to them it doesn't make sense to me. 
I just want everything to fade to black. No more experiences.  I want to return to nothing - that's where I belong.  I feel like I'm crying but no tears come out.  Just this sinking inside of me and a soft shudder within my chest like quiet sobbing. 
I'm also bummed because my therapist (an intern who has been pretty good at describing emotional intelligence and helping me understand how to describe some things better) is going to possibly stop meeting me and she said she might refer me to a different therapist. Not the end of the world, but still sad to think of this person that I've been explaining my sadness to.
Thats pretty much it. I think I just needed to write something instead of balling up and pretending not to exist in bed mid-afternoon."	severe
dev_pid_4370	"Had a nightmare about suicide : I haven’t had a major depressive episode in three years. When I was depressed, I had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and I’ll never forget them. Lately, I’ve been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday I had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up.
In the dream, it was a sunny day and I was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. There was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and I went to go hang out with them; but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious (in real life she’s not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so I don’t know why I conjured this up). She was saying stuff like “well when I jump off a bridge this won’t matter” and everyone was laughing, but I burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffering. To make matters worse, I was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. One of the other people in the group looked at me while I was crying and asked, “what’s wrong?” and I said “because none of these people around me will be here after I end my life.”
Then I started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people’s parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could’ve done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. I said to myself “I hate thinking about suicide” and cried even harder, and then I “woke up” in the dream (but not actually in real life). Then after I woke up from that dream into another dream, I was suddenly in my best friend’s house traumatized from that dream I had. I was going to see my girlfriend soon, but I was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though I have her. Then I actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated.
I wanted to tell my friends about the dream I had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so I thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it."	severe
dev_pid_4371	"Desperately need help but can never seem to get results : I’m at a complete loss and have no idea where to look. My whole life people have perceived me as the funny, goofy extrovert. To be fair it’s a role I’ve given to myself, growing up I would always try to dismiss anything I found negative with a joke. Being the funny one allowed me to hide from reality and kept me happy. This worked fine throughout elementary school and made me a pretty happy kid, yet in middle school things started taking a turn for the worse. 
For as I can remember I’ve struggled with ADHD and anger issues. After middle school and throughout high school I started developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and borderline bipolarism. Im not sure if I can say I was bullied, but I have definitely been traumatized by certain friend groups and people. For example, in grades 8 and 9 I was in a toxic friend group with the older “cool kids”. Because I was the young one I was always seen as lesser and treated like I was everyone’s verbal punching bag. I would often be excluded from events or embarrassed in class because of the teasing. In grade 11 I once got confronted by an angry mob of big dudes because some guy that I beat up (in complete self defence) told someone that I was making fun of his autistic friend. This resulted in me getting circled and nearly lynched (not literally, at least I hope) for something I didn’t do. I still struggle with severe PTSD from that day. 
I’m not fucked up all of the time, sometimes I’ll go weeks feeling like I’m on cloud 9. But no matter what it all comes back eventually. The only thing I’ve actually had diagnosed is ADHD, simply because I have no idea how to explain my other internal struggles nor do I want to. Very rarely will I tell someone that I need help. Anytime I’ve ever tried to bring them up friends or family my problems were trivialized and met with responses like “oh things will get better with time” or “just wait till you’re an adult, you’ll figure it out”. 
Well I’m an adult now, and I sure as fuck haven’t figured it out. I struggle with the same issues I’ve had since I was a kid, and it’s made me feel so terribly isolated no matter how many friends/family I’m surrounded by. I’ve resorted to smoking weed every single day until I pass out to try and keep my problems at bay while I try to finish university. This has made me a lazy cunt that struggles to maintain what used to be my favourite hobby, bodybuilding. I’ve tried quitting a few times, however whenever I stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that’s haunted me my entire life just comes back. 
I’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.
I don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up. Because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume I’m full of shit all the time and I’ve definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. I’m only 19 years old, and I’m starting to reach my breaking point. I don’t know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing I want more than to feel consistently normal. 
If you were to see me in public, you wouldn’t guess any of this. You would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. Behind that mask is a lonely cunt that doesn’t fully understand other people and sure as fuck doesn’t understand himself. I do have lots of great friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better family, however despite my blessings I feel terribly cursed. 
Please, does anybody have some advice???"	severe
dev_pid_4372	"Why do I even bother to get help when no one listens? : My sui thoughts are getting worse so what to they do? Tell me to take a medication that I dont want to take and will probably just make everything worse.

dev_pid_4373	"Why do you choose to live? : I am super done with life. I hate living. I hate looking in front of the mirror everyday and looking at my reflection. I delusionally quit computer science when I realized even if I make 150k a year it wouldn't be enough to support my family let alone the people in my neighborhood. I don't know, I guess over time you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. Just by observing those people with same scenario my age. I look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. They are put on pills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. In my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. The thing I hate most about myself too is the fact I feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle East who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. There is the camps in China where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. People say the world is getting better but it feels blind. I know people in Canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. The truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country.  There's also so many other issues. Like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercriminalty aspect of it, but there's so many more layers to that. These artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. They get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. If middle class kids liked bubbly music I'm a 100% certain these poor artist would start making music like that. The truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you won't be able to support your familly so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. The other sad truth is 1 in some big number artist make it. Look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were criminals or lived a gangster lifestyle (in this generation). A lot of these artist don't want to do that. NBA youngboy (jail, drugs, etc), the Kelly (killed best friend), Kodak black (drugs, jail, etc).  
Why don't they just do pop? No resources, not enough time to work a 8 hour job, sing, create, etc. A lot of pop artist have big teams. If your a female in a poor area you're even more screwed. Most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. Their isn't much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. We see those who succeeded but not many of those who didn't. A lot of them did put work in too. My whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. The pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. Even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. Anyways I ask myself, why should you live if you're just at the bottom? Hope? We see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people don't end up like that. You have to pick a poison. In the world we live in it's getting harder and harder for people to make it out. Kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one willing to hand that out. Homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what I've seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. Why should I live, work 5 times harder, sacrifice all of my free time, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? Also, I mentioned I hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? Why should that be okay? Why is that something you can tell someone. Be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. I disagree with telling someone that. There should be a fine line. I think kids shouldn't get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. Why is suicide looked down upon is what I'm asking. Hell, should I tell that homeless person to have hope? Statistically speaking, things aren't getting better for him. Enjoy the little things. This is where I am just being a brat, but it's hard to enjoy those things when I don't know if I'm getting food tommorow, and then I see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. Humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you don't have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. It kinda gets to you. What is the point of living? Friends and family I never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? Also people do care they just to social media to help. Reality is that doesn't help. We had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. You can't get violent or cause disruption or else you get arrested. Therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you don't want. It seems like half the time people bring awareness to stuff it's cause it's trendy too. I saw so many post on the Australian fires, but a few on the Uighur camps in China. I saw millions mourn the death of a rapper, but minimal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it isn't trendy. Respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? It doesn't work. Some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. No one puts their hand up cause it's not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support aren't important. 8.4 mill on black lives and less than 100000 combined on Mexican and brown. Sorry random rants in random order. Lots to get off my chest. What's the point of living. I'm a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. I looked it up, and found only 1 brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. The rest were predominantly white or black. Statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. Even brown chicks guys from other races. I'd say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. The other options aren't so friendly either. Go to school and not support my family. Bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music. What's the point in living? Hell I make it seem like I'm just saying for people at the bottom, but even other people too."	severe

I hate the (admittedly lucrative) field I'll be working in, but that doesn't bother me so much. I hate being an adult and not having the social skills to make new friends or have romantic relationships. I hate the vicious cycle of social isolation and social anxiety. I hate knowing that I missed out on years of essential social development. 
There are two things that really bother me about this. 
First, it's my fault. Men have tried to be friends with me (even recently), women have shown interest in me (not so much anymore lmao), but I just ignored them and wasted my life reading nonfiction books that serve no use beyond bringing a conversation to a halt as fast as possible. Why? First because of depression. Then because I had  isolated myself enough to have social anxiety. Now because I never learned how to have healthy friendships, much less flirt with women. All avoidable. 
Second, it feels like it's over. I didn't have experiences that can only happen at certain times in your life. I've passed the point where being socially incompetent is acceptable. It's fucked and I can't unfuck it. My future coworkers are largely in serious relationships or married. I feel like a child talking to them. They have preexisting friend groups, often near work. I have neither, and I already have a reputation for being weird and antisocial. 
Of course my life isn't ""over"" for certain, but there's probably a substantial chance I end up isolated and depressed again, and the fix won't be as easy as dropping a medication. Then it wouldn't be a cognitive distortion that my life is miserable, and the only way to escape my depression is to escape my life, it would be true. 
Not expecting any advice. Just needed to vent, since there's no one I can say this to irl."	severe
dev_pid_4375	"I need advice... : So I’m just gonna tell you my story.
I’ve felt extremely depressed for the past year and a half or so, ever since my dad died to a heart condition in October of 2018. Flash forward to now, and I’m still like I am, but I feel it’s worse. For one, my family is in very bad shape in terms of finances, especially due to the fact that my mother and father had a baby before he died. So it’s becoming difficult to pay for anything we need, like food, clothes, etc.. 
On the family side of things, most of us are just divided. Fights have broken out, causing some of us to just not show up to family gatherings anymore. It doesn’t really help that I wasn’t exactly close to any of them in the first place. I just feel like I’m caught in the middle of it all. And I feel hopeless because I have absolutely no clue how to help, nor do I think I can.
On the personal side, I just have this deep, severe hatred for myself now. Not only does feeling like this leave me tired and I just have no drive to do anything anymore, even the things I normally enjoy, but it gets really bad sometimes because I sometimes think that I wanna kill myself, and that the world would be better off without me. That the pain would finally end. On top of all that, I’m CONSTANTLY bullied, online and in real life, for enjoying the things that I do, or I just get bullied in general. I also struggle to make friends, because I feel extremely insecure. Most of the kids at my school are super popular, and I’m just this socially anxious, insecure kid in the corner. People tell me to have confidence and people will like me, but it doesn’t work. When I try to be confident and tell jokes and stuff, it leads to people calling me weird, laughing insultingly, or just being silent. Even the friends I do have do this sometimes. My best friend in the whole world (he has always had my back and never once insults me or anything, he just constantly tries to help me out) moved away and I never get to see him anymore.
I’m super sorry for the long explanation, I just really wanna feel better, but I keep losing hope by the minute. I feel like there is zero chance for me to get better. The only chance I have, in my eyes, is for this to all get progressively worse.
Thank you for reading if you did."	severe
dev_pid_4376	"So I realized today that I am so broken I can't be fixed : So I've been in therapy since I was 13 years old and still I am haunted by my past. I don't know how to let go of the terrible things that people have done to me. Like was I a terrible person for sure. I told horrible lies but I lived with the consequences and now I'm left with nothing but torment for the things that have been done to be by others. I don't know how to forgive others. It's not in my nature it's not in my heart. I'm a bitter woman. My husband always tells me that I ""talk down to people."" I don't talk down to people I speak in facts and truths, no one wants to hear it, and Im always the bitch. So fine no one likes me not even my family I'm the black sheep. I've been trying for years and years to fit in but now I'm asking myself why? I don't believe what they believe I  have lived a different life from them so I don't need to be like them. I've been struggling with a severe mental illness for over half my life and things went downhill fast when I got pregnant with my son and I have never recovered. I'm a lost cause and there is no hope for me. I'm here for my kids but I just don't know that it's enough anymore. No one really cares at the end of the day. I'm just some ""stuck up bitch who thinks I'm better than everyone else."" And yes that is a direct quote from my husband! He sounds so nice right?!"	severe

I'm freaking out. I would've be probably dying in pain by now or maybe dead. But i just couldn't do it. I'm still crying after the whole thing. I'm a bit glad i didn't do it, because there's so much to live for and i want to be happy and want everyone to be happy. I'll reach out for help.

dev_pid_4378	I’m so tired : Part time job Iv been scraping at for 7 years and the whole time trying for a full time position at the company. Even getting my CDL license to get a step up but showing hard work and loyalty means nothing in this world. Living with mother in-law (who has ever self inflicted ailment known in the book, also a hoarder who we had to clean her room multiple times), fiancés (annoying, over bearing, “can’t be left alone without her bestie”, bitch) of a best friend, and two dogs that just can’t fucking lay down and relax. I want to move me and my future wife out but I can’t get the job to do it. They say money isn’t everything but I bet if I had a shit fucking ton of it I’d be happier. This paycheck to paycheck bullshit is killing me mentally. I pinch every penny I get but it eventually slips from my grasp. I drink on the weekends. Just to bring a lil light into my life. Thought of killing myself but my wife is what I hold on to. She’s my life. My whole world. I just hate that I have to share her and that it’s not just me and her yet. She understands my pain and my problems. She tells me to hold on and that we will be free of all this some day. I use to believe her completely but as of late Iv been growing further and further from the idea. I’m just so tired.	severe
dev_pid_4379	"The world is cruel, unfair, and unforgiving : I have fought this fucking disease since I was a child, apparently born with it, as m symptoms started cropping up during elementary school. I also was diagnosed PTSD, Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and paranoia disorders. I have just reached twenty and yet feel like my life is over.
I have no parents, no family, NO ONE. One of them died when I was in elementary school. My parent tried to shoot themselves in the face in front of me, neglected me, and threw fits of rage early in my childhood. The other abandoned me at birth but I was never put into the ""system"" and tossed from place to place, grew up in a rural hellhole that is rife with crime and poverty, no home. 
All I have left is one of my grandparents, as I watched the other one die, and I weep constantly at the thought of my grandmother dying too. Because I know it is inevitable. Life is cruel.
Nature is not fair. Humans as a species have overcame so many barriers as a species to evolve, yet we create these meaningless societal institutions constructs that create even more unnecessary struggle. All my life I was told my goal was to be good in school, to be smart, to land a good job, and I would make it.
I had no idea that I would be raped as a teenager. I had no idea that I would be molested by doctors and that would create a lifetime of PTSD. I had no idea my first two partners would abuse me. I have tried my damndest to stay in school whilst these terrible things happen, but there is no forgiveness for weakness in this world. 
I remember not finishing some student council powerpoint in my last month of high school. I didn't go to school my last month, as I was borderline suicidal. I remember a teacher getting up in my face and telling me how I didn't deserve to be a leader, how disappointed people should be in me. She had marked me down for months despite me scoring a perfect on the AP exam, because she preferred my sister in a foster home above me, and knew I was terrified of her.
 Another teacher was great friends with the guy who molested me and gave me straight 0s for missing school because my PTSD had become unbearable. The principal told me I should give up my ""dream universities"" and settle for a local tech school that didnt have my program. It was not fair. They didn't realize what I went through at home, or my lack of one.
It's been 3 years, and the people I graduated with are in junior year of university, I am so behind. I managed to go to a somewhat good private school later on with scholarship, but I hate it here. I was borderline molested by another doctor who pushed me around and touched me innapropriately, my PTSD is so bad to the point where I can't breathe if I hear anything medical related.
 My school's organization is a mess and many people fail. I keep having to withdraw from classes cause my disability accomodations were denied. People are rude and catty. I sit in my room and have severe paranoia and panic attacks till I sob and shake with pure agony. My psychiatrist doesn't believe how bad I am. It is unfair.
After being in 2 abusive relationships I met a guy online and things were going fine for a bit. We visited each other in different countries. Then when my PTSD got bad he started calling me a special snowflake, saying I was horrible, a drama queen, mentally unwell and ill, must have been exaggerating my abuse, etc. Ruined my self esteem. I am visiting and in bed with him right now and he is so sweet and kind, yet I remember his cruel words. I truly do not feel loved by anyone in this world.
I wanted to be a scientist to research cures for depression, but my school could care less for me. No one cares about me. I have no friends, no support, and my physical and mental health is shit. If there's one thing I've learned in doing scientific research, it is how cruel and vile nature is. I can't handle all the pain in this world."	severe
dev_pid_4380	"There’s nothing good about my life : I’m 18 and I’ve been stuck in my room for 7 months. I don’t go off with friends near as much as I used to, mainly because I can’t 
About a year and a half ago I started selling drugs. I was really good at it, and I had a constant party life style. I had money to blow, drugs to run through, and there was always something to do. I got up to about 15k at once point 
We would rail coke, get drunk, smoke weed and all kinds of shit the party would never stop even when going to sell the drugs. I would have cars lined up outside of my house, really fucking stupidly, coming one after another. 
I got so used to this standard of living. Everyone wanted to be around me, I had people I didn’t even remember meeting saying what’s up like they knew me. I wasn’t famous or anything, but it was like I was around town. During this time I managed to get kicked out of high school my senior year 
All of my “friends”, I started to almost never hear from. It’s like I became a loser in a matter of weeks 
I don’t even know how I managed this, but I quit selling and blew through all of my money in months with not a damn thing to show for it. Almost all of my “friends”, I started doing kratom when I was near brome, a legal opiate basically. It made me okay with laying in bed doing nothing all day, and I felt way less bad about my life 
I realized I was just another guy, I’m not special at all. My goal with selling was to get enough money to start up something legit like a business, I refused to work a 9-5 and slave away all day. 
Well long story short now I’m broke. I stay in my room most of the time. I ended up getting my GED, but I haven’t done anything with it. No one really wants to hang around me anymore and I’m not invited to anything. I feel more alone than ever before 
I want to actually become something, I have plans. Plans that I haven’t acted on, everytime I bring myself to do something I just end up falling out on it. I have almost no motivation, but I’m also scared of being a failure. I don’t wanna be another guy working paycheck to paycheck struggling to get by. I know I can’t succeed if I don’t try, but it’s just scary having no idea what the future holds. These negative thoughts have kept me from even trying, like I’m useless and won’t be able to do anything if I tried. 
I’ve thought about killing myself a few times, but I don’t think I’ll ever act on it, I’m too afraid to die. There’s a lot more that goes into my depression, but that’s the gist of it I guess. I thought about deleting this just now, but whatever I think I sort of explained my situation"	severe
dev_pid_4381	"Can I just get a little feedback : I used to be suicidal, actually it was all I ever thought about at one point in my life, but that was years ago and I thought things had gotten better truly and actually in early January I was feeling the best I’ve ever felt it was like my life was finally moving on the up and out I had my own car I had a job I loved and I had passed all my classes with another semester on the horizon and now after a string of bad luck, my car that broke down and now a job that only seems to get more and more stressful by the day I feel like I’m sinking back into that pit I was in almost four years ago now. 
I’m so angry and bitter and I can do nothing but cry most days I just don’t know what to do. I mean therapy is the best option but I don’t have money and I’m pretty sure my insurance can’t cover it or at least enough of it to help me out. I just wish I just wasn’t so upset all the time I just wish I didn’t lash out at every minor inconvenience it feels like the person I was just two months ago was just so far to who I am now and I’m slowly but surely bringing myself right back to square one. 
I dunno maybe some tips to help myself out I mean I’m not at a point of suicide don’t worry it hasn’t gotten back to that point it’s just beginning to mess with the relationships in life and just seems to suck the soul out of everything I do"	severe
dev_pid_4382	"I manipulate everyone naturally. : I've had quite a few revelations to myself lately of how I'm constantly manipulating almost everyone I know and I can't stop. I always thought I just had ADHD and couldn't pay attention but I've noticed that the things I remember are only THINGS I'm interested in. I can't remember birthdays, promises, or even conversations from the day before clearly, but I can remember a 15 digit random key passcode with relative ease. I've told myself countless times I'll try to always acknowledge my partner's feelings and to think clearly about what I'm doing means for them, but every day it seems I convince myself again that only trying to do what I think they want isn't emotional manipulation. 
The reason this is in r/depression is that I'm seeing this happen over and over and I'm watching myself destroy my partner and somehow I still find myself to be the victim of my own abuse instead of them. I want to stop but I don't know if can I escape my own manipulation.. I can't stop thinking want to just die to save them from myself because I don't believe I can change."	severe
dev_pid_4383	"I hate what I’ve become. : I hate what I’ve become.
This is going to be a long one, so buckle up. Usual story, normal childhood up until 8th grade when my mom became an alcoholic. Rough experience in high school, dad has to work to support us we have to fend for ourselves. First suicide attempt was 16. Things got a bit better, until around 19. Second suicide attempt after losing a job, a gf of two years and dropping out of school. Go to the psych, clinical depression. Have trouble keeping a job and getting back to school until 22. Meet an amazing girl, maintain a job for 9 months, make plans to go back to school, gain some muscle. All is well until this past summer. Job is causing so much anxiety, just don’t show up. Gf breaks up with me (totally justified) bc I cant bring myself to do anything. It’s been 6 months. Still not over her. Lost 25 pounds of muscle in 3 months. Don’t have a job. Struggling through these semesters. All of my “friends” are graduated college, never invite me out. Don’t blame them, I’m not sad on the outside but the one’s gf never liked me and that circle always talks behind everyone’s back. Only thing I enjoy now is playing guitar and writing music, the only positive thing in my life. So, I’m 23, my friends don’t like me, my ex is done with me, I’m not going to get a bachelors for at least another two years, I’m sickly, pale, scrawny, socially inept, jobless, living at home, and depressed. I think the beginning of change has to be today or I won’t make it. I decided to delete all social media apps (group chat so no talking to friends, same with snap, instagram, Twitter, and after this Reddit.) I’ve always been hopelessly optimistic but I think life has finally burnt me out. Not sure if there is a point here. I will try. But I’m just so far behind, I already met and failed with the love of my life, drive away all my friends, am a burden to my family and society, and have no skills or talents or worth. Don’t try to cheer me up please. Just listen, understand, acknowledge, and be on your way. I do my best on my own, I always thought. But the older you get, the less that rings true. If you read, thanks for reading. I don’t know why anonymous internet users make us feel validated but I need that today. Hug your loved ones, have a beer, watch a movie, just be better than me. Thank you."	severe
dev_pid_4384	"I need to vent a little bit : Well, I was diagnosed with depression in December 2018, I was prescribed Lexapro, except I can't afford it, so I get Connect instead (which is a generic copy of Lexapro), for a year I've been really shitty, almost like I was able to deal with everything before because, well, *I wasn't depressed, I didn't have it so bad*, or at least that's what I told myself, until the diagnosis which really threw me to the floor...
There have been a couple of hotspots of hope here and there, some days I don not want to kill myself, some days I do, but I mostly just want to *cease* to exist, to be free you know?
One such hotspot of hope, and the reason I really want to vent today, was a girl I had been connecting with at uni, for about 6 months now, we've become very close friends, but as one is wont to do I developed feelings for that girl, she seemed to reciprocate my advances, letting me hug her and she hugging back, she sitting next to me in class, playing with my hair and sometimes bringing me food.
She invited me today to an event to an amusement park, where we paid around $20 for 6 hours of unlimited passes to any game we wanted to go, I was really looking forward to it, but lo and behold when I got there she was with her boyfriend whom I've never even heard of before.
Of course, I was crushed, I *am* crushed, I feel... empty, odd... I dunno... almost betrayed? But deep down I know I wasn't betrayed, we never dated or got serious (she said ""te quiero"" a lot to me, if you know Spanish you know it's a very wholesome ""I love you"" but it does not necessarily imply romantic love)
I don't know how I feel, just... down... I called it quits after three hours there, I just couldn't handle seeing them together, the jealousy just got the better of me.
And I feel very guilty for posting this here, I don't even know if this is a proper place to post this, but I just want to hear some advice, some help, right now I just want to get *DRUNK*, I am trying to talk to some buddies to get a drink, I want to be *numb*, I want to be *stupid* and enjoy bliss in ignorance, or at least to feign ignorance. I feel like shit, and I know this is gonna trigger a very bad episode of just plain old depression, the kind where you just want to stay in bed and do nothing, because nothing seems to be worth doing, I've been getting those a lot, the last thing I needed was this, but such is life huh? Sometimes it just guts you right there and then and you are just left *there*. *Alone.*
I don't want to be alone, I don't want to feel so worthless, I don't want to be the piece of shit that I feel I am. I want to be better, but I don't know *how!* I just don't know! And I've been trying, and trying and trying hard and nothing seems to work, and everything I do seems to be going to shit, I don't even know how the fuck did I get where I am at uni, I am four courses away from passing all the necessary courses for graduation and yet, I feel I do not belong where I am, I feel like I am a living lie, I feel so incredibly stupid whenever I take a test, I don't know how I keep getting passing grades. I know no one is willing to hire me, as I've been trying for about a year now to get a job, even trying to talk to my contacts to see if they can put in a word for me, but I never get an interview. You know, I feel like I am going nowhere, I feel like a terrible weight to my mother, and I feel a lot like my father, who is also an unemployed POS, I really dislike my father, and yet I feel like everyday I am becoming more like him, just an angry, envious, jealous (he always shouted at my mother accusing her of cheating), I feel like I can't control myself. I look at the mirror, and I don't see myself, I see him, and I just don't want to be him, I'd rather pick up trash in the street to at least hold a job, and somehow I feel that's insulting to the people whose job it is to pick up trash.
I take care of three little quails, their names are Leonarda, Yang and Marianelo, two females and a male respectively, and when I pick them up and I feel their warmth, it's almost the only thing that makes me not want to quit just yet, but in the end they are just silly birds, and I say silly in the most loving way possible, but they just like to run free and very rarely come to me.
I don't guys, I am losing it, some days are bad... some days are... some days are like today. I am losing control, I just want to let it off my chest, I just want to be heard and I can't find anywhere else to throw my voice, this is just a hail mary, I don't know what I am doing, I just want to feel better, I just want it all to end.
I am sorry for the long post, I am sorry for the broken english, I am sorry for everything, I don't know anymore, I am just sorry."	severe
dev_pid_4385	haven't felt anything other than depression since end of toxic relationship : About a year ago I got out of a 5ish month relationship with a girl who I fell in love with. I thought everything I went through was just normal relationship shit, turns out she has BPD which is actually insanely hard to deal with. The best part of my life became the worst part of my life with the worst depression I have ever had when she just stopped talking to me all together out of the blue, and at the time we were in the same class every morning, so needless to say it was annihilating me from the inside out for about a month, until she all the sudden wanted me back. This happened 2 times until I just said fuck it the last time and blocked her on everything, graduated high school and havent talked to her since. Shortly after the last time she did it I learned about BPD and all the tells were there and it made so much sense. The entire thing was just emotional abuse and manipulation from the start that caused me to begin self harm. I've noticed that since then I have some big fucking committment issues and I just push people away without trying, which just makes the depression and loneliness worse and I don't know what to do anymore...	severe
dev_pid_4386	"Not sad or happy about my life but just nothing : I am 25, bilingual, gay(not ugly and above average looking and fit), Asian, nerdy(lived through most of my life being making fun or hated for my eccentricity)
I have no friends, but many acquaintances.(maybe I am putting friends to a very high standard)
I never had any relationship even though I came out 7 years ago to my parents, and being very open about my sexuality.
(I don’t want to share my body to strangers, so I reject all hook up attempts, and I feel that most gay people I met are just insecure, aimless and superficial) 
I am not shy, and I am eloquent and talkative in front of people. I can easily manage social scenes, but I don’t actually care how others think about me.
I was diagnosed with depression since high school for 4 years. I quit the medication few years ago because they are influencing my intelligence(seriously, I am going to work in software development, and I would rather feel shit but have a functioning brain than living in an illusion of relief and happiness caused by drug)
I born from a very conservative family in one of the East Asian countries. I hate my country and escape to US to study and hope to settle here. I have been here 7 years. Now I am getting a master degree in US, and I will be interning at one of the prestigious software company in this summer. (Now, I realize that my hatred to my mother nation is pointless, my suffering is purely due to my unfitness to this world, and nothing to do with policy and culture)
I struggled through the hardest part of my depression by following these tips below.
1.keep a routine and stick to it, no matter how tire how shit you feel. a to-do list such as “I will wash clothes today at xxxx” will help
2.abandon social network, they are toxic to your mental state. I only use it to share information rather than show-off my fake good life or see anyone’s fake good life.
3. Leave toxic people, and YES, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. And give up on people, give up on hoping someone will magically show up and fix all your problems. 
4. A healthy life style is very important to keep you energy level up. Eat good, sleep good, be active.
5. Search on some higher purpose of life. I give up finding any happiness from human connection. I never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, disappoint by people again again and again. Then I stick my interests to machine, I study computer science and I am fascinated by technology. I develop a religious zealous of what a future world I want to create or envisioned: i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. A world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. A world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding.  That’s why my major focus of my computer science degree is artificial intelligence, go figure. The current state of humanity is pathetic, and that is why there are so many depression on this earth.
7.  Then, accept that it’s ok to never feel happy again. But the key to manage a life is not being always happy. I feel that I am more and more in the middle ground: not happy not sad, but just nothing. In these years since I was diagnosed with depression, I find out a single truth. 
Depression can never be gone and it can only be managed.
I gradually accept the fact that I am just a machine,(human body is in fact, just a machine)and I won’t feel the same happiness when I experience the same events like normal people do.  I will feel nothing, but sometime I feel that these kinds of nothingness is a form of tranquility. As long as I am not in constant pain and agony, I am fine with my current state. When people hurt me, I don’t care. When people benefits me, I don’t care. People are too predictable for me, and they are not important anymore. (The only exception is my parents because I feel sorry for them to suffer me)
However, after I live with these mindset for years, I gradually observe that not all people are asshole in nature. Not all people are ignorant. I will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation. (Someone who are supposed to hurt me, do not act upon, or someone who are supposed to benefits me, do not act upon)
Maybe as a person with depression, I can never experiences the joy of “living” with in this world.
But it doesn’t stop you to “live” out of this world, just treat it as a long boring trip on a train with randomly popping in objects of interests. It is not hard at all to get used to this."	severe
