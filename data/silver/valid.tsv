i just do not know what happened i do not have an idea how to preface this i do not even know why i am writing it but i do not know what to do. i have tried seeking help, i am taking pills but it has not helped, i am in therapy but it has not helped, i have talked to friends and it has it helped. about half an hour ago a thought crossed my mind, i have an idea where my pills are, they are easy to overdose on if you are not careful. out of habit i thought no that is stupid or something. but i stood up. i started walking but i was screaming internally to go back, to sit down, but i kept walking towards the medicine cabinet. if my mom had not hidden and it was not dark. i do not know what to do.	moderate

how should i kill myself question i have got three or four options one the weak ass pellet gun i have done stairs i doubt it will do it but what is your opinion? two unfortunately also weak ass ibuprofen and tylenol acetaminophen which probably means kidney or liver failure which might be painful three the knife the most painful option down the stream of course i am trying to accomplish something suffocating myself to sleep the most peaceful option in the end although i suppose the knife would be peaceful in the end as well but i would be in a very large amount of stress but i would end up having dmt shot into my brain and voila i am drifting any other option that could be in a random house hold that you guys know of preferable the most least painful note if you give a self help line i am doing the secret option number i do a nose dive off of my balcony not killing me but just breaking most of my bones	moderate

i know i am a good person but i have come to the realization that it never really matters. removed 	not depression
i hate myself i have struggled with my self image all my life. i have always looked at myself in the mirror thinking i was fat, ugly and unworthy. i spent my younger years letting people take advantage of me just to feel good about myself. this was at a time when i look back now that i realised i was beautiful and thin. now years later i have gained weight and can not stand to look at myself in the mirror. i have been in a relationship with the same person for years. he tells me he loves me and that i am beautiful but no matter the words he tells me i just do not believe him. i can not even motivate myself to fix the things i hate. interacting with family, old friends, or even just trying to get the will to leave the house to seek help gives me crippling anxiety. this has become worse since i lost my job about a month and a half ago. i hide this from everyone around me fearing that they will tell me it is not true when i know it is. or worse, making me seek help when i know it would not do anything. some nights i lay there crying only feeling the intense pains in my chest. if i do sleep i have vivid dreams of loved ones telling me they are thisgusted by me and hate me. i am tired of living my life like this, i do not want to feel this way anymore but i can not motivate myself to seek help.	moderate
just so lost i can not even begin to explain this shit. i just feel like no matter how hard i try to be happy, i am just living in a grey mood of fake happy from smoking fucking weed all the time. my lady told me she wants to die. she does not want to kill herself because she does not want to leave me and the kids without her, but she says she had no reason to live. i can not afford to pay for her to talk to someone professionally. she does not want to talk about anything specific about the depression, just says she is sad. does not know why. and i fucking get it. i feel the same. just cruising by, same day after same day. no happy. no sad. just tired. emotionally grey. i do not know what to say to her when she says she is sad. it feels like i annoy her if i try to comfort her with hugs or saying i am here to talk. i do not know what to do, so i do not do anything. it is like, i want to help, but my fucking mind would not even try to help. just a droning uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh in my fucking head. i am sure the weed does not help, but if i quit smoking weed i turn into a giant fucking asshole because every emotion comes out as anger. so what the fuck man? how the fuck do i even begin to deal with this? somebody fucking help man.	moderate

 thing to live for... yeah... i only have one thing to live for and it is this girl i like. after about a month of realizing that i actually loved this girl she attempted suicide. fortunately it was an attempt and she did not succeed. when she i learnt that she tried to kill herself my mental state went rock bottom. i thought of every single way possible to kill myself and wondered who it would affect and that i did not give a shit about it anyways. this has all happened in the time lapse of a week and i needed to write it down somewhere. last thing to note and that is fuck life. 	moderate

i have been trying my whole life to not be what my parents are and get out of the cycle and system i have been put through and i am back again with my own family. i hated growing up going to the court house all the time. i would attribute all the constant fighting and back and forth to a majority of what i deal with today not being able to find joy in anything and constantly lying about happiness and pushing everyone away. i swore on my life to this day i would never put any children i have through this and yet i am struggling to find my own time with him that does not involve struggling and arguing with my bm everyday. i just wanted a family and i am slowing losing my sanity and everyone around me. i do not expect advice or anyone to really have much to say i have always tried to find a way out of this or see the good in it. it is just getting so much lately. this weight on my chest is so heavy lately i feel like crying everyday and if i am not crying i am held up in my room. i am and everyone tells me that it is only beginning and everything can get better but i do not know if i can anymore.	moderate
depression made me the monster i was always afraid of becoming and i did not even know it until it was too late. just in january i finally moved out of a toxic and abusive home. i finally started a job that i was proud of and happy with. i still had one of the most amazing, loving pets in my life. in february, the company let go of my whole department. in march, i finally had to put my childhood pest friend tiger to rest. this week, i started a new job and i have stopped crying mornings and nights because the pay is awful and the workload is immense and no other jobs i have applied to have reached back out. now, i am going to lose my apartment because i can not afford it. today, my manager at my second job said she is considering closing up for a few weeks and i literally rely on that paycheck to pay for my car. less than days, my life has turned upside down. i got so depressed and got so drunk from gin at a d amp d session that i threatened to harm or kill my self in front of my party and i do not even remember. and you know what is scary? i wished i would have done something about it later when i was not in my right mind to think about it. today sitting in the shower i realized that i have become the one thing i was always afraid of toxic. my mental health has deteriorated past the point of salvaging. i had not noticed how nasty, rude, thissociative, and standoffish i have been to people until i realized that one text from my mother nearly sent me off the deep end of packing my bags tonight and leaving to go camp alone or just go to the beach and drown. what the fuck? who fucking does that? i randomly deactivate my social media accounts just to see who would notice. i try listening to my therapist but things she says makes me so mad or make me realize things that are so out of control in my life that i just give up and sink down into nothing instead of trying to fix it but also what is the point? i have come home every day to lie in bed and watch videos until i sleep. i nearly broke down crying in the grocery store today from how overwhelmed i was and the intrusive thoughts in my head are growing worse and worse and worse. i am a failure. the world is literally ending. none of the mental health methods i have tried have been successful at helping me. i just get worse every year. i do not contribute to society in any healthy way. even my physical body is shit and iv been in and out of doctors office and hospitals for the amount of pain i am in regularly with no answers. i just want it to stop.	moderate

my little brother may have cancer and i think meds are causing me to feel strongly about suicide hi all, i found out today that my little brother may have lymphoma and he is being tested for it. i am an absolute mess right now. i just started valdoxan last night and have not wanted to die more than now. not sure if it is a meds thing but holy shit. the world is absolutely fucking bleak. i would give my life and more just so my brother could live. he does not deserve this and i can not fucking handle it. i do not want to see him in pain or hurt. he has so much potential and he is so kind and just such a gentle presence in the world. i just can not handle this but i would so gladly give him my place in life. i am also sick with the flu and missing work and feeling like i am out of my body all together and i started valdoxan last night. my mind is just somewhere else all together but i have never felt shittier. i have always thought about suicide but now the world just feels colourless and like i am the outlier. i do not even think i am living. is this normal? do you think it could be because of the meds? can they kick in this quick? i want to see my gp but he is booked for weeks. i am sorry i just needed to let this out. thank you for reading.	severe

work told me to stay home for weeks, but due to limited infrastructure also says only essential employees are to access work server. fiscal year end is coming up, and i have no other work to do. as title says, i can not access work server but all my work is tied to fiscal year end which all programs are on work server . i am anxious because i feel like i have nothing to work on, for the weeks. boss sent an email out friday advising us of the above, but stressed that this is not a vacation. well for me, it is a forced vacation because i can not do my job. i am admin, but can not do anything else adminy like scanning because i would need to physically be in the office and have access to server. right now, all my admin tasks have been focused on fiscal year end paying bills, making sure our orders come in on time, etc . i just do not know what i am supposed to do for the next weeks and feel stressed because i can not do anything i normally would, working from home, so i am going to look like i am slacking off when everyone else in the office was able to find stuff to work on. guess i am just ranting, more than looking for advice. but any little bit of advice is helpful.	not depression

starvation, humiliation and abuse... can anyone relate to being neglected as a child? for me, this one of the core bricks of my depression, and the ghosts that follow me every day... me and my sister were raised in a chaotic household, without the money needed to take care of two children. my dad in particular could become extremely angry over anything. he was and still is an alcoholic, and spend tremendous amounts of money on cigarettes and booze instead of feeding us. i often found myself hiding behind curtains and other places, eating one dollar baguettes or anything i could find. he and his parents my grandparents where quick to defend him at any cost. constant warfare between the two sides of my family made me chose sides, and who to align myself with in the next shitstorm of family drama. i was and still am extremely loyal, and will do anything someone tells me just to avoid trouble. as i said my mom and my dad did not get along and often fought over who should have have us the most, and this often resulted in things becoming very heated, my dad would often chase me on the way home to my mom, just because he was bitter over the fact that i went to my mom more than him. i know he did track where i walked because we often conveniently meet me in ally ways, and different places of the town where he never drove or would have any reason to drive to, hi used this convenience to drive me back to his place without my say . one time he and my grandparents almost rammed my sister and my mom off the road, in an argument over a party she had been to or something, when they lost them they went back home where i was gaming minecraft and started to whale on me instead, saying that i was on their side and we where thisgusting people and so forth..... honestly i do not remember much as it was this episode that left me with possible ptsd, as one doctor has said to me, but its not confirmed so.... i often prayed to god to kill me at the age of eight, as i was mentally exhausted. the police became involved several times, but nothing came of it as my dad is a master manipulator and always manages to get out of those situations, like this one time where he flirted with one of the inspectors of child protective services. bulling is also something that has stuck with me, the humiliation of public bulling in school is the one of the worst things i have ever experienced. i can take a beating, and having been kicked by my class mates to unconsciousness, i can say that humiliation is worse. standing in front of the class and having people laugh at you, leaves a sense of shame that you can not get rid off. i moved from home about half year ago and started my higher education, but all of my experiences has left me a anxious wreck, if for example someone touches me without me knowing, something like a pat on the back or a loud noise. will trigger many kinds of reactions a out fear, and if i become stressed out i often get a panic attack. this just starches the surface of what i have experienced, with abusive relationships and more, hopefully you guys can relate, i have not really had many friends at all so have not been able to compare my childhood wit anyone else, wonder if i am over reacting or not. i just needed to write some off this out, since i have been holding it in for so long and that strategy has not helped me so far. sorry for bad grammar, english not my native language.	moderate

tips on how to get help i have not been back here for a while because i thought i was doing better, but turns out now i am only worse than before. by a lot. these days everything feels so dead and pointless. all i want to do is kill myself but i can not even do that. i am clearly drowning and at this point who knows if i will even make it out of high school. and i can not bear myself actually getting diagnosed with depression because it will only remind me of how much i have lost from the successful girl i was before. yet i am so stubborn to help myself, and i just find it so hard to drag myself through everyday because it all amounts to nothing. all in all, i want a way out of this, but i am too scared to tell my parents. what should i do?	moderate

my friends found him my friends found the body of a young man who had taken his own life yesterday. he was mere meters from where i was, and in an area i pass through regularly. for the past few weeks, months, and year i have been struggling immensely with suicidal thoughts, ready to end it at any second. but i have watched my friends and coworkers react to this death with such sadness, dignity, and respect. it has completely changed my perspective. be strong, keep battling.	not depression
every day for the last months i have thought of killing myself. i keep waking up with an immediate dread having to be here. nothing brings me joy anymore and the things that seem promising quickly turn into bitter thisappointment. i dont want to go through the motions anymore. my life isnt objectively bad, but subjectivelyi ammiserable and severely depressed. ive never really planned on life past and i dont want to grow old. i dont fit it anywhere and i am constantly ignored by the few that catch my interest. my life is gray and i can not imagine a future where i am truly happy, everything is so fake.	severe
i am so lonely and nobody is favorite last night new year is eve was somehow one of the best and worst night is of my life. new year is eve going into and have both been spent alone. for the second year in a row, my friends did not invite me to hang out. with around hours to go until midnight, i checked social media and to absolutely no surprise see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. i do not know what hurt me more. seeing them together without me, or the fact that i was not even relatively surprised. they pull this shit all the time. so, i said fuck them to myself, got in a thiscord call with my internet friends who presumably were also lonely and had a blast playing video games until am. that made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my friends together without me. it is not just holiday parties they do not invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses.i amnot even exaggerating when i say they have never invited me anywhere. and these are the people i have been best friends with since fucking th grade. we sit together everyday at lunch. i do not think they do not invite me because they do not like or want me to be there, i think its because for some reason they think i wouldn t want to go, which is so far from the truth. i do not really understand. i have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. i am probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they are not with them. which leads me to my second point. i am literally nobody is favorite. nobody thinks oh!i amso exited to see meorahh today! or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice.i amjust kinda of... here. if the did think of me, maybe i would be invited to things. and i know people will say, just make new friends! but that is not how it works. i can not just make new friends because its not that easy. trust me, if it was i would have made new friends a long time ago. anyways... thanks for reading	moderate

so i feel like i have hit rock bottom i think i just want to get this off my chest. so over the weekend i had a bad episode. i had had a drink and when i past a knife in the kitchen i hurt myself before i even knew i had done it. my partner managed to patch me up and i ended up going out for a walk only to end up in a pub. one thing led to another and i managed to offend someone who decided to attack me while i was walking home. i feel ashamed and thisappointed in my self. i not only hurt myself but i put myself in a dangerous situation which i never normal would have done. hoping this will be the catalyst to getting the help i really need rather than thinking i can do it on my own because that clearly is not working.	not depression

how can you just trust someone? i really wonder how that works. i trust them but as soon as they leave, i am like shit why did i say that . these past few days i just saw again how wrong people are and yet again can not trust anyone. all they do is, while telling you something, trying to push you to tell something back so they know something about your family. and i just do not understand anymore, all i can see is people laughing with someone and turning around to roll their eyes. so why should not they do that to you too? its the same thing with texting, i can not do it. it feels so fake, every emoji they use and the things they say. so please tell me, how do you do it? how can you trust someone? or do i just have the luck and do not know genuine people? i do not know if this is really the right place to post this but i know that i am tired about living like this.	moderate

struggling hard right now ive been really struggling to be positive at all lately and it hits me hard whenever i have a bit of quiet time to myself. over the past few months a lot has changed for me, some good, a lot bad. work is not going so great which is hard for me as it used to be such an important part of my life, now i just feel isolated and filled with dread whenever i am there, like an uneasy feeling i can not really explain or shake. i have a feeling like my life is going nowhere and i am not progressing as a human being, like i am not the man i sould be, the fact i am still fairly young doesnt come to mind, i feel like i am running out of time and i havnt got much to show for myself a few months back i met girl, through a friend during a weekend of mountain biking one of the few things i can do right now that helps me forget for a few hours at least we sort of hit it off and became good friends rather quickly, something rare for me being autistic and having a lot of social problems. obviously i started to catch feelings for her, and after seeking a shite load of advice from close friends and a few failed attempts i finally scrapped together thr courage to tell her how i felt, i got a very thoughful knock back something i was expecting deep down and we both said that remaining friends will be completely okay, part of the reason i struggled to share my feelings was the fear of losing a good friend. however i know feel like i am slowly being pushed away. i am really struggling to cope with this lately as i feel like i have yet again ruined something that was going well in my life and i have been really beating myself up about the whole thing, getting the almost relentless feeling of being completely alone that i am right for nobody. i also have a very self destructive tendency to convince myself that nobody really cares about me, despite having some very close friends, some that i have actually grown closer to over recent months. friends that can make me feel that they love and care about me when i am with them can turn into people that wouldnt really care about me if i was to thissapear when left alone with my mind. the only thing i have found that helps with these feelings is tasking myself to do things to keep my mind ocupied, tasks that i have to think about fully when doing them that i can not think about anything else. i have chopped a hell of a lot of firewood in the past few days. but i can not do that sort of thing , which is when all those feeling flood back in. relentlessly. without fail. i dont really know what to do anymore and honestly i am pretty damn scared	moderate

i feel like there is truly no way out i have been depressed and lonely for years, and i just can not seem to climb upwards. i gained friend a year ago, but for about months now he is really not been giving a shit about me. my life is really stressful and i have really bad sleeping problems. i am unmotivated, i do not feel good even if i accomplish something i just feel the very same empty feeling. other is just make fun of me. i have been just spending all my time playing video games, but even games got boring alone. and when playing with others, i still feel very lonely. i am not sure of anything at this point. i used to just write poems and help others. i do not write poems anymore, but i still help others even though i am not so good of a person anymore. i always blame myself for everything since there is no one else to be blamed. afterall, i am alone. i do not know. i just do not feel like i can ever feel genuinely happy. i have really only been getting worse. i miss the person who i once was, and even though i know i should work on my current self, i just do not know. i do not have a goal that can be done. i just feel like nothing.	moderate
just need to vent so i have been depressed for a while now, i do not like using that term but i have been on prozac for about a month, and before that i was in a psychiatric hospital for a week. i absolutely hate this feeling, what is resulted it because of me and the destruction i have caused. i am so lost in life i do not have any close friends anymore, the people who i once saw as my dear close friends basically abandoned me in my time of need so now i am stuck with myself. it is so hard not being able to talk with someone because my therapist sucks and she is not helpful at all. it is just so hard, i can not stand it but i am trying for my family, i can not imagine how heart broken they would be if i left this world for my selfish needs. i have so much trouble communicating because i truly feel no one understands me, i have an eager need to adventure and hang out but there is no one for me. i am so miserable everything hurts i can not keep up with school anymore, i have fallen from a bright a student to a failure of a kid. it is only my sophomore year yet i am falling into a deep hole. it is tough trying to verbalize emotions and thoughts for me, i am getting so sick and tired of it all. my dream is to go to the beach one day, alone and relax with nothing to hold me back. i would like to die on that beach too, this world is harsh and i do not know how long i will survive, but i will keep trying for my family and for you people on this subreddit. you may not think much of it but thank you so much for even reading a sentence of this.	moderate

does anyone else get so bummed that there is no hogwarts or magic and the only thing to look forward to is a i was a bit of a loner as a kid, so i read a lot. i loved all kinds of books. i loved harry potter for obvious reasons but i always wanted to be magic and be taken away to hogwarts far away from my life. i remember reading the adventures of the wishing chair and longing to accidentally stumble upon one of these magic chairs at a garage sale and i would be taken away on adventures. i hoped one day i would realise i have special powers and fuck off to join the x men or something. basically, i am just really thisappointed in the reality of life. what is there to look forward to? i just read a post by someone else saying they gained weight because they did not care cus they would die soon and me fucking too. i am so fat now and none of my clothes look good. yesterday, i was in an uber and the guy is telling me all about how he moved here from kenya where he was a construction worker and tried all these degrees and did not like them but finally finished his finance degree so he could help his family and bruh, i can not even imagine caring about anything so much that you have that much motivation y know? i am this year and i have tried so many different degrees and schools and nothing feels right. or more accurately, i just shut down and decide it is easier to not do it. idk?? which is another reason i am struggling with making plans for the future. my brain is all just kill yourself it is easier . i was chatting to him about all the stuff i have tried to study on my way to get a tattoo and i was all it is just the concept of doing something for the rest of my life is so daunting and now i am sitting here like, bitch you am not have any problems getting tattoos left right and centre and they are for life so just pick a career too. this is more of a rant myself cus fuck my stupid self thanks if you read it	not depression

 year old college senior, no friends or job, depressed so i am a year old in my senior year of college and i have no friends due to social anxiety. i am pretty sure my social anxiety has been caused by genetics and constant moving during my teen years. to make matters worse i have never had a job before. i honestly never felt the need and also avoided it due to my anxiety and just focused on my college work, because my parents are helping me out with the tuition. i am going to graduate in a couple of months and do not know what to do. i also have no volunteer experience or internships. i wanted to go to medical school but with no extra activities it will be impossible. i am going to be taking at least gap years and want to use this time to really work on changing my life. what would you guys suggest for my first job and what would i say in an interview if they ask me what i have been doing all this time other than college? also should i volunteer so i could add something to my resume?	not depression

morning negotiation i know i am not alone, i was just wondering how common my experience is. i set an alarm and then ignore it snooze it reset it until i am going to be late for work. part of this is wrapped up in not caring about my job and marginal work ethic, i think. but as long as i can remember this has been an issue. i will tell myself i will get ready faster or i would not shower or i will shower after work and on and on, but i know the excuses are not real. i am delaying. i will be late for work. usually i am able to make myself get out of bed right about when i am supposed to be at work and then everything is a mad rush. i got into a car accident because of this once. the worst version of this felt like some kind of self preservation, i was at an awful job and one of the big red flags was when i had a panic attack and could not force myself to get out of bed to go to work. this is certainly responsible for absenteeism and me being late a lot. i think feeling like the job does not matter is part of it. probably feeling like i do not matter is part of it, too. i am in seattle so this week it is probably some low key self preservation as well, but that is unrelated to this having been a challenge my whole life. more alarms, louder alarms, etc, do not help. getting everything ready the night before is smart, but also allows me to press my luck even more. i do not imagine there are a number of tips and tricks for dealing with this, mostly i was just looking to see how common this is.	moderate

had a shitty, anxiety filled day and boyfriend ended it even worse all day, i had an overwhelming feeling like i was about to die. not from illness or pain, i just have really bad irrational fears from time to time, and this time i thought i would just stop breathing at some point. it gets especially bad if i forget to take my antidepressants regularly i hate the pills so much , which of course i did not this past week. that one is on me. but a few hours ago, my boyfriend tried to call me and talk me down from freaking out. we talked about nothing in particular for a bit til it came to a conversation about what he did yesterday night. he is been hanging out with two female coworkers a lot recently. they go out to eat and shop which he usually hates , which is a little weird to me, but i was fine. but a few hours ago, he was telling me some things that did not add up. he said he found out he was allergic to alcohol, but he is underage. i asked him about it and he said he tried a couple shots. where did you get alcohol from? he said he stopped by to say hi to his manager on his way home and she offered him alcohol. wait, but weren t you driving your two female coworkers home that night too? yes, they were there and they drank and got wasted haha. but you drank, and you were the driver. and you told me you got home at . did you drive drunk? a pause. i may have lied. he told me that he actually went to his manager is house party. with his co workers that he spends a lot of time with. he drank and hung out there until in the morning. he says he drove the two girls home, went to his own house, and drove back to take one of them to work in the morning. i might be too sensitive, but i had a horrible day overall and this stressed me out more. why are you taking out two girls to do the things you do with me and more? if that was really all that happened, why lie about it to begin with? you re so eager to tell me about all the other dumb shit you do. it is am and i can not sleep. because i still do not think i will wake up if i do.	moderate
you ever feel miserable even though everything is perfectly fine? it is the early afternoon and i have two hours left in my shift. it is quiet around here, i took a quick walk around the building and everything felt strangely calm. the air is warmer than usual and it is starting to feel more like spring. everything felt good about that, and yet all i can think about is how empty everything feels. life feels so vacan not anymore at this point. my job has no real purpose because i just fix technology, and technology does not exist when the power is off, so in that case i would just be some guy with nothing to do. i want to feel useful, or like i exist for a reason, but instead i feel trapped due to safety. my job is safe, and my anxiety prevents me from reaching out of the comfort zone. my depression tells me i can not. i do not know where to begin, but i can not help but feel like i am running out of time.	moderate

loneliness strikes with a vengeance against toxic people everyday gets worse and worse and it only gets harder and harder. i just want to reconcile my friendships and prove that i can be a better person, and a worthy friend... but it is too late, and i should just move on but i can not i thought i was close with those people, when in reality i was not. i thought my actions would repeatedly be excused, but they weren t. i do not know how or why i have become this way and i would do anything to undo it... but, i am a borderline so things like this are destined to happen. i miss the fun and laughs and memories so much. i am trying to get them to talk to me with stupid strategies that i know arent going to work because i am too scared to apologize and tell them that i will be a better person because i feel like they would not care, and it would not matter. what is done is done and they will forever remember as a toxic and mean person who could not control their anger or behavior, but while i was shouting insults, saying slurs, and overall just being a hateful person, in my head i was thinking what is wrong with me? why am i acting like this and why can not i stop it? why i can not control myself? and obviously that is not a good excuse for what i have done, but they weren t the only ones hating me in those moments. i am going to be alone forever, and i should not get my hopes up when i make friends like this again because it is always going to have the same outcome. the pain and loneliness and rejection is all too familiar, but strikes with the same power it did just a few months ago when my best friend blocked me on everything and told me i would never be in his life again. maybe it is happening again because i deserve to pay for all my anger and toxicity, for projecting my own insecurities onto other people. anyways, that is all. the moral of the story is that i am never going to have a stable group of friends because of my own shitty behavior that i can not control, and sooner or later people will start to get tired of it and cut me off or ignore me. i just want to know how to better myself. i hate the person i have become. why has this happened to me? i have always struggled with behavioral issues and mental illness my entire life, and it seems that those things still and forever will haunt me to this day. not a day passed where i think about killing myself for the greater good of the world. i do not deserve to be here, no one likes me anyways.	moderate
imagine having a brain that just functions normally wow, just like. wow. i have been thinking about this lately, how i have drawn the familial short straw and just like every woman before me, i have ended up with treatment resistant depression. it is just so bizarre. we can find out the most amazing stuff how animals think and what the world is made of. we can send cute little robots to other motherfucking planets and we can do all of this awesome shit but we can not figure out why some people get the big sad? are you kidding me? you know how the earth was formed and people evolved over millions of years but not why my brain makes serotonin but then refuses to use it slowly rather than quickly? or maybe that is not even it!!! maybe i have a dopamine problem. who. fucking. knows. everyone else is brains can do those things. surely it can not be that complicated. our brains can develop languages and build societies but they are so stupid they can not regulate their own chemicals ?!!! ugh. if and when the day comes that science can do a brain transplant, sign me tf up. who needs my trash personality anyway, there is no use to having it if i can not use it properly because my brain is basically the equivalent of an ape that is been partially lobotomised.	severe
i feel like i should not be depressed? for about the last or so years, i have slipped in and out of depression. it kind of started midway through high school, about the time i was starting to think about college. i have two older siblings, one, my brother, years older, the other, my sister, years older. around the end of my sophomore year, my brother sat down with me in my room and we hung out, and he told me about how he kind of got depressed in high school, and that he didnt want the same to happen to me. it hit me really hard, and i tried, but i could not stop it. winter of junior year was probably the hardest, as it was the most i ever thought about suicide went to a bridge over a frozen river and sat on the edge for a while thinking about whether anyone would give a shit. around the same time, my sister was being very hard on me, and to me it just felt like she didnt believe in my ability to make it to college, and that she though she was so much better. this ended up persisting for a long time, getting worse, to the point where i didnt really talk to her if i didnt have to. it peaked on a vacation, when i was upset. i slammed a car door, and my dad yelled at me, so i yelled back. then my sister said what the hell is your problem and i shouted back, your the last fucking person i want to talk to. some weeks later she texted me, and we talked it over, she made up, but didnt seem to make any progress. now we are still in a similar situation, where i find it very hard to forgive her. at this point i dont know if i am depressed from family shit or high school shit, but i always feel like i have no one to talk to about it. i have a loop i go through with myself where i get depressed, dont want to talk about it, think about acting out hinting at it to people to get them to pry it from me. then i think no, you re just begging for attention and dont do anything, and suppress it. i know it isnt healthy, but i can not kick myself out of that pattern. my girlfriend of years tries to help me by being there, but i shut her out, because i dont know how to explain how i feel. i dont know if i am asking for help, or just writing this to try to get it out, but there. thanks. tl dr i am depressed, but i always feel like if i try to talk to ppl about it, i am just seeking attention, so i dont.	moderate
complete thissatisfied human being. so i am a bit excited about doing a post about it. i am struggling from severe depression since i am . i am also not the one who is crying over things happened in the past. it is about my condition i have been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it. everyday i wake up with great thissatisfaction. always in a bad mood. no motivation at all. always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. i have lost interest in nearly everything drawing, music, singing... not knowing what to do, i fear the future ahead of me. i was once totally into design... thought this is what i am going to do. however, i have also lost the interest in it. it was a gradual change and i can not even explain why it happened since i was always passionate about it. now i am sitting there day by day everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. i feel like i fell into an abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. i do not know who i am neither am i satisfied with how the situation is not changing. i tried meditation once. it was a good experience. but i am not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation. do not get me wrong. i am really grateful for what i have. being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. i do not like it fancy. i just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again. does someone experienced the same? what did you do to get out of it?	severe

coming out about your mental illness i have been battling debilitating social anxiety and depression for years. the past few months have been extremely rough for me. only my brother knows about this. i visit a handful of friends and family for holidays each year. this year however, my people are realizing that something is wrong. i have become a lot quieter and i no longer enjoy things i previously did i no longer enjoy anything to be honest . i had managed to fake happiness in the past but now i am really struggling. i kept getting questions as to why i am so numb to everything. i lied saying i had flu the week before and not feeling . i needed suggestions whether or not i should confess to my family and friends? the reasons i did not do it till now are mental health awareness is very poor in my country. my family would likely think i am faking it or everybody feels low sometimes afraid of being judged by the very few friends i have left. i am also afraid they might leave me eventually i really do not want people to pity me any advice is appreciated.	moderate

i do not see any other way out trigger warning hi everyone, my depression has been getting worse for the past year or so to the point now i feel like suicide is the only possible way for me. when i try to think about the future, my mind just goes blank. the feeling of waiting for the inevitable with so little motivation and so much negativity has completely taken over my life. my psychiatrist told me to go jogging because exercise is the best way to beat depression. due to the corona virus, he told me to play games, watch videos, listen to music instead. when i said that i was not motivated, he had a look of thisappointment on his face and told me i could not do nothing and expect improvements. the meds have not been working very well either so i am going downhill fast. i am still going through a breakup so right now my psychiatrist is the only person i trust like . i wouldn t be able to go out even if corona virus was not a thing. i do not know what to do. even if i were able to survive this, i still wouldn t want to live the rest of my life. i hate this world, the lies, the hypocrisy, selfishness, rudeness. i feel like i am holding onto something that does not even exist. what do you think i should do at this point? thank you. stay strong everyone lt 	moderate

i have only ever had one female friend in high school, i feel like most females do not like introverts. i am a year old muslim pakistani dude born and raised in america. for as long as i can remember, i have only had one true female friend who would actually care about me, invite me to stuff, etc and that was in high school. i would usually have been quite confident and in my own life but suddenly this year i have got this depressive feeling like everyone is fake, no one cares. i talk to females and they only enjoy small talk, before i can even say anything they friend zone me. i hear all the time about hookup culture, my friend came on to me what are we? , texting buddies, etc. how do you even? am i supposed to be this confident guy and just approach women randomly in the mall and be like hey, i think you re attractive, let us drink! i feel like offing myself and sometimes i just feel like finding an escort because at least i could say that i have gotten laid and in a way that ll boost my confidence and i could learn a thing or two.	not depression
i do not know what to say here everything is a fucking lie. my gf who broke up with me, my friends, my parents caring. it is all just a lie. i can not trust anyone without getting hurt. i had a gf for weeks before she decided to leave me when i did nothing wrong. i gave her so much love and affection like she wanted and it just was not enough for her. nothing is ever enough for people. i have never ever had affection from anybody before. and now that it is gone, i can not find a reason to want to move on. people say oh, it is going to get better or just hang in there . no. it is not going to get better, i can not just hang in there. i just can not. my parents take away my phone cause i told them i did not want to eat dinner and my flips out. she starts yelling at me blaming my phone for it saying i have become addicted to it when i used it this afternoon for only like fucking hours! and then she just goes to yell at my brother for what ever reason. and she is started to threaten to take my job away too. all i want now is loving parents, and a relationship that feels and is real. i am fucking sick and tired of the fucking bullshit i have to deal with in relationships and it breaks my heart to the point where i can not feel anything anymore. my mind hates my ex, but my heart wants to get back with her and i do not know what to do anymore. everybody pretends to care about me. everybody pretends to like me. i know they do not actually, i just go with it to try and trick myself into thinking they do. i do not see a future for me. i do not know why i try to go on anymore. and i just do not want to. but i am to much of a fucking pussy to do it. i have not met one irl person i did not hate in some way. i have not met on person i gave all my trust to. people just think they can just make fun of me, beat me up, and think i would not do anything about it. i do not know the only thing that feels real is schizophrenia. i never had the voices make fun of me. they never put me down. i know there no more real than the people, but they feel more real. i just do not know any more what is real and what is not.	not depression

could someone help me understand this? i feel so numb. i am years old now and from what i can remember, about half way through secondary school years old i started to change. i started not wanting to be around my friends anymore and gradually reduced my friendship group until it was just me and someone else. i started not wanting to go to family events and i just wanted to stay in my room on my own. this horrible empty feeling gradually increase and surrounded me wherever i went. i started to forget simple things that before i could easily remember and do no problem. this ruined my confidence entirely and my motivation and drive for things i enjoyed doing just did not exist all of a sudden. it is as if everything i previously enjoyed doing or had any interest in was not worth the time and effort. after the last years of secondary school i went to college and studied to become an electrician. at that stage my mind was blank so i just picked the course because i knew i had to do something. i met a guy in my class called callum and i was brave enough to tell him what had been going on in my head throughout the last few years. to my surprise, he related to some of the things i need saying and eventually told me that he was trying to figure out a way to tell his parents that he is not feeling well . i looked in to it and found out that a lot of the things him and i had talked about had a chance of relating to depression and anxiety, at which point i thought i would try and gather my balls and tell my parents. after crying, stumbling over my words and snotting everywhere, i managed to tell my parents that i am suffering, to which, in a nut shell, they responded with ah you ll be alright, you re still growing so your emotions will be all over the place for a bit . considering i explained in pretty good detail that every night i would pray that i would die in my sleep, i was pretty confused that they did not understand me that well. so after this shitty story of how i started to realise that i may have a dark brain, i ask this. any of your guys and girls out there that do suffer, would you be open to share some of your stories so that maybe we could understand a little bit more of how things build up? although one of those things we do not always like talking about, it might release a little bit of panic and stress knowing someone else can read and possibly relate to your story.	moderate
how do i get help? i m suspect that i have depression. i feel tired and sad all of the time, and doing small things exhaust me, which has caused me to fall far behind on my schoolwork. i have also had most of the causes for depression happen to me, such as death to a loved one my dad , abandonment my mom , and sexual and physical abuse my aunt . i now live with my grandparents who are very strong believers that all or most mental illnesses are just people wanting attention. how do i get help without being judged or ridiculed by them?	moderate
i have a bad crush, and it triggered a heavy downward spiral. i spiraled down hard today, and seeing as i do not really have anyone to talk to, i am going to post this here and hope it helps. here goes. it is about a girl, mostly. well, to back up just a bit, it is important to note that i have severe, persistent, medication resistant depression. i have tried a handful of meds, and not only did they not even begin to help, but they all had side effects ranging from uncomfortable to severe. i started taking cbd oil, and that has actually helped a ton. i am not saying there is not a med that will work for me, but i have not found it yet. i have suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life. i am currently on thisability because of my conditions. so there is just a little background for ya. months ago, i started a program to become certified in a job in the healthcare field. it is taken me a long time to get to this point. i quit my job, broke up with my girlfriend, and moved back in with my parents about and a half years ago. i decided i needed real help and that i needed to go back to school. i have been going to school very slowly and gradually built up to being able to handle a real work load. this past fall i was accepted into a program. the program completion is about years away. on the first day of the program, i met this girl. she was stunning. i am not going to give a ton of identifying detail in this post, but needless to say that i was immediately attracted to her. of course, i thought about asking her out, but, being the depressed person that i am, i immediately thought that she is out of my league. i also thought about the fact that if it does not go well, we will be stuck in the same classes, day in and day out, for the next years. i guess i was afraid that it would be unprofessional or awkward. two weeks go by before we see each other again and classes actually start. on the first day of class, she sat next to me and almost immediately teases me. now i am like, great. she is beautiful and witty. this sucks. over the next few days i come to find out that she is very intelligent, as well. she is kind she is fit she is an athlete she has a smile that makes me weak. it is honestly hard to look directly at her. this is a bit of a ramble. the point is that i developed a huge crush on her. and it has not gone away. i thought perhaps that it would be an infatuation that would fade over time, but instead i find myself thinking about her constantly. i am typically an indecisive, hesitant person, in general. the idea of asking this girl out, though, was just too enormous. what if she rejects me? what if we go out on one or two dates and then she rejects me? what if we actually date for a decent amount of time but then we break up and we re stuck in this program together? i do not want things to be awkward. i do not want the rumors and the drama and the appearance of unprofessional behavior. i do not want the thistraction from this very difficult program. when would i even find the time to attempt such a relationship? there were just too many variables. after a while, though, those questions and concerns seemed to matter less and less. they were still there, but i started to come around to the idea that i needed to do something. i could not just have this crush and be in agony. i needed to act. i decided i would invite her out to hang out as friends, and if things went well, i would ask her out. not a bad idea, right? i would look for signals and see if we have a real connection outside of school. i saw her today at school. she came in and sat by me and another classmate, for no reason. she really just came in to hang out with us. she is done this several times, and this is part of the reason that i think there might be something there. but is she coming in to see me or my classmate? or am i overthinking this? i am probably overthinking this. we were working together for a few hours, but she says she has to stop real quick and let her friend in to the building. she mentions it is a him. i immediately thought, oh no. she is going to bring in some tall, broad, stud of a smoke show, and she is going to show me what her type really is. i am a skinny guy. i am fit. i play sports. i have some decent muscle tone on my chest and abdomen, but i am skinny. i do not have big arms. i am about she is actually about the same height as me. she is quite tall , but i am not super tall. i weigh about . i am a skinny guy. it is something that has always bothered me about myself. so anyway, in walks this tall, broad, stud of a smoke show. fuck. my mind immediately went to a dark place. this guy is her type. i do not know why i ever thought i would be her type. she is tall and beautiful. she does not want to be with some scrawny guy that is not even taller than her. look at this fuckin guy. he is a fuckin linebacker. of course he is. oh awesome. hey what is up buddy? you re also being super charming and funny? cool. cool cool cool cool coooool. fuuuck. what was i even thinking? i finished up what i was doing and got the hell out of there. i did not say bye. i just snuck out. i then proceeded to kick my own ass all the way home. i have never been so thisgusted with myself. i would not go into my exact thinking, but it was some dark stuff, and it was a long drive home. when i got home, i immediately crawled into bed. i could not do anything. i could not get on the internet i could not watch a movie i could not sleep i could not eat i could not read a book i was in depression purgatory. i basically stayed in bed from the time i got home until i eventually forced myself to eat, and now i am here. i am just so very down. i do not really have anyone to talk to. i have very few friends, and i do not think i can talk to any of them about this. i am alone.	moderate

 year progress when i was , i was exposed to psychological bullying at school. i walked away from all my friends. after a while i got depressed. i pulled myself out of people. during this period, i became friends with my depression. for some reason i did not want to get rid of it. i felt good with it ridiculously. at , i tried to harm myself. then i realized how ridiculous it was. during this time, my social anxiety started. my family was worried about me. i went to many psychologists, but i did not see any benefit. my mom refused me to use medication. i did not want it either. because everything was ending in my head. i struggled for years. i have not been out for months. when i got on the subway, my heart was pounding and i was having trouble breathing. i do not remember how many times i got off from the subway and got into another one because it was crowded. i forgot how to talk to people. my hands were shaking every time. after a while i got bored with this situation. people thought i was doing it to get attention. this made me feel like shit. i made some friends. they approached me first. then i approached them without noticing. i went out with them. i started talking to people but still my hands were shaking. i showed my real personality to people. i do not care what they think. if i got angry, i was making it clear. i just did not show when i was upset. i am years old now. i got rid of my depression. my social anxiety is over. i can now go public. i can talk to people. but i am still not going out alone. i believe that this will also pass over time. all will pass over time, friends. we will all have a happy life eventually.	not depression

new to sub, but not to depression i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression as a teenager. i have gone off and on treatment over the years. currently on welbutrin, buspar, and klonipin with counseling. i have been with my husband over years. last year he was diagnosed in his s with severe adhd. last week he was also diagnosed with bipolar. we have been living separately for about weeks. i have not told anyone other than my counselor. obviously things were spiraling badly for us to get to this point. he never physically hurt me but was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive. it felt like only a matter of time. i used to self harm and have passive suicidal ideation frequently, which my counselor is aware of. my partner says he wants to get help and is set to start cognitive behavioral therapy and medication next weekish. this whole journey really started years ago when i could not take his mothers shitty treatment of me anymore and our friend killed himself and i asked him to get counseling. now here we are years later, all these changes and resources and everything still sucks so much. i can not even tell my family. they have their own issues and lives and are across the country. now another friend committed suicide over christmas and all i can think about is what a miserable piece of shit i am with a miserable life and how nice it would be not to live it anymore. i am just really down over it all. i tried to be a friend to my partner but i think he just hates me. he lives in our detached garage and i do not know why he treats me the way he does. i just wish i had a friend or literally anyone there for me.	severe
my dad died last sunday. they actually think it was around thursday but did not find him til sunday. he died of congested heart failure which my uncle died of almost years ago to the month. he was having a lot of health issues and was going to see a doctor last thursday but died before that ever happened. i had not talked to him in almost years. i am now and have not seen him since i was . we were best friends when i was a kid but kinda grew apart as i got older as i live in arizona and he lived in washington state. i guess the longer it got the harder it got to pick up the phone. i now hate myself for not reaching out. he was only . i just want to hug him and tell him sorry but that will never happen. it is weird after not talking to him for so long. never thought i would miss him this much. i feel so lost and alone. not even sure if anyone is going to read this but just had to tell someone. i have not been able to sleep. i have work in a few hours and i am just lying in my bed bawling my eyes out. i just want it to end so i can see him again.	moderate

i do not know what to do i suffer from types of diagnosed depression, anxiety, amp ptsd. i just moved last week, into a home with my new bf of one year . it felt kind of soon to move in, but there are circumstances that made it beneficial. i am in debt because of the move. so i did not pay my insurance, i figured i could push it off for a month while i got out of debt. needless to say, without insurance i ran out of meds an i am not currently on my rx and now, thanks to coronavirus, i am on leave until further notice. no one knows when. stressed is an understatement. and the depression keeps hitting me in waves. i am not sure what to do, if there is even anything i can do?	severe

my perspective please listen to me and do not ban before listening. all of this anguish, pain, self doubt, and hopelessness has cursed us, we have even been thrown into the darkest depths of emotional emptiness, nothing to fight for, nothing to live for, there seems like there is no salvation, we are abandoned. trust me i have felt it. but is not it beautiful, is not it the most poetically glorious thing, when the soldier walks through the trenches of hell, through bombardments of demonic fire, the strongest adversary he has ever faced in his life, losing friends and limbs. it seems like he will never be whole again, but forty years later, maybe fifty, he is sitting in his old wooden chair, his grandchildren playing in the yard, and finally, there it is, strangely... peace, freedom, everything he had fought through has led him here, but he had to fight like hell, he had to push through, he had stared death himself in the face and had the guts to stick it to him. why let it all go now? yes you may never be able to achieve your ultimate dreams, yes you may never meet your dream partner, yes you may not even reach your goals or the expectations of others, no matter how hard you try, that is reality, but that is just how it is, but there is a life out there, and it is better than death, one that is not as painful and shit and unbearable as it is now, there percent is, maybe as a school teacher, maybe even a construction worker with all your construction worker buddies, maybe you find something you are good at, ju jitsu, painting, music, maybe you find a friend you love spending time with, maybe you finally meet a girl or boy with great effort, maybe step by step after years you overcome the social anxiety, maybe you build yourself in the gym and form a body you never thought you could have, maybe you could get a job that you are atleast content with, and you can use that money to help and improve others, it may not be a life of glamour, but it is something. and when you set those goals, and you work towards them with everything you have, every single hour, second put in, with every blood sweat and tear poured in and you finally make it, with little goals like this, wouldn t it feel infinitely better? and when you had walked through the roaring fires like those soldiers before you, and you re standing on the peak, the peak you have for yourself, you will know that you have made it, you made something of your life, there is not only emptiness, at that point, i promise, it will have all been worth it. the weak die by giving up, suicide? no such thing, that is pathetic, we all fade away in the end, no matter where you are or where you who you will end up like those who have given up, but what differienciates you? you fought, you stayed when those weaker than you could not, be rich or die trying, be happy or die trying, you have the right to be happy, and if this life derives you of it, the fight, you may not make it, but atleast you did not go out like a coward and who knows, maybe you will make it, if not now, than in or or years but it will and can happen!	moderate
i do not know what to do this post is just going to be me blabbering away, and i am sorry. i am in my senior year at high school, but i am afraid i would not be able to graduate due to my many days of absence, and not having been able to work much with school, because i have been struggling a lot with depression. since christmas i have been at school maybe a couple of weeks combined. i know i am not stupid, but i feel like such a huge waste of potential. not that i am a genius or anything, but i should at least be able to graduate with decent grades. my entire country have switched to online schools for a few weeks now, and i thought not having to go to school, and being able to work from home would be easier. but it is not. when i log onto the learning platform i am completely overwhelmed and just end up sitting there in my room, feeling horrible. all of my friends know what they are going to do next year, and i do not even know if i am going to graduate this year. i can not imagine things turning out alright for me, and i can not imagine a proper future for myself either. i do not know what to do. i feel like my depression is eating away at such a huge part of my life. and i know people say that you are not your illness , but how can that be true when it affects such a huge and major portion of your life? i have been struggling with depression on and off since i was , and i just do not see it getting any better. i usually do not post, but i just needed to get this off my chest. i am sorry if i sound whiny. i am also sorry if my english is incorrect, it is not my first language. thank you for reading i hope you are all doing well, and if you re not doing well, i hope things will get better soon.	moderate
am i depressed? i know other posts already exist with this query, yet, even still i doubt myself. to put context, i am , and i have found myself increasingly less motivated in most of what i do, and almost completely incapable to pick myself up to take a pencil to paper for the homework of my classes. it is building up even now while i despair, yet no matter what i am drawn to simply sitting around, to waiting. i do not know when specifically this began. last year? the year before? i could technically even say the signs of noticeable lack of motivation, harsh self critique and occasional days of inexplicable fatigue began somewhere around the end of middle school, and i would almost say it was the cause of my first c grade which for me was an absolute failure and evidence that i am just lazy as it came from a lack of doing homework in english, yet trying to say that makes me feel like it is an unforgivable attempt of brushing the failure off with an excuse. although i have once admitted a desire for self harm and only glanced upon the chances of depression with her, we had assumed it to be from the use of acutane, which is of course known to cause a variety of psychological issues. however, now it is been over half a year since i quit the heavy acne medicine, and i am still carrying these potential symptoms. if anything, to a severely worse scale. i do, though, still have my positive days. in fact, i have quite a few. to add further, i have an intense interest in writing that has not been dulled by any of this. in fact, it is only grown. if there is any class that i have not been falling behind in yet, it would be my current american literature class, simply for my love of reading and writing. i guess if anything, i have been using this as an excuse of see? you re happy. you re fine. you re just making an excuse for procrastinating. ...thing is, by now i would have usually brought myself back up. i have always noticed a trend with myself in dipping in performance in school, only to recover and pass with as and bs, long before i even hit an f. right now, though, i have failed two classes lately and am probably due to fail another two if this continues... i really only ask this to confirm whether or not i should thiscuss with my parents on seeking treatment. it just feels like such a drastic and wasteful thing to commit if it turns out i am somehow using this as an excuse.	moderate
deep down truthfully i do not want to get better because i do not believe it is possible. it just does not matter. i do not believe i will ever not hate myself. the best i can not do is neurotically lie to myself as a defensive mechanism just because it is to painful to sit with my self. i can pretend i am doing better but let us all be real i am not. the most comical posts on this sub are the i am leaving this sub posts translation i found a defense mechanism that will work for days and now i pretend to have all this wisdom to further keep convincing myself i am not depressed, magically medications gave me self esteem! shit is a joke. of those people post again here within the week or just get mad when there pride is hurt again. i just do not care anymore. it is never not gotten worse for me in my life. it always gets worse. i can not talk to people, i can not get through shifts at work, i regress into child like states of mind where i feel like i can not think independently. i am always on and off a host of drugs. i do not even know what is real half the fucking time. i do not have any passions or emotions. i only have enough interest in an activity to the point where it will cover up my pain, not because i want to do it. anything and everything i do is just to mask the pain. i am toast and always was	moderate

i just want to cry alone. holy shit things went bad fast. last year i went into deep depression, however i recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. i got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. however the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. my parents decided they wanted to try some parenting and decided i spent too much time on video games . even though i really only played hours a night. it was one of the main ways i interacted with my friends as well. after that they decided that my phone was thistracting me so it was confiscated as soon as i got home from school. then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. the worst part is i do not even know why they are doing all of this. my grades were good, a is and b is and in ap classes while working hours a week and maintaining a social life. everything was going so good. now i get home and feel empty and alone. i can not even cry in privacy. then they have the audacity to ask honey whats wrong, why are you sad????? . i just dont understand.	moderate
is there anything you genuinely enjoy in life big or small? is losing joy just growing up too early? i know this is a hard question to ask a depressed person, but this is something that i want myself to sit and think about and hopefully others in this subreddit and i feel like talking about it will help at least a few. i am sitting here in my cold room looking at all the stuff i like to keep me busy, guitar, videogames, social media anything on my phone, my friends, my family, books. i enjoy all of this stuff but when i look back at the happiest moments in my life i either do not get the chance to do what i love anymore, or i just do not love the few things that did used to make me happy. now i just sit in my room thinking about what i can do different, but at the same time, i do not think doing things different will change how i feel. where did my imagination as a kid go? my favorite thing was pretending i was a super hero. i used to spend hours playing games as a kid never getting bored. i used to love running, now i can not even convince myself to go for a walk, i used to work out too and i fucking loved that. hikes too now i need someone to invite me to even think about doing that. i used to spend hours a day on my guitar reading everything about it and learning a lot. hell even finding a good show on netflix was enjoyable. i used to be worried about finding someone i liked, and i did, but trying to find someone else? it is been years and i do not care. now? i can not be bothered and currently i like it better that way and i hate that.	not depression

does anyone else have an issue of not being able to cry when they are sad or upset? like most of everyone in the subreddit. i struggle with depression. bad enough that back in september friends were worried about me and had me admitted to a psychiatric hospital. since then i have been off work and doing the whole psychiatrist for meds which are helping. i feel better than i have in a while. i am also seeing a therapist twice a week to work on the psychological issues of past traumas, some of which i did not even know or realized i would been through. but one of the biggest things i have thiscovered is that regardless of how sad or upset or depressed in the deepest dark pit of my mind when it gets out of my control. i do not cry. even though i feel an urge too. nothing happens. so i was curious if anyone else experiences this. and if so and you have been able to fix this issue how did you do so?	not depression

i just need to vent since i have no friends anymore i just need to vent with the more i talk about it to other people i am realizing how manipulative and abusive the friend i cut off a couple months ago was. every time i think of her i realize one more thing she did that affected me on a deep level. i only have friends now since i cut her off, they are both at college so i am alone for now. i still miss my ex even though it is almost been a year. i still love her, i adore her. i can not be happy when she is not here, her shadow clings fo every thing i do. i know i will never be happy or in love again. i have chronic fatigue , chronic pain, and a heart condition so every day is a struggle. i spend everyday in pain. i worry about money to pay bills every single month, i never feel relaxed. my immune system is practically destroyed from eating thisorders. i think about suicide everyday and nothing gets better. i am so off track of my personal goals for life. everyone says i am still young and all that shit, but i have spent a decade being miserable who is to say the next decade would not be shit and the one after that and the one after that. if we look at the evidence plain and simple, life is bound to follow the same pattern of getting worse and worse as it has thus far. i do not know what to do, i am so extraordinarily miserable but also numb at the same time. i do not have hope, and i do not want to continue.	moderate

struggling hey everyone. it is the new year, and like a lot of people around here i am really struggling. if everything goes well, i will have years sober. i guess without the alcohol and the drugs i am just left with myself, and that is the problem. without the drugs and alcohol i just can not seem to make the slightest effort to make meaningful relationships with people. i still go to meetings but even in a room full of people i can feel so alone. i do not have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now i guess i have isolated myself so much that i just do not know how to talk to people. i drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. i do not know how i will go through this year. i just hope i can make it to the three years in march. thanks for reading. i do not expect people to really care, but i guess i just needed to get this off my chest. i hope everyone else has a better new year than i did.	moderate
can you be helped if you can not or do not want to help yourself? as the months pass i am starting to care less and less about things or people in my life. i have people who love me that i am close with but i do not feel genuine emotion any more, i just understand when i should and act accordingly. i pretend to my friends and family that i am better than i am because talking about it does not help. i do not want to commit suicide because of my mother, no one should have to bury their child but i can not predict how much longer this barrier will be enough. i feel soon this will be overwhelming. i am a shade of the person i used to be. for the first few years of my depression i maintained a hope that i would get better given time and effort, i was optimistic even though i felt like shit. i do not feel this any more. even if i were to feel better with time or effort i do not care any more. i do not want to be better i just want to die. i feel a stain on my soul like this feeling will be permanently ingrained in my mind. i think about suicide so often it is like an automatic process that i do not even realize is happening most of the time. i am tired.	severe
happy fucking new year i have been struggling with a major depressive episode since about . not my first, but maybe the worst since my first in when i made my first pathetically failed suicide attempt. for most of the next years i hid it apparently successfully until a thissociation crisis in dec scared me enough to take another chance on the local mental health system despite the significan not risk their antiquated attitudes to mental illness would cost me my job and maybe my family. a few months later, i finally told my wife, who is local, and was treated to a lecture about how i am weak, how everyone has problems, how i was stupid to let the doctors trick me into taking pills when all i needed was good friends and a hobby. i brushed it off, and worked it anyway. this time last year i was in full remission and came off the meds. and i was doimg great, feeling more like me than i had in decades. but the weeks became months, and the months added up, and by the time summer came i was painfully aware of how thisconnected we were. some of that is definitely due to my depression the sour moods, the pulling away but more was because she had just refocused in ways that excluded me from her life. and when i look back, i realised that half my problem had been that when things were worst i no longer felt safe reaching out to her. in august i started slipping again, in october i needed to gp back on meds, by the end of november my doctprs gave me anti psychotics just in case the urge to self harm or suicide got too much to manage. an now it is a new year. i had a long break over christmas so i wanted to visit family and friends back home. she and the kids did not come. and it is been so good. the enthusiasm and love from friends and family is incredible. i have not felt so loved and wanted in so long. that is a problem. today i realised that depression has killed my marriage. i do not know how we can get back from here, but i know the sense of isolation and the lack of partnership is a big part of why i relapsed. getting bavk might literally be impossible. and now i am stuck with an impossible decision on top of already having days when i really, really wish it would all just end.	severe

something beautiful i found in youtube comments i know, right and just wanted to share it with you guys here it goes the most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways except towards themselves. always remember this. when you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, do not take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early. just pull them aside and let them know it is alright and that we are all lost here. that is all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that does not matter, and truly connect with them even if just for a second to have a human moment. even subtle eye contact can do it. just do not let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. because they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world. depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds for to them, they are alone. cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can not connect even for a second. and all they want is to be loved. to legitimately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. they need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves. they have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. they realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. to them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. but without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet still feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a tv show and a bowl of ice cream. i just thought i can brighten up someone is day as it did mine, be strong yall.	not depression

i have been suffering with chronic depression diagnosed by doctor but can not bring the strength to tell my friends so i call it brain fog becuase i have to talk about it somehow. i have been suffering from chronic depression for the past years and it is the worst thing ever but i have managed to bring it to a swinging sort of thing where it only happens maybe to times a week but each time it happens it can last up to weeks at least that was the longest one for me . the only person who knows is my mom and doctor but i have to talk to my friends and girlfriend about it but i just can not bring myself to tell them so when it happens i get all angry because that is how i cope with it but also it hurts me so bad and all i want to do is just lie on the ground and just cry but i have to keep going and keep pushing through because i have to many responsibilities to just stop doing everything. and i constantly want to die but i keep thinking about my mom and girlfriend and friends. so basically in order to talk about it i say that i am having brain fog which is basically something i made up in order for my friends to sort of understand and sympathize with me. also last sunday i almost drove off the highway.	severe

i am falling back into depression and i do not know what to do so i am in my early s, i am cis female and i am lesbian. i have severe anxiety but i am a musician so i interact with a lot of different people. i always try to be nice to people and move on with my life. i am a private person so i do not ask too much about others and expect the same in return. so basically this dude dms me and says he likes my music, i thank him for the support and send him an unreleased track which is not abnormal for me, i send my music to anyone who will listen . so one day i do a qna and he asks me, how does p!ssy taste? this shakes me up kinda because even though i do not hide my sexuality, i keep it to myself and do not go into detail. i tell him to never ask me something like that again and says he understands, i brush it off as a one time occurrence. i decide to start to dry text more than i usually do, avoid, and thistance. one day he dms me again, and is like, check my story. i tell him that there is no way i am doing that without knowing whats on the story. he tells me he plans on dropping his ex girlfriend is nudes but tells me whats on his story is just a fight, i shut him down immediately and tell him what he wants to do is illegal. i do not click the story and i move on. the last occurrence was after he sent me a meme. i sent him a emoji hoping to end the conversation naturally then out of no where he is like, this girl tried to send me titty pics but got mad when i said i did not care again, i shut him down and was like, i do not want to talk about this and i am not the person to speak to on this. he says he understands and is like, i respect that, i am just really young so i do not understand things like that. that freaks me out, like this dude knew i do not thiscuss sexual things. i just tell him, everyone has boundaries . he described me as family friendly to my face. i do not know anything about this person, he did mention something about being three in when nicki minaj was famous but i have no way of verifying that. so that brings me to recent events, i end up telling him to stop contacting me i made a public post about leaving me alone that was partially at him and to set firm boundaries . out of morbid curiosity i go onto his twitter. i see an omegle chat where he claims to be but who really knows, i scroll down and i see that he is tweeted out pornhub videos which is something i do not see very often . i go onto his likes and at first it is just some sports stuff. i decide to scroll down some more and it goes from porn out of context clips to hentai, some weird hentai too like girl being roughly screwed by humanoid pig creature porn. that is when it clicks why he did not respect my boundaries, it puts everything else into context as well. so that brings me to where i am right now. i feel conflicted. i feel like this is my fault because i did not research who this person fully was, granted i shut down certain topics if i felt like they were going in a direction i did not like. i handled it the best i could. i blocked him shortly after. i feel stupid and weak because i did not stand up for myself but i just assumed it was going to end up being a one time event and the first time was a simple misunderstanding. i minimized, i will be real. i know i sound stupid but i feel like a slipped up and let a boundary of mine be thisrespected, i had just been trying to not go off on people and be civil but it did not work. it makes me feel sick but at the same time guilty. my anxiety is telling me i did something illegal unintentionally. i feel somewhat violated by this whole experience but i feel shame because i am not sure how i should react. i feel weak because i should have stood up for myself.	moderate

i am turning into someone i hate just got told today that i might turn into a narssistic person just like my mother and sister. genetic, they said. i am turning into the people that ruined my childhood. i am turning into the people that made me hate myself. but, i guess, maybe i hate myself because i know i am turning into them. maybe i know it is inevitable. this is exactly why i want me to be gone. i want to die. i do not want to be them. i hate them. why am i turning into someone i hate? why? why should i live knowing that i will hate myself?	moderate

it seems like i can not be happy. a little backstory... i work jobs but i can not seem to get anywhere in life. i feel trapped. this week i worked well over hours. i do not think ill be able to pay all my bills. i want to go to uni but i can not find the time. i thought that my life would be better when i got out of the military no longer working super long days having time for a social life maybe meet someone but now it is worse. i am nearly at the end of my rope. i need to go to work tomorrow and ill be there for hours followed by another hours of working followed by another hours. i do not have time to sleep. i do not have time to read. i was trying to play board games with friends today but all i could think about was work and that my boss would yell at me again if i forgot something. i can not afford to take a day off. i am so lost.	moderate
no friends? did anyone have some nice friends only to lose them cause you never bothered to hang out with them since you were too depressed anxious tired etc? its rather frustrating and lonely not having anyone to talk to. feels impossible to find a good friend at this point. i guess it is my fault though.	not depression
i feel dumb and useless the job i work at always makes me feel like a bumbling idiot and it gets dirty and i just feel so gross and ugly all the time. my body thismorphia is back from when i was now . i look at other people and think about how content they are in their life and how they have good jobs and are achieving their dreams and being creative and i just feel like i am wasting away. i am smart and capable but right now it does not feel like it. i wish i could go back to being sweet and happy and almost effervescent but i am so depressed and i have no motivation. i have never felt so hopeless before. my mood is so low that it takes so much effort to take a shower or attempting to better my appearance. i really do not know how men find me attractive. my personality is not even there anymore for someone to like. it is just too hard right now to feel good about myself. i am so fucked up and it just feels like i am broken beyond repair. nothing matters to me and i am so calloused to my emotions that its better to just let them simmer away and be numb. and i want to get better so bad. i am taking meds and starting therapy but i just do not know how i can feel better.	moderate

ocd and depression i have ocd and not depression at least that is what i tell myself , though i guess the two are not mutually exclusive. it is isolating sometimes, i think that is where the sadness comes from. seeing friends is hard when there are nonsensical reasons that you can not go out after work. having hobbies can be hard when you can not get out of the bathroom. sleep is hard when the times you need to be in bed and out of bed do not allow for it. every time i get into a new hobby i am always worried, waiting for the moment i am going to have to leave it behind for some silly reason. i get scared about my intrusive thoughts, when they fixate on things like jumping off a building or walking in front of a car. i do not want to do those things but i am forced to fixate on them, looping the thoughts over and over. it is desensitising. weirdly, the rest of my life is doing fine, my job is great and only getting better. embracing my ocd helped me get where i needed to be. my partner is amazing and more than i could ever ask for. but i am petrified of the thoughts taking over and i lose myself to an off intrusion and end it all. i get angry at all my long term friends for being able to keep so close to one another while i sit in the shower again at home and dont talk to them for another two months. the worst part is i know the envy is silly. compulsions are lonely and i am sick of them.	not depression
it does not make a difference whether i am with my friends or not here goes nothing... so i am a second year international student in a uk university. i came here in and did not know anyone but made a friend at the airport, another international student. we were great together, we d go out and have our version of fun not clubbing like the majority of uni students cause i honestly hate it and i even met my now boyfriend when out with her. last summer she texted me out of nowhere saying she is dropping out. my grandma has also just passed away and honestly, i just felt like shit and cried for a few days i am not a crier. the beginning of second year was terrible, i felt lonely and depressed and the only one to snap me out of it was my boyfriend. he encouraged me to become better friends with people from my course and i did. it was all nice until a couple of days ago i had a bit of an argument with one of the girls in the group and now everyone is just avoiding me. if i ask a question directly to someone they will answer out of politeness but make it really awkward. when i left to go get lunch i said bye and no one answered. they all sat together and did not invite me over. at the end of the day, they all just left and did not say a word to me, even though i was right behind them. to make everything worse i am supposed to live with them next year and i have a hunch it is just going to be hell. oh, and my boyfriend is leaving town cause he is moving back in with his parents to save some money. his parents live really far away and i am just terrified i am going to lose him too. please give me some advice, i really do not know what else to do.	not depression
why can not i be happy i can not be happy i can not feel anything positive and i give up. i do not care about existing. i have written my suicide note and this is the end. goodnight and goodbye others. please take care.	not depression
is this depression or something else? really struggling. hello everyone, just to preface my doctor has diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ocd. recently i have been filled with self hatred. i am and weigh pounds. i am convinced i am fat even though this is a very average body weight. when i look in the mirror i think how ugly i am. people tell me i am attractive but i do not believe them. i feel like my life is a failure. i graduate college with a degree in fine arts and history with honors...this is not good enough. i feel as if i am very ignorant and perceived as such. i am have traveled abroad three different times...yet when others tell me about their travels i feel inadequate. my dreams and goals feel absolutely impossible. when ever i go out into public i think everyone hates me and is talking about me. i also constantly google mental illness and symptoms because i am convinced something is majorly wrong with me...even though three doctors have told me i am normal . i take multiple mental health quizzes everyday to see if i have lost my mind. i am constantly asking my coworkers at work what they think about me. i am an artist and believe every work i produce is garbage. even with people validating me i usually do not believe them. any advice?	moderate
ever need help, but do not trust anyone enough to actually ask for it? meeeeeeeeeee 	not depression
this is my first post, hope it is not my last. i have felt a little empty for quite a while. it just gets grouped up with everything i do and, i kinda forget about it? its times like these, when i am supposed to be celebrating that it gets to me. i do not feel anything, it is just, happening. i draw and whatever, but i stopped because i got bored with it. maybe its laziness. the only concrete hobby i have is the internet. soon winter break will be over and i am going to half to pretend like i am super energetic, cause i lied about it in the first place. people often complain about my unresponsiveness to stuff, they ask if i need help. but it is not a cut and dry that the saying? answer. do i need help? am i being overdramatic? i am probably not mentally ill. delete if necessary. amp x b amp x b but damn do i feel empty.	moderate
i do not want to die but i do not feel like living i have not been diagnosed. i do not even know if i have depression or just have depressed like feelings. i am comfortable. i am not stuck in a corner. i am doing quite ok in terms of life, work, friendship, family, relationship. but i have been waking up every day with a heavy feeling, like on the verge of crying. i have to be consciously present when i talk to other people even family members to showcase that i am not sad. i even process certain things like small talk or joke, so that i appear to socially function like everybody else. suicide is scary and i do not think i could do it but at the same time, i do not feel like living either. a thought popped in my head on what would i do in the event i receive news that i have a limit to my life expectancy and i seriously considered not to do anything and just proceed to die. i feel like i do not have anything to be super sad or depressed yet i really do want to just permanently thisappear. i am not saying my life is comfortable in all aspects, there are areas where my life really sucks but it is not a legitimate problem that it becomes an issue of survivability. yet, i feel lmthis heaviness and hopelessness nearly everyday. it makes me feel like shit because i do not have a reason to be like this when there are other people that are far more justified to be depressed and even they soldier on. the reason why i post here is because i can not go for therapy and i want to know what people are personally doing to improve their life. thanks in advance	moderate
very long. maybe too personal. but it is my truth. i used to think there were many things i would take to my grave, but for the first time in my life, i feel like i need to open up and talk about my feelings. i do not want you to pity me or send me heartfelt messages. i just want to be heard clearly. more importantly, i hope that if my words resonate with you, you ll take this moment to either help someone you know or seek help for yourself... deep breaths. calm my racing heart. alright. the feelings i have towards my parents are complicated. if they were shitty people in all aspects of their lives, i wouldn t feel guilty about hating them. however, they carry traits i admire, and there are many positive things they have done, not just for me but also for others. that is why i have a difficult time accepting my negative feelings for them. at times, it feels inappropriate for me to hate them, but other times, i feel like that is the only way i am capable of feeling towards them. for the majority of my life, but specifically the entirety of my childhood and youth, my dad was an alcoholic who would, on occasion, hit my mom while he was drunk. at that time, i was very young and i was still an only child. it did not matter to me that my dad was working while attending a competitive university. i did not care that he was struggling to balance his work life, academic life, and family life, all while dealing with the emotional strain that our financial situation caused. i did not care about how my dad was also struggling in his own way, but only hated him for how he treated my mom. my dad is also the type to move on from things quickly, whereas my mom holds grudges. so after hitting her, my dad would act like nothing happened the following day. this cycle was something that deeply angered not only my mom but also me. my mom worked she still works full time as a registered nurse. she makes more money than my dad. i often wondered why that did not give her the confidence to defend herself without crying, but then again, i will never know the pain of being coerced into an arranged marriage and having to move to another country to be with my husband, leaving my family behind in my native country. i think there was a lot of sadness in my mom is heart during the early years of her marriage as well as raising me. she got married at . my dad was . they had me three years into their marriage i was born in . when i think of my childhood, there is something in particular that always comes to mind. it happened multiple times back when my mom worked night shifts. she would hide my dad is alcohol and tell me not to tell him where it was. i agreed. however, once she left for work, my dad would approach me, all smiles. he asked me where his alcohol was. i told him i could not say. then, he said that he would buy me whatever i wanted. like an idiot, i agreed. every time. my dad never remembered the promises he made to me once he was sober again. almost years later, i can not help but shiver at how naive i was... as a kid, i did not eat much. two reasons one, i was not fussy. i never complained about being hungry, so other than getting fed when my mom was home, i did not really eat. you know how when you re a kid, your parents usually force you to eat? it is like that. because i never complained about being hungry, my mom would feed me simply because it was time to eat , but when she was not home, there was no one to feed me. the second reason i did not eat much is precisely that. my dad never checked on me when my mom left for work in the evening. i passed the time by watching tv, and sometimes i fell asleep early. but one time, i got bored and went upstairs to see what my dad was doing. he spent so much time on his computer, and he never even spared one look at me after i gave him his alcohol. so, that day, maybe i was looking for an answer. i stood outside my dad is room and looked inside. he was drinking a beer, looking at something on the computer. that much was not shocking. but i was completely confused by what i saw on the screen. looking back, even if i had seen it clearly, i wouldn t have known what it was. i was too young then. but the second my dad noticed me, he closed quickly the tab. he rushed me out of his office and locked the door after going back inside. i did not realize it was porn until i was in my late teens. it still haunts me to this day. i remember i went back to my room after that and i thought i would seen a thisney princess on the screen or something. i got excited thinking maybe my dad was looking up a doll or something to buy for me. why was i like that...? there was another episode that occurred when i was six years old. by then, i developed a habit of staying in my room even though i knew my parents were fighting. i heard multiple voices from my room. it sounded like my grandpa was coaxing my dad. my maternal grandparents lived with us at that time because my mom had gotten pregnant unexpectedly . my dad was very irritated and angry during her entire pregnancy. i do not really know why, but that day, i stepped out of my room and peeked into my parents bedroom where all the adults were gathered. my grandpa was pulling my dad is hand back. my mom had her hands around her throat, coughing drily. without a word, i went back to my room. my mom came into my room a few minutes later and locked the door. she spent a long time crying. i do not think i will ever forget that feeling. pathetic, helpless... something like that. but i do not know if those thoughts were directed at myself or my mom. however, the dynamics of our relationships all changed by the time i was a teenager. during my adolescence, my relationship with my parents turned very sour, especially with my mom. up until th grade, i did well in school. i had mainly as and bs. however, in th grade, i got my first c. it was in science. but there is something i need to explain before i go further. as i said, my mom is a nurse. my dad is a clinical laboratory scientist. both of those careers have a lot to do with science, and my parents were also really studious growing up. one could argue that it is because they are indian, but i think that is just their personality a result of their upbringing. they both work hard and never slacked off at school. my maternal grandma was a housewife. she got married at and did not have much of an education, but she still pushed my mom to study well so she could have a good career in the future. my dad came from a broken home. his mom died of ovarian cancer when he was , and his dad was an alcoholic who spent his time gambling. my dad was very close to his mom and loathed his dad for neglecting his parental duties. i always found this funny since my dad thisplayed a lot of behaviors similar to his dad when i was young, but whatever... since my dad has five siblings, there was even less money to go around. still, somehow, my paternal grandfather managed to send all of his kids to america. now, they all have good lives and good incomes. they were only able to come here and acquire a good job with the degrees they earned in india through hard work. it is because of this that my parents do not take school lightly. in america, k is free if you go to public school. in india, school is expensive at all ages. in kerala, many kids start school at age three, and they begin learning three languages at the beginning of grade school. the education there is also much more difficult and at a higher level than what is taught during k in america. the reason why i want to emphasize this goes back to what i said previously. i got my first c in th grade, and i was an anxious wreck when i went to show my mom my grade report. we had to have a parent sign it and then bring it back to school . because my parents schooling was much more difficult and competitive than what i was dealing with, i knew beforehand that my parents wouldn t be able easily to accept my first bad grade. i was right. i never got that grade up either. i ended up graduating from th grade with that c, and i had a feeling that things would only get worse from there. i was right. in th grade, i failed two classes biology and geometry. after that, my grades were mainly cs and ds. i only got as in useless classes like pe and extracurriculars. my parents constantly degraded me because i was a thisappointment. since i was not doing good in school, they could not brag about me to our relatives. nothing that happened in our home stayed within our home either, so the concern that i might not graduate high school quickly spread among our relatives. because i did poorly in school, i felt inferior when i was around my family. due to my upbringing, i have always had a fearful avoidant approach to relationships, which means i constantly switch from wanting to be accepted by my parents and wanting them to treat me as if i do not exist. since i can not raise my voice at them or tell them how i feel, i ended up having a lot of internal conflicts and could not cope properly with the things my parents said to me. as a result, i just stopped talking to them. although we lived in the same house, i acted as if they were ghosts that i could not see. my parents can handle yelling but they can not deal with being ignored, and because i could not be honest and tell my parents how i felt during that time that i felt like i did not fit into our family because my ideals were different from theirs, that i believed there were more important things than school and grades all i could do was show my anger through silence. but silence can always be misinterpreted... my lack of reaction to everything around me caused a lot of issues in my family. i even got caught by my parents while i was on shrooms when i was actually, i should not say caught since i told them i was on drugs during a bad trip anxiety attack totally my fault for taking an eighth at once, never happened again . but this happened at a bad time. i did not have many birthday parties growing up, so my parents wanted to hold a sweet birthday party for me. this was merely a performative party for my parents to pretend like our family was not on the verge of breaking. i did not want a party for that exact reason, but it still happened. it was only a month later that i was caught on drugs, and it caused an even bigger rift between my parents and i. they lost all trust in me, but honestly, i lost my trust in them too. i can not remember many of the things i told them when i was tripping out, but i know for a fact i told my parents i felt depressed, and i remember exactly what my mom said in response what do you have to be depressed about? i wish i could have told her, right. you telling me that you wish i was not born is not something that should affect me after all... after this incident, they took off the doorknob on the door for my room, i was not allowed to be alone, and they wouldn t let me sit alone with my sister because they thought i would contaminate her or something. for this reason, i thought being at school was still better than suffocating at home in that tense, judgemental, depressing environment. my father had bouts of explosive anger during my high school years. of course, they were all caused by me. on my th birthday, i came home from school and felt very odd. my dad picked me up but i do not remember what happened during the car ride. once we entered the house, i think he went straight to bed. he worked night shifts and would sleep after picking my sister and me up from school my mom had switched to day shifts a long time ago . i went upstairs to my room. as i looked around, my face felt very hot all of a sudden. most of my things were gone. aside from heavy furniture, my belongings were nowhere to be seen. all i saw was a white letter folded on my desk. it was my progress report for that quarter. all ds. my dad is handwriting was underneath. people tend to forget things that shock them too greatly, so i do not remember exactly what that letter said, but it was something like, you re now. we do not have to take care of you. if you do not graduate high school and go to college, we ll kick you out. i got so angry that i cried. only a few weeks before this, my parents and i had already talked about my future. i told them i wanted to be a tattoo artist and that i wouldn t waste money by going to college. i mentioned that there were people i knew who could help me get started. they had not objected to anything when i told them either. i went on stupidly, believing that they accepted my choices. i thought maybe we had finally reached some kind of understanding. i realized once again that no one in my family cares about what i want. how i feel. my dreams for my future. unfortunately for me, at the end of the day, nothing mattered. i was financially dependent on my parents, and if i wanted to have a roof over my head, i had to live my life how they wanted me to. i started to think that maybe i was fated to always be controlled, and fated to always let myself be controlled. that very evening, on my th birthday, i applied to a community college in my city. my grades were shitty and i did not even know if i would graduate, so that was my only option. my parents did not give any reaction when they found out i had applied, but on my graduation day, their personality changed completely. since my grades were shit, i did not know if i would graduate until two or three weeks before the ceremony after grades were finalized . my senior class had close to , students, and i was ranked or something like that our school had around , students . it is kind of sad but also funny to think that even the people who barely knew me would say things like, nah, you look really smart. you probably have all as, to me whenever i said i was not doing good in class which was my usual response whenever someone asked me to help them with their work . this was another reason why i could never bring myself to ask teachers or classmates for help with my assignments. everyone assumed i did not need it, so i felt like i did not have the right to ask. anyway, as i was saying, my parents completely switched up on me after i graduated. i started college in the summer after graduating. i chose criminal justice as my major but changed it to psychology a year later. for the most part, my parents acted like the past never happened. they were suddenly very bright, very joyful, had no enmity towards me, and even joked about my high school days by the time i was halfway through college i am currently in my rd year . i think that maybe that is the only way they can cope with how they treated me. maybe we re all secretly thinking of the mistakes we made and hating ourselves for it, but i have never been the type that can put on an act, which is why it is difficult for me to try and understand things from my parents point of view. to explain further on the financial dependency part... i did not get my first cellphone until i was . similarly, i did not get braces until i was . i considered both of these things luxuries, and i felt some bitterness towards my parents for not allowing me to have these things at a younger age. but i realized in college that there are more important things in life. the reason my parents did not want to spend a lot of money on things that weren t needed was that they wanted to pay my college tuition in its entirety. if you did not know the salary of an rn and a cls, i will let you know that it is not small. but ultimately, that is not my money, and i have never felt entitled to my parents money. i have never asked my parents for money like allowance or lunch money and usually alternated between the same outfits while i was in high school because i did not want to ask them for things and feel indebted later on. i guess you can say i am very much influenced by the american style of thinking that you should not leech off your parents after a certain age. but my parents mindset is not american at all in that regard. they told me that the reason they work and make money is so my sister and i can have easier lives. because my dad had to go to university in america even after getting a degree in india due to some courses not being transferrable , he knows the difficulty of paying off student loans. he paid his loans off in years because he has a good salary, but usually, it takes people much longer. as some of you know, a lot of students who go to year universities right out of high school end up close to k k in debt but only earn k k with their starting salaries. this makes it very difficult to pay off loans quickly because living expenses in america, especially southern california where we live , can be quite expensive. so, as you can probably tell, when i think about what my parents are doing for me in this regard making my life easier by eliminating the possibility of me having debt in the future , i really hate myself for not being able to overlook the issues we had in the past. i can not bring myself to forget how my parents used to treat me, nor can i joke about that time. for me, those years were full of repressed pain. i could not even tell my friends what went on in my house back then. yet, i also have a strong desire to succeed in life and make a lot of money so that i can give my parents back everything they have given me. in a sense, i want to eliminate the indebted feeling i have towards them, and eventually cut all ties with them. as i mentioned before, i have always been a fearful avoidant person. i want love, but i also want to be forgotten. i want to be acknowledged by my parents, but at the same time, i want to end our relationship as soon as i fulfill my filial duties. my father had quit drinking many years ago and became a better man. i no longer have anything to hate him for, but at the same time, i have many unresolved negative feelings towards him that have carried on from my childhood. and, as you can probably tell, no matter how much i hate d my parents in my heart, those words never left my lips. i never told my parents i hated them during the moments where i felt the truth of those words down to my core. similarly, i have never once told my parents that i love them. there were moments in my adulthood where i felt especially attached to my parents. just the thought of them leaving me or passing away made me tear up. but there was always a wall between us. i wanted them to love me, yet i did not want to tell them i loved them. i hated them, but i did not want them to hate me. i wanted to be close with them, where we could settle everything from the past and build a new relationship altogether, but i would always create space between us when i felt we got too close. i got so used to being misunderstood and mistreated that now i feel like it is unnatural and also impossible for us to have a healthy bond. i am almost now. i keep thinking about my parents and what they think of me. they treated me like shit when they thought i would amount to nothing, but as soon as i was attending college and university, they treated me as if i was precious. i felt like i was like an accessory for my parents something to show off, something to be proud of, and ultimately, something that would change other people is opinions about them. if i was a failure, that would make them look bad. if i was successful, it would prove their competence as parents. i do

colorado i finally visited colorado to map out the next steps of my life. i am staying in a dorm with a friend of mine that i have known for years via instagram and finally got to meet her in real life after like six years of video chats and phone calls. i would be lying if i said i was not in love with this girl. i mean she is everything i expected, and then some. she is energetic, very smart, beautiful, and we know each other very well. she is also taken by somebody a lot smarter than me that lives a lot closer to her. i know that if i tried to make a move at this point, it wouldn t be wise. my spiritual beliefs are what is keeping me secure. i believe in reincarnation, and therefore if i took her from this guy or attempted , i would simply be depriving myself in another life. it is shitty karma. she is been letting me sleep in her bed with her not sexually we do not cuddle or make physical contact really of any kind and honestly it is enough. this girl makes me want to see the next day, every day. i did not actually think i would ever be able to meet her. it is almost like pandora is box, now. i have found something in this life that is not only worth staying alive for but worth waiting for. she is told me her and her boyfriend do not see eye to eye on a lot of things long term. i am not here to get in the way of her or their relationship. i just want to enjoy this time i have with her because it is only days until i go back to alabama. i am not supposed to see her again until the summer. she wants to come see alabama and visit my home. and then i am supposed to move up here eventually and i would be lying if i said it was not for this girl. to her knowledge, i am up here to look at colleges. maybe this is really cringe but this has been the most bittersweet time i have ever had in my life and all i can do is be polite and try to have fun while i deal with all of my own nonsense. it has helped my depression though. it is given me a little more hope and more will to live. i just hope i do not fuck up.	not depression

would a therapist accept me, or am i overthinking? ummm well maybe i am just in a bad mood right now but this mood comes up a few times a month so i guess i will share. hobbies are good for nothing more than killing time. as a teenager i loved creative writing but now when i do it it is more out of habit than any love, passion, or enjoyment. i do not really understand people who look forward to things i used to! but, well... i genuinely believe life is no more meaningful than just killing time and busying yourself until you get to die. i do laugh and have love a lot. i genuinely do not believe i am depressed. i function well, wake up consistently, study hard and get good grades. not much of a choice on that front, but i know depression is crippling when it comes to things like that. i guess i am just looking for advice on how to find enjoyment or passion in... well, anything? i consider my view on life a little nihilistic even though i am regularly and known to be goofy, loud, and outspoken. even the shows and books and stuff that i think i love do not really trigger much emotion in me. happy or sad. i feel like any reaction i have to my friends like godi amso sad about chapter is habit. tldr i dont really feel much enjoyment, purpose, or strong emotions at all, but i function well and am a goofy person. is there a chance i could get medical help for this despite not being depressed?	not depression
seriously contemplating suicide ive had sever anxiety, and depression for the past or so years, and this just pushed me over the edge. i moved back into my moms house about a year ago. since then her cat has fallen i will, so i have been paying the the cats vet bill s. shes going to end up needing a surgery that will cost k in a town hours away. my moms house needs around k of repairs done or else we are risking out health living in mold. i dont give shits about my health but i want my mom, and her pest to be healthy. she can not afford any of this so i am obligated to pay for all of it. i personally saved k, and i have about k in my trust fund, and another k in a little while because my brother will be buying out my half of the house. i would just use that money to pay for repairs, and such, but my dad, and mom dont get along, so my dad would be livid if i used my trust fund on my mother is house. i know my grand parents wouldnt be happy iether. i know i am probably being a little bitch, but i just needed to vent about this.	moderate
being single makes everything worse... my whole life i have been alone. i have been with handful of women here and there but never anything even remotely serious. as i grow older i am all my friends are settled down with someone. married, kids, engaged, long relationships. i have always been single. and the sad part is, i do not know what i do wrong. i am a good man, passionate about my goals, caring for others, funny, good looking, and social. but i have suffered greatly from ocd and depression and even with my wall up, people seem to look at me as insecure or weak my only justification . it is almost as if all the good qualities of mine go away. the cycle goes that women are attracted to me when they meet me, but as the weeks go on they get unattracted and put me as their friend. over years you have enough of feeling like you re not good enough. tired of seeing your friends scoring dates and one night stands. tired of the random dude at the bar picking up the woman you like. i decided to not even try anymore but it still hurts that everyone i know looks at me as the always single and alone guy. people even bring it up to me. it really hurts me deep down	severe

social media sucks. modern world sucks. i think that is pretty fucking obvious. the internet has ruined everything. you re always subconsciously comparing yourself to everyone else online, it is hard to accept the fact that you re not the best looking, most skilled or the most talented person out there. play guitar or cover song? someone has already done it and x better than you. have a new idea? someone is already done it! think you look nice today? you re not as attractive as of the people you see. simply impossible to compete or to even be noticed, much less appreciated. because of this your self esteem is just raped but go to take a break from social media and all you re doing is isolating yourself. everyone is so connected it is like we have all forgotten how to socialise in real life, at least i have i think. people would much rather text and stay home than to go out and play. it is like a super internet culture has completely overridden all local cultures and communities. there is nothing unique about an individual is background anymore. we all act the same now on the internet that has us connected globally. nobody seems to hold any inherent traditions or values. and all this fucking virtue signalling, why can not you fake bastards fucking stop? legit nobody fucking cares how virtuous you are, how altruistic you are, you re only making anti racist, anti homophobic posts to fuel your own narcissistic egos. idk what i am saying, go to hell	not depression

what do i even do? i am starting to really think i have depression or anxiety, or maybe depression caused by anxiety, or even vice versa. however, i have no one to talk to about it. even my own mother probably wouldn t believe me, after all, if i express feeling even the slightest bit sick or down, or i get upset at all, the first thing she does is ask me if it is my time of the month because of course i can only possibly have negative emotions when i am one my period. any other time is impossible. i was literally complaining of a sore throat, difficultly breathing, and a fever and she said i could not stay home from school because it was just symptoms. but i am at least sure it is fucking not. i literally have the worst immune system of all the people i know! anytime any sickness is even mentioned of spreading around my area, i already have it. if she does not even believe me when i am physically sick, how on this god forsaken earth would she believe me when i am mentally sick?	not depression
i stay up all night, as if that will stop the next day from coming the actual act of going to bed is something i dread in very dulled kind of way. like that interval when you re lying in bed, the lights off, and you re trying desperately to sleep which is a bit of contradiction in itself that is one of my least favourite moments of human experience. for me that is when the really horrible thoughts come from all sides, and time goes agonisingly slowly, and i am just there tossing and turning, trying and failing to sleep for what feels like eternity, and it sucks big time. i very much thislike that shit. so what i do is and it is not really a conscious decision, like it is just what happens, or what i let happen is i stay up. late. real late. to the point where it becomes early. on one level to avoid that moment, so that i will be so exhausted that i just drop, on another, so that i do not have to face the next day with all its inevitable tedium a delusion . i whittle away the hours by thistracting myself in various ways, like reading, writing, watching things, music, scrolling through reddit, scrolling mindlessly without actually looking at the posts, etc. anything to not be alone with myself. anyone else have similar experience? maybe have some tips? i know i have a surrender problem, i can not let go or be still, and that i should start meditating as a regular practice, and that i need to start being with myself more and communicating with myself more, like starting a journal or something. and get back into regular exercise. and cut down on screen time. but idk, whenever i start doing these things, they quite quickly drop off. it is hard to make changes when you have felt shitty for so long, when you re more comfortable with feeling shitty than working to get better. the devil you know.	moderate

i think i have depression but i am scared that i am just giving self pity. all i feel nowadays is pain, extreme sadness or nothingness. i am not sure if what i am having are mental breakdowns i might be overreacting. sometimes i cry myself to sleep thinking about all the negatives in my life. to counter that i tried coming up with a list of the things that give me pleasure in my life i am not going to specify what is on there but it is very small. furthermore, my parents are strict in my home, shouting all the time and telling me i need to work and improve my grades. whenever i am not working, i am literally finding any form of luxury to do before i am asked to do something again. i can never fully relax at home. whenever i am being shouted at, i can not talk back to my parents otherwise i am treated as the brattiest kid they have witnessed. this has caused me to become extremely introverted, shy and has given me a you re better of just shutting up mindset which brings me on to school. i have made multiple friends in my school, unintentionally. i am very quiet and do not really feel comfortable around them? i get a really bad feeling mentally around them as if they are all out to get me. i feel as if i am just an inconvenience when i am around many i go silent, sweat quite a bit and will eventually just drift away from the group. i assume that is just what the life of a general introvert is like. i can not speak to anyone since i do not trust anyone, i feel like i do not exist around the majority people in my life. i feel like my life is just hard work, no joy, pain and suffering. i feel like my friends are fake. i feel like my parents do not honestly think about how i feel or even care. i feel demotivated. i feel constantly tired. just thought i would vent here. i repeat, i may be exaggerating the problems of my life but i need others views on this. do i have depression? i can not really speak to anyone about this since i am seen as one of the happiest people in others eyes, my parents are strong christians and so i do not believe they will understand how i can possibly feel this way, as if they raised me wrong. sorry if this all seems quite sloppily written, i am just venting. what are your takes?	moderate

is it normal for suicidal urges to get worse before going to work? just a question. is it normal to want to die before going to work? i do not like my job at all. i do not enjoy it or get any sense of satisfaction from it. i have to travel frequently for my job. i absolutely hate it. do not get me wrong, i enjoy traveling just not what my job entails while traveling. every time i have to travel for my job, i need almost a week in advance to come to terms with it. it is just long hours and being forced to socialize even on off hours. it makes me more depressed than i already am. to make myself feel better about having to travel, i always tell myself that i will die before we have to go. that is the only thing that makes me feel better about going. my suicidal urges are strongest at that point. i have not actually done anything though. i am sure that this is pretty common for other people too	moderate

i can not hide from myself it comes and goes with the seasons so i at least get a little taste of reality before becoming lost in my mind again. i have matured and my beliefs have changed but depression is emotional and so it is hard to rationalize with. i used to be sad that i havent had sex andi am now. but honestly its not a big deal, at least not to me and if someone else decides otherwise, fuck them its my life. my depression isnt really based on thought processes as much anymore its just a deep feeling of loneliness. it drove me to a massive drug binge with lots of acid every week for about a year and a half, then a short but intense benzo binge. acid probably taught me a lot that i take for granted, but i know it taught me one thing, i can not answer these questions with anything that quick. it will always be a slow, painful and confusing process with some beautiful moments. the benzos stop me from feeling for months. i dont remember a lot of it. during my first semester of college i was almost entirely unconscious. i was effectively the living dead. and then i almost died for good. my friend told me my heart had stopped briefly. but came back as the drugs wore off in time for me to survive. since then i can not explain it but ive changed drastically, in some good ways in some bad. i feel as though i did die and this is the new life i am living. and i often have a sensation that a part of me is still in the other world , again hard to explain. but to be frank i saw nothing, just a peaceful unconsciousness. but if theres one thing ive learned, its that no tiny brained human such as me could ever truly understand the nature of life and death, soi amgoing to stop right their and let mystery be mystery. the depression is coming back even though i am different now. its become blatantly obvious to me that these things ive felt for so long can not be solved with things on the outside. not even the embrace of a lover. i have spent so much time chasing a dream because reality was never enough. in the end i can not hide from myself or my nature, for it is what shapes my existence. and as far as i can tell death is the ultimate darkness. for that reason i no longer believe death is better than life. and ive realized its better to experience pain than nothing. you dont get what you want. and you dont know what you need until you have found it. i hope i find that one day.	moderate

i think that is me done. on march th of last year, i m tried to od and i failed, after the event happened i said to my self i will give it a year and if nothing gets better i would do it again except this time i will succeed. well it is coming up to that time and my life has actually gotten worse. i can not go on anymore, people say you should talk to someone and i have done that but to be quite honest, i am sick of talking, i just can not take anymore of life. today i accepted that on march th, ill be ending my life. the reason i am posting this is because if any one is thinking of ending their life, give yourself at least a year to get better, i know i had my chances during that year but i did not take any of them, in fact i made them worse. advice from a dead man? do not make the same mistakes i made.	moderate

i am demolishing myself for the past years ive been isolating myself and separated myself from everybody. it started when i began smoking weed, i just quit a month or two ago and now that i have exited this year delusional daze that ive been in, i am a social wreck. i lost all my friends despite trying to reconnect with them, i just feel so slow like i can not keep up with conversations with them like i used to years ago. i feel boring and like i have nothing to offer and extremely trapped. i will go weeks without talking to anybody andi ameven awkward around my family, the persistent sadness and emptiness i feel from losing everybody around me mixed with an uncertainty for the future leaves me feeling so socially debilitated that i could just stand there in a daze while someone tries to talk to me, and i really dont know what to do at all. i feel like i can not turn to anybody bbecause there is no one left to turn to, and i hate being a depressing burden. time has just changed me so much that i feel like i had more to offer when i was than i do now at going on and that is a horrible feeling, because i feel like ive lost a part of myself and fucked up my family dynamic bbecause of it.	severe

feelings of depression and guilt exacerbated by pandemic feeling guilty about feelings during pandemic...? i am in ontario, canada, so currently we are not under any lockdown or anything that extensive. however, it seems like we are heading in that direction. i have really poorly managed anxiety, we have been playing with my meds for months now. almost a year ago i had a pretty serious suicide attempt, and it is been a waiting game since then to try and get me back on track due to the lack of access to the appropriate medical services. anyways, i feel guilty for becoming suicidal during the pandemic. there is so much else happening everywhere there is no cases in my town , that i feel bad for even considering killing myself but that guilt is what is driving me to the edge. i feel like it is only a matter of time before i snap. i live alone and i am terrified that if they quarantine us i would not be able to see my caseworker or my therapist. i have been seeing someone twice a week most weeks because i can not make it more than a few days without going into extreme thistress. it does not help that i am coming out of a manic episode. i am terrified of being locked in my apartment alone, and i am scared that i do not know what is happening. i do not even care about the virus. if i get it, i am a high risk, so it might be bad. but we do not have any cases here. i am more worried about the actions of other people. i have severe gastroparesis and i am just so done with living a this point because i am in such a horrible flare. i can not eat anything. the things i can eat everyone is emptying the shelves of panic buying soup and rice...etc . i do not know what to do. ifeel like i can not go to the hospital to reach out for help and support when i am in crisis, but i also can not keep doing this. my classes got cancelled and i am thinking that i will be out a job next week most likely based on how things are going right now as well...please help i do not know what to do, i know deep down i want to live and that is why i am reaching out but right now i am losing all of my reasons. i have been staying in bed all day everyday and that is usually one of the final signs for me.	moderate

finally taking time off of work to sort myself out the last months have been a series of ups and downs, from my past experience i know that i can go from happy as ever into a spiral in a matter of days. this time it is happened gradually, i have taken so much time off work in the last months and just in the last two weeks i have taken days off where i have come in, cried and got sent home. i feel guilty for leaving my team short but i am not doing anything whilst i am at work just mindlessly staring at my screen trying to avoid others and not to cry. finally sent an email to my manager to say that i need more substantial amount of time off, i can not keep taking a day off here and there because it is not helping. i feel so bad for leaving my team short but i am not in a good place mentally. i work as a nurse with people with mental health conditions yet i am sitting here crying every day and self harming, i am unable to put into practice the own advice i give yet i am expected to help others with the same. i just can not deal with it anymore 	moderate
i f am a crying babbling mess. life does not seem to be getting any better. this time last year my f life was so different. although i was lbs heavier than i am now amp really anxious about my job, i was doing well there in my career, made good money, was headed on vacation to the beach, in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who i thought liked me. fast forward to now i was fired from that job, then i got another job which i was laid off from in december because they got rid of my whole department still looking for work , still have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and was not shy about it and had no ulterior motives, and i am beyond sad and cry every day. i am crying writing this. i want to feel better, to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that i go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by, but i can not. it frustrates me and i feel so dumb. dating it has been so awful for me. i know that having a partner would not bring me the happiness i need on my own, i need to focus on myself, my time will come, but i hate hate hate hearing that shit. i have been focusing on myself for the last . years, and i think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with. and i also hate when someone says but you re so pretty smart and kind and alluring, you ll find someone! you do not know that!!!!!! i have been noticeably different towards my friends. i decided to open up to one of them and now that i have, i really wish i had just gone with the i am fine response. she is trying to help and i know that i am difficult to even have a conversation with right now. she said if i needed thistance then she would give it, but it feels selfish to do that, so i continue to say it is fine to continue talking. but it hurts to hear about hers or the other people in my life increase in pay at her job, her new guy she is seeing, how her life is going so well, when mine is utter and complete shit. and all i can do is compare and it leads to more crying. she says she wants to help me get out of the funk i am in and that i have every right to feel how i feel but i need to be more positive. i love her and thank her for want to help, but i hate hearing that. which then leads me back to thinking maybe i should just thistance myself. we have argued a bit lately. and i know it is because of me. i have become too attached we talk throughout the day, every day amp i get more anxious when i do not hear from her. i tried being vulnerable this afternoon and i still have not heard from her. but i am resisting sending another text. i absolutely hate how much things like this i s affect my happiness. i wish i was not such a shit person and friend. people always suggest gym and eating better as ways to cope. well the thing is is that i already go to the gym times a week sometimes daily . there around min to hours. during that time is the only time i am confident, happy, and determined in myself. i feel strong, capable, and on top of the world. but as soon as i leave, it is back to shit. but if i did not have the gym, i do not know how even darker and more depressed i would feel. also i live at home with my parents and sister right now i have not eaten more than one small meal a day really in the past days. i have been able to hide it from them. not that i am trying to starve myself, but when i get really sad nowadays it i think i thisappoint my friend or my family, i do not eat. due to not working and not really having money, i do not go anywhere. which leads to minimal social interaction. i did not realize that it would affect me so much. but it really has. on the off chance i talk to someone at the gym, that makes my week because that is usually the only interaction i get. i go to my favorite local bar every so often and it helps just to be somewhere different. but i feel guilty spending a little money on two drinks and to socialize. i do the the things that they say most people who are depressed usually do not do i clean, make meals for myself, shower daily, go to the gym. so then i think to myself, maybe i am not depressed? maybe i am making this up and it is not legitimate. and job i have applied, but honestly i have been hesitant to apply to a lot of jobs because i just do not feel smart enough or capable enough at all. i have colleagues in my field who say i am young, smart and capable. but it does not feel that way given my recent job history. how are you? my honest answer for the last months i am tired i am lonely and i am stupid and i hate myself.	not depression

i just realized why i do poorly in school moments ago i am currently a sophomore in high school and have generally always had bare minimum poor grades. for years my parents wrote it off as laziness because i seemed to do well on tests usually a is without studying . last year i was diagnosed with adhd, which would explain past problems with school so i started taking meds. this school year is the first i have taken my meds and am still barely scraping by in college prep classes, but tonight i had an epiphany as to my problem. i have always had a caring and supportive group of friends that have always been in honors classes, they all were nice, except for one. this kid let us call him joe has always been a consistent asshole by turning jokes against me, my friends against me, and of course ridiculing me for being in lower classes. it is unfortunately unavoidable since we hang out with the same people so i tryyy to be nice to him...as much as possible anyways. sorry for the rant but tl dr i think this asshole caused me to have depression btw there is also other things atop all this that does not help but far too many to list	severe

some changes bare with me here. negative talk incoming. so i am finally a part of a friend group. one of seven people...and the six others are paired together in three relationships so i am the only single one. sucks to suck i guess lol it is always something that makes me feel left out. i have never been in a relationship while they have all had their history of them. plus they have all known each other for far longer so they have deeper connections with each other than i will ever have with them. that just makes me overthink that they might talk about me behind my back that definitely is not unfamiliar territory. i do not know. i can not really see myself ever trusting people as much as i used to i always get let down or left behind. maybe i will just let myself be left behind this time if things hint towards an unfortunate tapering off from those good feelings. i would not be surprised if i am ousted from the group within the next few months so i guess i will just enjoy the little things while i can.	moderate

i have begun to give up hope on doing anything well. i literally can not do anything right anymore, can not do anything well. is just going to be a reminder of how much time i have wasted. maybe this is not right to throw my thoughts out, but i just need to vent i think. with the new year of here, i honestly feel that i should be something more than i was excluding wisdom gained from aging. growing up i was a huge gamer and i love games always have. i have also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. then comes , i just lose my ability to do everything. the people around me say that what i do is good, but that just is not true. they are just being nice and can not see that the numbers just do not add up. i cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when i took a bite i honestly felt like breaking down just a little. it was so god awful that i told them i refuse to eat it. i got up and walked away. did not eat dinner that night. i just want to feel good at something. anything. the one thing i thought, i had some sort of skill. some sort of worth, was in games. i grew up with it, played years worth. so why do i suck so damn badly? moba is i just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. fps is people constantly ask if i am intentionally deranking. mmo is i can not even do the end game content because i just do not have the items to do it, and i refuse to pay to win. i usually do not let the negativity get to me, but now i just feel so fricken worthless. i can not do anything. not even interact with people like i used to. i lost practically everyone i used to know, and they moved on. everyone does eventually. i do not know if i am depressed but, i feel like my worth is zero to none at this point. i told myself for the longest time, is going to be my year, my strongest year yet, i am a day in and i already feel like giving up. pathetic right.	moderate

i just started to write a suicide note. might be worth a read now, first i want to clarify, that i have no intention of going through with anything. i have been super severely depressed, for a long time now. around years. that is around the time i got out of jail, had my own place, good job, a good group of good friends. i might want to add that prior to going to jail i was in a relationship that destroyed me completly and had i had the means to do so, would have taken my life anyways, life was really great. and then i started using heroin. i am soon. i was, at the time. anyways, things went downhill really quickly as i overdosed not long after getting into it. did that for a couple months, like or , and i got a wake up call super long story, there is so many things i will have to leave out of this post so i can save some time but, i ended quitting cold turkey. and shortly after went on a week binge, ended up crashing my car almost killing myself and my friends. i blacked out behind the wheel fast forward a little, years ago, from present day, i met a girl. and we had a vibe like i have never vibed with a girl before. it ended up being a mistake. and pretty much ever since then, i find little to no enjoyment in my life. i hate myself. everything i have done, people, and family i have hurt. there is so much regret and guilt, pain and sorrow. everything is become stagnant. and i do not think i can ever get out of the rut that i am in. i barely go outside, or go anywhere really. i do not talk to people much, and i barely see my friends or family anymore. i just stopped leaving my house i feel thisconnected from this world. from all of the people. the only reason i am still around is because i know what it would do to my family if i were to take my own life. because the thought of that brings me enough pain, that the pain that makes me want to die becomes irrelevant. starting to write a suicide note, was a decision i made in order to vent. but, to actually dig into everything that is deep inside. everything i have buried over the years. all the secrets. everything. i got quite a lot of it written actually. and it felt good to release all of what i held inside. i think that was the first time i have actually cried since before going to jail, years ago. in the note, i came to realizations, about myself, and my life. my place in my life. the places that i do belong. i was scrolling through this subreddit and to see everyone, all the people that have alot of the same feelings as me, it makes me so sad. i wish i could help all of you, i hope this post helps alot of you. here is something i wrote in my note maybe i am just stuck in a loop. searching for answers i will never find, to questions i will never know. obviously this is a paradox. but i feel like it describes so much. to me, it is like a state of nothingness. a place where even i do not exist. and i just want to say, to whoever might be reading this. please, do not hurt yourself. i understand the pain, the suffering. having nothing left. all of it. i get it. but, stay alive. stay alive for you. even if you feel like you re not even worth that. do it harder. for the past you s. and the future you. always here if you need someone to lend an ear. thank you for reading.	moderate

it is like teachers got worse after being told i have anxiety and depression this is a bit of a post to get rid of my anger i talked to my school guidanc councilor and she told the principal that i was going to therapy for depression and anxiety. she told teachers to consider that when giving out to me for certain things. like i get really tired because of my mental illness so i get snappy at teachers when they annoy me so they basically give me more of a chance or something. so i have cbas classroom based assessment they are basically small projects that go towards your junior certificate andi amreally stressing over them because they give some percentage of my tests. so i was working on my computer turned off. i went to the teacher kinda panicked because i had days to finish i am finished now d and i needed computer to work i told him this and he sat me in a corner of the room and gave me paper and told me to work on i could not so just doodled on the paper and got lunch time detention. this was maths. then in english i was sleeping after finishing my work. this teacher is usually really understanding. he came up to me slapped the table next to me and said if you want to sleep get out of my god damn class lemme see your work. showed him the work he told me it was about what he expected from a year old. i re write it he says it is terrible and that i need to do it for homework. next day i did more than he wanted me to do word essay expected and i done he says he could not read the writing and that i need to do it again i refused got kicked out of class had to go to the principal and she said i should work to his standards. a few other things happened but these are the worst.	moderate

i have been invalidated my whole life and i have no one. my whole life, from childhood to now at , with parents, teachers, friends, coworkers, boyfriends, i was always told i am overreacting, calm down, it is not that big of a deal, oh yeah? well i had it much worse, be grateful you did not have what i have to deal with, just wait until , people wouldn t do x if you would just y, they did not mean it, it is your fault, if you would have just x then they wouldn t y, let it go, do not let it bother you so much, it is ok for you to be abused because they , get over it it was a long time ago, why are you bringing this up?, everyone deals with that, i had it much worse than you, how dare you complain when you have it so much better than others, that is just the way it is, they are like that to everybody, just deal with it, just suck it up. shut up, be quiet, stop causing trouble. my whole life, i would reach out to someone, anyone, from guidance counselors and teachers and parents and friends and boyfriends and time and time again i would be invalidated and told to shut up and sit in the corner and that my feelings do not matter. my therapist is the first person to tell me my feelings matter and notice that every time i cried for help, i would be ignored. i literally have no one else but myself and my therapist who is getting too expensive, and i hate myself, so i have no one. how can i stand up for myself when i hate myself? i crumble when it comes to confrontation and people just walk all over me and invalidate me.	severe
i am done in a few months or so years of depression whilst having the perfect life i could ever ask for. well, not perfect but great. i am loved and have a great support system. i am taking meds and nothing is working. i do not think this life is for me. i feel like i am living in someone else is body because it seems like happiness is around me but it is like reaching for the sun. i will never get it. at this point, i am just taking up space. i am just making sure my dog will be well taken care of and going to start going through my stuff to see who would find it useful. i will be graduating engineering this may so i guess might as well finish it since i suffered in that major enough. but after that, i do not know how i am going to do it. i have different scenarios in my head but no concrete plans. i hope you all of you guys find happiness. you deserve it. love you all.	moderate

this had just started i have met this one friend of my he would not see this so ill call him by his real name christian, back in november of . we have been good friends, until he starts talking about this one girl he has been talking to she would not see this so ill call her by her real name sage and i think of the name and it seem familiar but i do not really think about that much and i have seen her before bet he tell me so much about him and her like how they have madeout and how have they had the threesome with a mutual friend named gabe. then i went over to his house early in the morning note they weren t dating, but sage and christian both call sage his main hoe and she also comes over but he did not tell me she was coming over. i then realized i have known her since third grade she just had blond hair and a gap in her teeth with at the time i thought was cute and she still has her speech impediment which i think is cute also. she then remembers me, and i asked christian if they we re dating and he said no, i then asked if he cared if i flirted with her, he said no again. i start to flirt and she flirted back. after some talking we started to talk and he watched us make out which was really weird. christian, sage,christian is sister karli, and i went to the local park and just messed around because no one was there me and sage were talking and hanging around and i guess christian got mad so he wanted to talk to karli, so karli told sage and me to go to the baseball dugout and when we did we looked around and played tic tac toe on the wall and then i picked her up mind you i am and she is around ish and have her put her legs around my waist and i pinned her against a wall and we made out for a while. then karli called us over right before i was going to ask sage out then christian pulled sage aside and asked her out before i could. she said yes too. after walking around some more i went home and cut my self on my right wrist. it felt heart breaking anytime i saw them together but i knew who she was, she did not care if she was in a relationship or not if you do not give her dick she will find someone to give her dick... christian had to go home early and sage had to get something from dollar general so i went with her. i went home with her and another friend and we went through her camera roll and watched pet cemetery but when the friend left her cat got on my legs when they were crossed and let us say she missed petting the cat on purpose and i pet her pussy on purpose too. a week or two later she calls him later and he breaks up with him and i am not at all the extrovert type so it took a week to even ask her out but she changed the subject by saying i am going to a fuck buddy is house later. so i felt great after that and we really never talked since and now we re here and i still have suicidal thoughts and want to cut myself daily buti amtrying not too but i know one day i will not be able to stop it. tl dr my friend tells me about this girl. i hit it off with her her starts to date her she cheats on him with me she calls him a cheater they break up i ask her out she changes the subject and she stops talking to me.	moderate
depression amp spiraling thoughts a little about me...i am a year old female. i used to be a gym rat, working out days a week, taught a class even, i am a musician, an insurance broker, crazy cat lady and love cleaning...december i made the decision to leave my husband of years because we simply weren t seeing eye to eye anymore. i started dating someone very shortly after that. i moved into my own place, traded in my car, and then started to get into some financial trouble. balancing these things all hit me at once. i stopped going to the gym, could not even imagine playing my guitar or my piano, the sight of a thish in the sink would throw me into a panic attack... i have to wash two plates and fold clothes, omg, how . ..... my dad, over the course of a year, has given me a total of dollars k to pay off debts and just generally pay bills dollars k last summer and k recently . out of nowhere, i spiraled into a depression. i have had some pretty bad anxiety for awhile, but as soon as he gave me that second loan, i spiraled out of control with guilt, which quickly turned into a severe depression anxiety. i have already gone through my weeks of pto and more . i can not go to work because i feel like i have the flu all the time, and now i am scared of being able to able to pay back the loan, make rent, etc. every day of work i missed just made me feel worse, but the thought of going made me crazy. what is happening to me? everyone is mad at me, i am such a thisappointment . every day is a struggle for me. i love my boyfriend, but i feel like my depression is pushing him away, my co workers are mad at me, and you sure learn quick who your real friends are during a major life change. i have lost several friends over the past year, and obviously my ex in laws are all upset with me understandable since i was the initiator of the divorce. i also had to leave two cats behind which were my world sounds silly, but they were . basically, the guilt just eats away at me. i am one of those people that can not stand the thought of people being mad at me or not like me. i can not just brush it off or say screw it. i care too much what people think. people that do not even matter to me or have no significance in my life. i think way too hard into the future, and worry about everything that has not even happened yet. it is like i am trying to control, and protect my future self from getting hurt somehow but i do not even know what those things are. so much so that this why i have been missing work because i was so anxious and depressed that i could not fathom eating, which was making me sick...i can not go to work, can not pay my bills, will get kicked out of my place, my boyfriend will move on, will lose my car, will have to move back in with my parents, and be lonely, sick and sad forever. i will just be known as that sick girl . this is the way my mind spirals out of control on a daily basis. i have seen a psychiatrist, a therapist, had multiple visits with my doctor, so now the doctors bills are going to start piling on top of it. currently i am taking mg of zoloft, which has been beneficial to me in the past roughly , but i stupidly decided to ween myself off of it around the same time i started going through a divorce. like i wanted to prove to myself i could handle all of this on my own without the use of medications. wrong. i was also taking around mg of ambien every night for sleep and it worked great for me. i had no side effects whatsoever. however, i started to run out way to early. i was sleeping a lot and napping so i would break them into pieces to take naps. the doctor became alerted to this during our last visit and refused to refill it for me, which of course, sent me into a literal tailspin and severe panic. i was throwing up when i left the office because i was so thistraught and still had not eaten . my mind went reeling thinking how am i going to function and handle all of this stress if i can not ever sleep, how can i work? literally thinking i would die eventually from exhaustion and depression. my psychiatrist then prescribed me mg of remeron, which seems to have been working ok but it is just not the same. i hate starting new medications. i went through all the classic symptoms, sadness, anger, etc. my parents, boyfriend is parents, my siblings, boyfriend, all started to become worried and concerned for me which made me feel worse. i just feel like i am going to run out of time as i keep saying. basically, that everyone around me is going to abandon me before i have a chance to heal. this week, i am back at work and have been sleeping somewhat better and doing my best to stay positive and just focus on work, pushing past the feelings and just trying to enjoy my life day by day instead of trying to fix everything. of course, my mind is still reeling and i am still not feeling great, but taking baby steps. does anyone relate to any of this? thanks	severe

how to cope after decades of depression and no viable hope for the future? hello! i feel a bit of background story is in order. i have been with depression and gad since i was about i turn this year . sometimes it gets a little better, sometimes it gets a little worse. except now it is a lot worse. not the worst, but heading there. i can not seem to cope these days, thoughts of ending it all are frequent, no matter how much i talk to my therapist i do talk therapy and have medications , no matter how much i read self help articles, i take my pills as prescribed, nothing is helping. my therapist says that not having enough money is a major trigger for me, which is true, since i grew up poor and am now struggling to make ends meet. does anyone have any advice on how to pick myself up when everything around me is broken or sellotaped together? nothing works and i have no money to fix it... i am not a materialistic person, i just think i have hit my limit at how much i can take... for a bit more background i f, live in a studio apartment that my grandmother left me, it is legally mine, so i do not pay rent, only property taxes twice a year. i am unemployed and looking for a job for about a year now, but nobody wants to hire me. i live off of what i make by backing cakes for people and babysitting for neighbours. i am not poor, but i think the situation of not seeing a way out of this day to day living is getting to me. i feel so worthless and helpless, pathetic and sad... i am willing to work, i promise, only nobody wants to hire me... i apologise if something does not make much sense, i feel jumbled and english is not my first language. not an excuse, but just know it is not intentional. thank you to all in advance, xx	severe
do these count as suicidal feelings and should i bring them up to my doctor? trigger warning do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question how often do you feel suicidal have thoughts of harming yourself? because in my depression i have definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. i do not feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. but even in my darkest moments, i never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when i really wanted to die and i trust myself that i am never going to act on any feelings in this area i may have and that if i was afraid i was going to that i would seek emergency care. going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. . situation current situation, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if i am low. random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let us say i am feeling depressed sometimes these happen when i am not thistinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood i suppose and i am washing a kitchen knife. my brain goes, you could use that to kill yourself. the rational part of my brain steps in and is like, no, you re not going to do that. that is stupid. . situation current situation, happens as often as situation . the same as situation except that the feelings are not randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. example my favorite person reads but does not reply to my text. this causes a mental breakdown where i am incredibly anxious, i am convinced they hate me, and i am also convinced i am the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. my brain goes okay, guess you should just kill yourself then. but the rational part is like no you do not. that is stupid. sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between situation and situation . . situation current situation, happens probably once a week? i am having a mood dip. i am feeling intensely depressed. i find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. i do not have any plan for suicide. i do not have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. despite the fact that emotionally, i think i want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that i do not want to actually die. if someone were to come up to me and tell me that within minutes i was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, i would be devastated because i do not actually want to die. i really want to live and feel better and i have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. the rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that i only think i want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. again, i do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and i do not actually want to die. i also trust that if i did want to actually kill myself that i would reach out to someone or call because again, deep down i do not want to die and i want to live. . situation past situation. this has happened in the past but very rarely now. example grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take one for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. example not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because i was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. in both situations, i had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. which of those count as thoughts of suicide or whatever my doctor might ask? if i bring these things up to my doctor and explain i experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that i am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that i do not want to die, am i in any danger of getting hospitalized? should i make the above things sound like i do not experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say? chances are i wouldn t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so i could honestly say no if asked if i was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually do not last terribly long for me. i live in florida in case that matters. thank you so much!	severe
something beautiful i found in youtube comments i know, right and just wanted to share it with you guys here it goes the most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways except towards themselves. always remember this. when you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, do not take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early. just pull them aside and let them know it is alright and that we are all lost here. that is all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that does not matter, and truly connect with them even if just for a second to have a human moment. even subtle eye contact can do it. just do not let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. because they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world. depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds for to them, they are alone. cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can not connect even for a second. and all they want is to be loved. to legitimately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. they need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves. they have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. they realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. to them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. but without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet still feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a tv show and a bowl of ice cream. i just thought i can brighten up someone is day as it did mine, be strong yall.	not depression

day what is the point of still being alive. a letter to my dad. you told me to be honest with you, and i tried to be, but all that did was make you thisappointed and upset that i was not turning out the way you wanted. when i was honest about my flaws, instead of supporting me, all you did was feel thisappointed and dug the knife in deeper, every time. you get angry when i close myself off, and you are upset when i open up. i can not help feeling afraid, i am not as perfect and as achieving as you are. believe me, i wish i was, and i can already tell that despite all the effort i put in to have an honest thiscussion with you some days ago when you were upset and angry, you did not hear a single thing i said. and you obviously do not remember any of it. your mind somehow can not comprehend anything about me, any of my flaws, the way my mind works, or literally anything about how people work except from your own perspective. how dare you tell me that your life has been awful and that you have suffered. i know you have, and i sympathized once upon a time, but quite frankly i have never received emotional support from you. and despite the craving in my heart for acceptance from his father i know i never will. i wanted to do this for you today because i wanted to show i care, but it turns out that it did not matter. you were going to be upset and unhappy anyway, no matter what i did. yes, i was thinking of trying to go driving today, and to practice and everything, but i guess it never mattered. well, if i lucked out and did well, maybe it wouldn t turn out so bad. i am almost . i am going to try and kill myself on my birthday. for real this time, i will have a last day with everything i wanted to do, and then i will ditch my phone somewhere north and go as far as i can go without anyone else finding me. i think that is fine. it is just hard to rationalize because i am still making plans with people for next week. hard to have to explain to them, and i guess to you, how much i will miss being alive. i want to blame you for this, and there is a part of me that wants to hurt you in retribution for all the pain you have caused me that does, but i know it is pointless, both because you wouldn t understand what i meant, and even if you did you d never be able to comprehend what you have actually done to me. i should know, i have tried explaining to you. i guess common sense really does not apply to everyone, huh. i do not really want anything sweet for my birthday. if i had to pick a present, it would probably be something like, being happy. or not wanting to cry so often. just something small, for me. there is so much i really wanted to have said, but i guess that is fine. i do not even know if i hate you, because i do not think that is true. maybe i do, but i feel guilty about it, because it really is not entirely your fault. it is a frustration that i was born without parents that understood me, and a world that had no place for me, that i was forced to carve my own path through, and yet it burdened me with things that took away my ability to do so. it feels unfair, but i know you do not care, you never did about the suffering that you saw was beneath your own experiences. i know you never truly understood my struggle with fighting for my own existence, because you flew through it without taking a scratch yourself, and you should be proud of that achievement. if i offer some advice however, maybe do not look down on those who are not having as much luck as you did in getting through your trials. i do not know, my suicide might be a wake up call for you, but i highly doubt it. you re immune to anything that will change your mind, except stuff that proves you re right. if anything, this will just confirm all your worst theories about me. maybe this way you ll feel freed enough to go and marry someone else and finally live the remainder of your life happy and unrestrained by what you perceive to be the failures of your life. i do not know how i am going to do it yet. but that is alright. i still look back on those times i stood by the tracks. it is almost years since i decided that i would try to fix myself. i do not know how far along i have even come, and it feels like i have done nothing good in the time since. i held out for almost years. that is more than i deserved or expected i guess. i do not know what i should do anymore. there is plenty of things i can decide to work on but, i just do not think there is any point sometimes. years. wow. i feel like that is been long enough, i suppose.	not depression
everytime you feel like you have found out the cure, you soon realise you have just scratched the surface. i think depression is something deeper than just feeling down. i am and had a real bad bout of depression when i was and . things have been good since then as i learnt a lot and made things easier for myself. the past few weeks have been great. i finally have a picture of what i want in life. i recently got accepted into a grad school and things in general have been going well but today something just hit me. a familiar feeling. my old acquaintance. ah we meet again. why, it is been so long, how nice of you to visit today. but i did not invite you. oh? you just barged in. well, guess i have to make room for you today. it is almost like i forgot what it really feels like. the way it consumes you. all of you. you become helpless thoughtless beingless. the lump in your throat. the gravity in your stomach. it is such a unique feeling but i did forget about it, at least for a while. once it hit me, i could not help but reminisce about my past. the nostalgia is almost poetic. most of me hates this feeling but there is a part of me that absolutely craves it. this is why i am lead to believe that depression is not something you can completely erase. even if you re okay for a few years, it might creep up on you inadvertently. i guess what i am saying is to not think of it as something you wish you did not have but rather focus on how you can make the most of yourself despite these awful feelings and hope that they go away for a while. i hope that reading this might give you a perspective and help you live the life you deserve. thanks for reading. i am out!	moderate

i have felt so bad lately and i really need some help this is my first time posting here and i think i need some advice or something. so for some backstory my childhood was not the greatest. i have been a huge fan of games and movies since i was a little child and yeah i usually got what i wanted but that is not the point here. when i was or years old my mother met her new man and they started dating and so on. soon after they started to date he was all over me not like in sexual manner but he used to hit me and keep my head underwater and lock me in sauna and even kept me from eating sometimes. and he always did these things when i did something that he thought was wrong like not cleaning up my room, being late or if i did not do any homeworks. and he even did it in front of my mom sometimes and she did nothing to prevent it they even had a kid and got married. of course when my step brother was born i got blame for every little mistake that i made and if my brother fell over then i got the blame and i was hit by my stepfather. only one who believed me when i told about this was my dad is aunt who was my best friend and who always had my back but she was really old like but she was everything to me back then because i did not have any friends and i have always been that lonely kid. when i grew up my dad is aunt died and soon after my grandmother and those two were really important to me and i did not even cry when they died because all that i felt was deep emptiness that i still feel to this day even though i do not want to admit it. it left a deep void in me that i have tried to fill up for years and sometimes it has worked and i have felt happy but soon after it has only gone downhill. after my real first relationship in th grade ended when she cheated on me and went with another one and soon after that i have always felt really not so good about myself and i even thought about killing myself because life just felt so worthless but then came this another girl who first understood me and tried to help me and she did for a while and so we ended up talking for many months before we started to date and that was the worst relationship that i had ever had because it involved a lot of arguments and she blamed me about everything and i reacted the wrong way and i cheated on her and it left me with so much guilt that after few months it told her about it and i wanted to break up and so after that i avoided relationships and pretty much any human contact for months until a new girl came into my life and we dated for few months and we broke up because i was a real mess and after few months we decided to try again and everything was going on really good until my mental issues surfaced and they pretty much messed up everything. well few months i was diagnosed with depression and ocd and i sometimes i get these intrusive thoughts that makes me question everything in my life but mostly it focuses on my relationship. like those thoughts range from you do not feel for her anymore , you do not love her anymore to just end this relationship and it makes me question that do i have feelings for her still. sometimes i get this feeling of deep emptiness and sometimes it comes when i am alone and when i am with her and it scares the hell out of me. like i want to enjoy my life with her but my mind struggles so hard to make me feel like that i do not want to be with her anymore and sometimes it feels so real that i even start to believe it. i have told her about these and she has promised to help me in anyway that she can so she is very understanding. this is also concerning to me because we have not had any problems in our relationship and soon we have dated for a year. she was my ex before but we broke up because i was acting like an asshole and she still had feelings towards her ex so we broke up but then i did not know about it even though i asked her many times. and when we got back together she did not tell me about it and i had to find out myself and i felt really bad because she lied to me back then but now everything has been fine in our relationship and we have both worked on those old issues and are no longer keeping secrets but i can not find out why i feel like this. like is this because of my mental problems or is this relationship genuinely not good? sometimes i feel like ending everything would be a good choice because then i wouldn t have to feel anything anymore and just be gone from everyones life.	moderate
i am not sad anymore just painfully numb, everything seems so dull and dreary. i wake up in the morning and already start wishing the day would end so i could go back to sleep. i get so bored i start hurting myself to feel something other than just nothing, but i dont feel that either. and despite all that i do not think i have depression or any mental illness, i used to think so since i was sad the whole time and hated everything and everyone, but now nothings there... i want to go back to those miserable times cause misery seems better than nothing at all	moderate
years later why am i dreaming of her almost and half years later? a little back story, i had a crush on this girl i met back when we were in th grade, fast forward to my senior year of high school. i still like this girl years later, i finally tell her that i like her, well i tell her that i was in love with her. she did not feel the same. i was heart broken, completely devastated. any way we graduate, and i go to college and meet a few new girls who i eventually start to have a crush on, mind you i did not go back to school until a year and half later. but i started to heal and move on, i started to talk to new people and new girls got rejected by all of them but the point is i thought i moved on. it felt like i did. i did not even think of that girl from hs that i used to like, not at all. so why all this time later am i now thinking about her all the time? i have fr have different dreams about her in the last month and a half. and every time i wake up i almost cry because who knows why, but i do not and my chest hurts from all this emotional pain over this. i even went as far as to ask her years later why she turned me down. she says she never really saw me like that and only saw me as a friend. and i said i get it and completely understood and got my closure to put it lightly. so i got my answer. so why am i still dreaming about her and have feelings for her ? i thought i moved on, it is been what feels like forever, a lot has happened to me , to make me a better person. i just do not know why i can not get over her. my mind wants to, my heart does not.	not depression
cried my way into i was talking to my friend and i said how i was left alone for new years and said how i hated it and was upset depressed. i told him i had cried earlier and was upset that i was so lonely, but i put a clown emoji and a peace sign with it to not have it be that serious, because i am a train wreck and had to make it lighthearted somehow. he replied with you can go snapchat insert my ex is name here in a serious tone and i started crying then got mad since i blatantly told him i was sad depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a lighthearted mood to the conversation. then he acts like he is the victim because he was insanely insensitive. so i am starting the new year at rock bottom, and it can either go up probably not , stay the same most likely , or i will die and be done with it least likely because i am a wimp .	moderate

i do not have real problems i know i do not have real problems, i have a great family, cool childhood and have everything. i know that i take this for granted or forget sometimes. even with all that i have kind of always felt this thistance with everything and like i dont deserve it. like i will always be out of place. not sure if its depression but sometimes it gets really bad. like the past few days...not sure if the holidays make it worse but i want to die. that word makes it sound really dramatic but really i do not want to be here. it is too much and i am not enough. i was just texting a friend this morning. we re internet friends never met irl but we have been talking for almost a year . i thought about how if i blow my brains out, he would have no idea. and that kind of hurt. he is a sweetheart. i truly have not been ok for the past few months, it gradually got worse until last night i was looking out the balcony hours into the new year and i wanted to bash my head onto the ground. i dont know how to reach out. i dont know how to talk if someone else reaches out. i dont know how to keep going but i do not want to hurt anyone.	moderate

i do not know how much more i can handle. this is going to be a long post because in order for you to realize the depth of everything i have to start from where everything started going wrong which was . i was in , me and my family were estranged except for the people who lived in my house, and my fathers parents. so it is other people as a support system. i started homeschooling a little before this point. my mom was getting sicker and was bed ridden and i remember waking up on january st with the intent of everything going back to normal and me helping everything smoothly. by the end of it i could not walk without crying. i went through blood tests plenty of mri is some with radiation some without and it they came down to....absolutely nothing. they never found out what was wrong with me and after months of physical therapy they stopped and never fixed my problem....my pain tolerance grew but every step i take hurts to this day. but lets back track a bit to the first week of , one morning my dad came home and he was silent which was alerting. my mother and i were both in her bed together drawing and resting and he told me that my beloved grandmother died and just minutes later my mom would go in for a blood draw and biopsy. so my siblings and i sat in the car well we waited for my mom and dad to come back out of the hospital, i did not know for a week or two more but my mother breast cancer and had a surgical removal later in the year. that is all my trauma for . this year i had depression and different eating thisorders but i met the most important person in my life and one of my best friends who we ll call thomas, she has helped me beyond believe will all my mental health issues and its probably the only reason i am around. we met and talked often and she helped me but my parents all through this were reading my messages and learned everything i said, about my self harm and everything and instead of helping me they yelled at me for hours, invalidating my feelings tell me that i was copying her and that i did not have any issues. they started yelling more at me for not cleaning the entire house or doing everything their list said to do. but i got through it. my parents seperated me from my friend but after a little time i tracked her back down on the internet and were still really close. at the start of this year i met this guy he seemed really nice and we were together for months before he tried to use me. he tried forcing me into sexual situations and it got really out of hand so i kept my mouth shut and broke up with him. my parents started yelling more at me and my father even called me a fuck up and failure. by the end of the year i was ready to enter the dating pool again and i met this new guy and when shit started to fall apart i realized how wrong i was about him after i found out he was cheating on me with other girls. my best friend of years moved away because her parents could not finance the area anymore this year i was just so destined to live better but my life does not operate like that. my parents started taking trips for a couple days and its always so hard when they get back but this was the worst moment of my life. my sister was having trouble sleeping and then he yelled at her and my parents got into a fight and my dad hit my mom. after that moment i am not sure how i am suppose to get on...now i do not feel like myself and i can not look at myself in the mirror...i do not recognize the person i do not know if its depersonalization depression or gender dysphoria all i know its i covered all the mirrors because i could not stand it anymore i hate my long hair but my dad calls it his head which makes my mom so mad but what am i suppose to do. it took me years to convince him to let me get my first hair cut. its hard to sleep i usaully only get or hours a night and i barely can stand having to talk to people. after everyday i lock myself in my room and just lie on my floor and cry for a few hours. i have tried to convince my parents i need help but they think its all fake. even after they saw my self harm marks. i am not sure how i could make it through the next . years....they always target me, my sister is the golden child and they buy her stuff and she never has to clean i just do not know how to go on when it feels like the weight of everything is on my chest and dieing would be easier. i can not do any of this anymore its too much. can anyone help me ? i want to keep living but its so hard when i can not even be myself.	not depression

a bad day? a depressive episode? an overreaction? i do not know anymore. first i would like to say i am currently diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety, and since i am taking mg of lexapro generic . so, a friend and i had been watching a tv show together and last week we watched the final episode. the show itself was dark and emotional, and the last episode was especially emotional because it implied that the main characters had died they did not . i felt a bit off afterwards but i just thought it was a normal reaction to finishing a show i liked. the next day i woke up feeling okay ish, but as the day went on, i became more and more upset and thistressed. i started obsessing over the tv show thinking what if they really died? and i could not stop fixating on it, even though there was proof i was wrong. and even though there was positive things to think about that happened in the show, i did not care about them, i just focused on everything negative. i began to lose interest in things, things i liked to do or anything else. i did not want to listen to music, i did not want to play games or watch videos. i did not feel like smiling or laughing. i did not want to eat or drink anything. everything felt like too much effort. sometimes i would just stare at the wall and cry because i felt so hopeless. i did not want to do anything but lay in bed and agonize and obsess over that stupid tv show, my brain just pumping out sad or upsetting what if, what if, what if questions. this lasted for days. i felt so stupid and dumb, like why are you this upset over something like this? . i felt stupid going to the doctor and talking to my therapist about it. my therapist suggested that maybe i have had a build up of stress over the past months and the tv show was what triggered it, and i asked well if that is the case, then why did i just focus and obsess so much on the tv show and nothing else? why not on the other things in my life? and she did not know. my therapist and mom would say things like well it did not last that long this time and even on medication you ll still have down days and i am just confused and frustrated. so, that is all it is? was what i went through just a bad day? is that normal? i have to go through something like that again? i can not watch a damn tv show i like in case something like this happens again? it did not feel like a normal reaction, i felt horrible, i did not feel like myself. but still i wonder if i am just overreacting about this whole thing. i had not had a bad episode in a long time, and i do have a tendency to get obsessed with things that i like. maybe it was not depression, maybe i am just a sensitive person, maybe this is just something i have to deal with and get used to. i am just really scared, i do not want to go through that again, and i am scared that there is nothing that can help me or prevent this from happening again.	severe

killing myself would be great for my husband. today was a bad day and when he came home and all i said to him was that i was not ok he just looked at me and told me he has to work tomorrow and to go take a bath. i sat in the tub in the dark for i dont know how long before i decided to try to break off my glasses and use any sharp edges to slit my wrists. unfortunately for me, they are cheap plastic and just warped instead of breaking off at the metal part. after a few tries he comes upstairs and just busts the door open it was locked and didnt even speak, but i knew he wanted me to put the kids to bed. since this happened all i can think is how much he probably is just hoping i commit suicide because it is a get out of jail free card. he is no longer married to me but no hassle of a divorce he can get a new girlfriend he actually wants to sleep with if he doesnt already have one people will always want to offer to babysit when a dead parent is involved so all the free time he wants he can get rid of all of my stuff and the kids stuff i hold on to for sentiment my kids dont deserve a mom who flies off the handle and yells and cries all the time anyways so they will be better off. me being stupid and a coward is all that holds me back. but i know it will be any day now.	moderate

therapist and doctor said i might have depression but it does not feel like i have it i am currently seeing both a therapist and a doctor, and they are both saying that i might have depression. i have been feeling really really down for a year but it does go up and down, though i would say it is mostly down. but when they mention depression it just feels really wrong. i know i am not the happiest person anymore, i have lost almost all hope and faith, but depression does not seem right. i still go to school, i do my work, i socialize, i sleep right, i eat right, it is just my mood that is really changed. i do not know if depression is just different for me or if it is really depression, i feel like it is not that bad?	severe

i tried to killmyself, now feel even more lonely. on wednesday night, i overdosed on co codamol and citalopram, went unconcious on my bedroom floor and my brothers found me and called an ambulance. woke up in a amp e trauma room with an airway tube down my throat and on a drip. stayed the next day and night on a ward receving nac treatment and spoke to a mental health nurse for about ten minutes. i did not want to go inpatient, so agreed to home treatment instead i have been inpatient before and fully hated it . turns out home treatment means a nurse came to see me at home for minutes, spoke to me a little and then left. now i have an appointment with my cpn in over a week is time. i am just sat at home feeling so alone and forgotten. my family and friends speak to me still but it all feels so strange, like i should not be here. i do not feel completely safe and do not have any plans to attempt anything, and i do not want to go back to hospital. what options do i even have now? i find it incredibly difficult to open up to people and it takes months to start trusting mental health workers. i know that if i went back to hospital or rang for my suicidal thoughts, they would almost certainly put me back as an inpatient on a mental health ward. and since i do not want that, what else can i do?? i feel so helpless and stuck, my chest is heavy and i am scared.	severe

anyone else take wellbutrin and if so do you get side effects i weaned off celexa and onto wellbutrin because after being on celexa for about years primarily for anxiety in the last year or two my motivation to do anything has dropped so i wanted to find something that could better help my depression and improve my motivation. i have been on the wellbutrin about a month and a half and after the first ish weeks of which i weaned off the celexa, by early to mid afternoon on most days i now crash with fatigue and exhaustion. also get mild nausea, sometimes a long with the exhaustion and sometimes by itself. also i can not say the wellbutrin is actually making a positive difference with my depression and motivation but i do sleep thru the night virtually every night which i did not do on the celexa. the wellbutrin has also caused intense dreams but never nightmares. in all honesty i am feeling more depressed due to the fact that i physically feel like crap by evening. really wonder if the fatigue and exhaustion is side effects from the wellbutrin or if its withdrawal symptoms from being off the celexa.	severe

i have never been officially diagnosed.... i am sorry and i feel ashamed about it, but i also i feel like the people in my life would be ashamed if they knew, and that is what is keeping me from saying anything or getting help. i had two mental health checks when i went to the obgyn a couple years ago. the first was the initial and the second time they had to have a follow up because i answered like i needed help. i lied the second time because my mom asked me about it and i was afraid to talk to her about it. so i stick to toughing it out, trying self care apps, and making secret accounts to vent or use when i am in a mood. all i can say is that it is not fun to suffer in silence.	severe

embrace yourself it is important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. they are the thing that makes you alive. do not lose touch with your emotions. embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience. to experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. if you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. see, the concept of darkness can not exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. the same thing applys to the concept of feeling. so do not fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure. i have been trough depression by myself and i know how hard it can be sometimes. sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. you wish you were never born into existence. but that is ok, because it does not matter, nothing matters after all. do not take life too serious, it is a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. so then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, i say it is okay, because you re being loved. man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun alan watts	not depression

college is making my depression close to unbearable i have been in college for almost years now going for computer science and last semester and the current one i am in have been gradually taking their tolls on me. i have had to fight with my depression since i have started college but these past two semesters have been particularly awful. i transferred to a university this semester after being at a community college for . years and i feel like that may have to do with it somewhat? i also think i am just very scared and depressed of the future, as i am halfway done and am looking into internships and such. my current semester i am struggling in all of my classes and it is hard keep up. i dont have the motivation to try and learn what all my professors arent teaching me and i am terrified to ask for help because i am afraid of being looked at as a dumbass, which is a really hard thing for me. aside from that, i find it increasingly hard to be around people and when i am alone, all i can think about is how i want to just leave leave college, leave everything, leave this world. but i want to accomplish getting a degree because that would be big for me. the past probably two weeks it has gotten really severe. it is hard for me to enjoy or do anything and sometimes all i can do is lay in bed and try to convince myself not to end it. balancing college and depression is turning into a losing battle for me at this point and i am unsure what to do.. i am constantly going back and forth between trying to keep myself motivated and just feeling like a failure but it seems i am feeling like a failure more than anything lately. i just can not help but wonder if i will make it through college and if i can even get anything after college because of this. i just feel very alone and kinda hopeless at this point i hope this doesnt sound dumb but i needed to say this.	moderate
would not stop loving him so i can not and would not ever stop loving him. i have tried everyday and i can not let go of him. i will never love anyone else and i have accepted that. it is basically like i am mourning the death of someone and would not ever recover from it. i wish i could just fucking die.	not depression
so i just got done tearing up all my old adoption books so first things first i was adopted at birth. guess my birth parents wanted me about as much as everyone else in my life has so far. either way, my adopted mom bought me a few books in relation to adoption to read when i was young. where is said adopted mom now you ask? in another state, with her new husband, my older brother whom she manipulated into moving in with her, spending her days lying to all her friends about what a horrible daughter i am for abandoning her, about how her ex husband divorced her when it was the other way around, conveniently never thiscusses the money she steals from my dad every month, believing she is worthy of it because of the kids i raised , and has not spoken to me in over a year because i blocked her after she straight up forgot to answer a phone call we scheduled to have! so yeah. why should i look at a bunch of books all dedicated to to reminding me how much an adoptive family should love their child just as much as a birth child, when that was never the case for me? and when my adoptive father also has mental problems and a drinking problem but refuses to get help, and complains about how in debt he is and how bad his physical health is when he would not get any help for that either? yeah he has to pay my mom a scathing amount every month, but still. he is admitted he does not want to work because he is depressed but he would not get help for his depression. but still feels the need to say things like, i do not know how much longer i can do any of this. and talk about losing is job and if he does will definitely lose our house. see, i do not get to talk about my problems. cause i clearly do not have any. but everyone else sure as hell does! and as stated before my one older brother lives with my mom and being the lying, manipulative, gas lighting, snake she is she convinced him not to have anything to do with the rest of the family. and my oldest brother is too busy with his beloved wife and life of his own to really understand the problems the rest of us face. and here i am, caught up in the middle of it all. screw this. i almost died at birth, and now i really wish i had. but still, one big happy family! am i right!?	moderate
why can not i commit suicide? i can not do things anymore i have been living with it for years of constant suicidal ideation and failed attempts as of tonight. i had the pills in my hand, took half of them and ended up throwing them back up before i could get the rest down. i hate living and it is too painful to keep trying and falling back worse. i have been through intensive therapy, been admitted and sectioned before none of it has helped, nothing releases my pain or anger i just end up making it worse. but my body is physically rejecting my attempts against my will if i cut myself, my arm jerks and i end up with minor cuts it i take pills i those them up. how do i get around the fact that my own body want me to be in pain?	severe

today i broke down at work... this morning started off terrible with a leak of unknown origins in my car that seemed a lot like brake fluids with the information i had. overall i have a good time at work since its really the only place i ever go that is social . today i got so overwhelmed with not only a clog of my own work but busy helping others because they were in the space i needed and the area itself was a complete trip fall hazard. i spent minutes helping another department while those in that department thisappeared. i got so frustrated and upset i just started crying and once i cry there is no hiding it because my eyes turn super red like i am stoned out of my mind. one of my supervisors came and checked up on me multiple times once he found out. and several coworkers gave me hugs and one even took over what i was doing so i could take a minute break instead of the usual . i wanted to spend it alone in my car and when i walked outside i remembered i did not even drive to work today so my car is at home so i sat in the basement instead of the break room. back to my supervisor because this really made my day and it meant a lot to me the last half hour in the shift he pulled my aside and wanted to makw sure nothing happened and that he did not put too much pressure on me because of what was happening he did not but the fact that he seemed to genuinely care about what happened and what he could do to make sure it did not happen again meant a lot.	moderate

i tried to clean up, but i am losing motivation quickly. i know that probably sounds lazy. someone convinced me yesterday to try cleaning up, as i had not done so in a while, so i got out of bed this morning and did not get food for fear of falling back into the same routine. i have been listening to music, having a nice time, and cleaning my room for an hour or two, but now i am losing the will to stand, let alone continue cleaning. this place really is a mess, and i am angry with myself for letting it get so bad. i was really looking forward to taking out all the garbage, doing some washing, and donating any clothes that i do not need because i am sure that somebody needs clothes right now. i also really like sorting things and having a system, but everything is a thisaster. i have taken out more things than i actually put back, and the only reason why i have not given up and gone back to bed is because my bed is covered in clothes and such right now. i would have to move it whether i was going to continue cleaning or not, or i would have to sleep on the floor. i hate that i am like this.	not depression

do you ever get out of depression? i used to be a jolly person, who enjoyed life with no regrets. those years of my life, i never looked back and and made the most of it. then, i just hit the rock bottom of my life and its been years since then that i have not felt myself. i can hardly make any friends and even if i do, they are least interested in me. i do not know what else to. i work x harder than i used to before to get out of this mess and still i do not get the desired results. it feels like i just come back to where i was before. this depression is just eating me alive. i felt like quitting it already but my parents are good people, they care and always do but i just do not want to burden them anymore and i already have let them down so many times. they work very hard and i do not want to add up to your burden. therapy does not work well for me because all they do is recommend is some pills and then ease the pain but how do i end this pain? i just want to be appreciated guys, i am tired of failing and still trying my best again the next day and yet failing again. this is so exhausting. why is life is fair to be when i can not even get one thing right and i am simply good for nothing. why?????	severe
so i have concluded a few things people only pity me. my ex girlfriend stayed with me because she pitied my life. i do not ask for pity, i do not complain about my life, i am sorry that it is inherently shit and everyone close to me notices. my own friends just pity me, i do not want pity anymore.. it is ruined me. i have no true friends and i talk to myself constantly, write paragraphs about how much i hate myself into my notes, and have attempted suicide multiple times. it is one of those things where i can not even go out without the voices in my head intensely telling me how much of a piece of trash i am to be in existence. all i have ever done is fuck things up. i am so tired of normal people telling me life is great. for me it is not. you do not deal with the kind of thoughts i deal with, and have dealt with me entire life.. i do not ask for advice so stop force feeding me it. i just want to die, i will finally feel no stress, no anxiety, and the fact i would not have a consciousness anymore is comforting enough of a thought for me.	moderate

anyone else want what they can not have? i want to be the next generation defining nba legend, the mj, lebron, the kobe, of my generation and i am willing to put in the work because basketball is the love of my life, and at times it is like heroin to me. there is nothing in this world besides my love for the game that i wouldn t sacrifice to achieve this dream of mine i would willingly sacrifice any family, friends, lovers, in order to achieve this. but talent does not allow me to do so. i am not feet and i am not athletic at all. my game is all skill, but skill only gets you so far. i want to be rich, to spend my life hooping and outside of hoops i want to game out and use my status as an athlete to promote my content, i want all the perks of wealth, and i want to eat really good food everyday and use my wealth to start a restaurant. i want to get away from all the people i know now and get the sweetest revenge by coming out as the top dog and living a life others could dream of. i want to be the best at what i do, and i am not going to be humble about it in front of the people from my past like my family and friends that all doubted me. but no. i do not understand why i can not have that, why i have to live in a world where everyday is really just one big chore and i survive by trying to chase a dream that might not even happen. i survive based on little moments, i survive based on hope, i survive because i fear the boredom of dying. they call me a pessimist but i am the ultimate optimist i truly want to die yet i am forcing myself to stay alive. basketball, working out, and video games are all drugs to me i act like an addict on withdrawal without those. i cope everyday, besides those, by watching porn, stress eating, and writing stuff. at this point, i am living life only to be happy and only for my happiness.	not depression

first day of a a new year full of old shit ever since i was about i started to realize that what i was going through was not normal. i was and still am extremely depressed, but it came in waves. i am now and have tried to kill myself times and ended up in the hospital times. my family has in no way supported me and constantly tries to put me down. everytime i try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention. they make me move schools about every months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. currently they are home schooling me which means i sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about hours. i can not go outside and all social activities are banned i guess you would say. everything in my house is under lockdown. for christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. i have to ask for everything and most times the answer is not just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture. going into this new year i can not think of anything good that is going for me and i genuinely feel like trash. i got a really bad wave of pure helplessness and started to cut myself, i stopped myself before it got too bad but my arm is currently fucked up again. i dont know what i am doing with my life and i sure do not know what i am doing here. i guess i am just hoping i am not the only one going through this. fuck new year s. it is just a holiday that makes you realise what a fucking shitty year you had and now you have to do it all over again.	moderate
tips for beating depression hi guys, i have moderate to severe depression since about . in the last years i have found myself ruminating about past trauma and embarrassments non stop. i have tried cbt, albeit only for weeks and have tried citalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine, mirtazapine and qutiapine. the only small success i had with these was with the latter, before my depression just came back harder. does anybody have any suggestions? i am thinking of paying for private cbt sessions, probably over a week period. are there any other medications or ways you can think to beat this? i am a fairly active year old male with a fairly good job and social life. i play football and go to the gym. from the outside i feel many people would think i have got a great life, which makes it even sadder. i feel as if i am getting to the end of my tether with this and i can not imagine progressing in life and starting a family etc with my current state of mind, very worried. many thanks in advance.	moderate

impending cycle of doom i need help. i recently got out of an inpatient facility which was great, and now i am back out in the world. well, not really. i am doing an outpatient program which is helpful and all but i always want to cut myself. i do not want to die but the urge to cut is overwhelming. a plus, i think all my friends hate me. before i was inpatient i was going through a really rough time with a few people at school and they really abandoned me when i needed them most. i mean they just really shit on me when i already wanted to kill myself. i told my friend that i wanted to kill myself and was pretty convinced that i was going to and he shrugged it off. did not tell anyone or express concern which was thisappointing but i guess you can not ask people to always do that right thing. luckily i broke down and therapy and ended up in the er before i could overdose on ativan, trazedone, and vodka. i am out now and doing better but my friends are being shit and i am really craving to cut. it is fucked up but the feeling of cutting is indescribable and impossible to duplicate. i guess i do not want to but i do not know how to stop myself.	severe
 and empty i am able to take care of work, bills and act upbeat at work and in certain social situations, but when i am by myself or with my girlfriend i feel frustrated, upset with myself and sometimes have thoughts of suicide. i feel out of love awhile ago, feel guilty to admit. the woman in with seems to be my biggest fan and puts so much faith into me. maybe my perspective is off, but i really think that she is emotionally dependent on me and it is a drain i am her only friend it seems. i feel obligated to keep her happy and entertained it is exhausting. i always thought that if i hit a certain mark in my career, gained some sort of financial independence i have these things now that this feeling of thispair would go away, but it has not. i laugh at myself that i am motivated to write this bs on a reddit post...it is therapeutic in a way . some history depression does run in the family. lost my sister and an uncle to suicide. my father made an attempt. i used to cut, but now i strike myself in the head when i get frustrated. i was addicted to methamphetamine in my earlier s and have been clean from that about years. last year i suppose i broke my sobriety with psychedelics they have admittedly been very helpful. i am able to see things clearly. not sure exactly where i am going with this, but was just curious to see if there was a subreddit on depression and now that i see there is, i felt motivated to share a bit. take care everyone. ambivalence sucks. in time, i will get off the fence. famous last words no...ha! seriously though.	moderate

it sucks being the back up friend i have a group of friends i have kept in contact with from high school, and we all just graduated college. fortunately for me, everyone moved to the major city where i attended college and decided to stay. we have mentioned how fortunate and lucky we are that all four of us stayed in touch, actually liked one another in high school, and up to now in the beginning of our young adult lives, but sometimes i feel like the odd man out. like last night, i saw that the three of them went out, and i did not get the invite, which was fine. but then this morning, our group text was used to talk about brunch plans and everyone was chiming in, which is great. except the last text in the group before that was me trying to make brunch plans and nobody answered, which makes me feel like nobody wants to hang out if i am the one initiating plans. then, they started talking about things that happened last night, and so when i finally just said i am lost, one of them explained the situation to me and said that it was an impromptu meetup. i may just be overanalyzing this, but the only ways i see the impromptu meetup happening are if they individually texted each other and just did not want to invite me or that there is a separate group text where i am left out. it just really stinks because i genuinely think of these guys as my best friends, and i was so excited to have them here in my city. it is selfish to say, but with this happening, it feels less like my city to me and more like theirs where i am a side character. it feels like i am the back up friend when it is convenient.	moderate
i sorta beat social anxiety and now it created a bigger problem i m suffer from mild social anxiety but it used to be worse, so as a coping mechanism to not knowing how to socialize i make jokes, and a lot of jokes roasting myself in sometimes extreme manners, as i always do things. it made me less of a loser loner and more of a regular kid which is awesome for a teenager, but. as i said i make a lotta jokes about myself, and people think that they can too, seems logical, yet it is not, i can not take it, people make fun of everything i do. even when i find the courage to tell them i am not ok, which is hard considering i got sa, they somehow making fun of it later on. one time one girl i really thought was one of my best friends, along with a tiny bit of help from her friends, single handedly managed to make try to jumper under a speeding car i did not get hurt . it did not seem like me, i never thought i would try to kill myself, even in my darkest times. shit got worse when her two friends were trash talking me directly in front of me, while i was in midst of a mental breakdown that nobody was even remotely trying to stop. they said that they were thissappointed about my asshole behavior , which was literally a fucking mental breakdown ffs. there has not been much lately, and things seem like they are going a bit more smoothly, but i have missing these long writing sessions on reddit is finest rant subs. and i still feel very bad and lonely, so i thought i would share with other people who are in kinda the same boat.	moderate
i need to know if i am alone in my thoughts. i need to know if i am just crazy or maybe this makes sense to someone out there. life lately has... sucked for me to say the least. i dropped out of college this semester due to depression. i came home. now my anxiety has overwhelmed me. so many thoughts running through my head. i have no friends back home to hang out with. i do not have social interaction. i got turned away from an amazing job opportunity and it really took a blow to my self esteem. i have to mentally prepare myself before any social interaction now. i literally get drained from social interaction after the tiny bit of it that i have during the week. i lost interest in things i formerly enjoyed. i sit in bed every single day. my sleep schedule is awful. i sleep hours a day. however tonight i sit here before you all writing this at am. why am i awake you ask? because i have to change the oil in my car at pm today and i have been dreading the social interaction from it all night. how pathetic is that. but as i sit here in tears for the billionth time of my years of being on this planet, i have come to a realization. i am just a number on this planet. i mean nothing. i have the same worth as the ant on the street that you crush under your shoe. i have the same worth as the zebra being tackled by a lion on the serengeti, that you watch on nat geo. i have the same worth as the mosquito that you slap off your skin during summer nights. none of them have names, no one remembers their stories. the only thing people remember in each of these scenarios is their deaths. people in my life have talked about where they see themselves in the future. what job they have, if they get married or have kids, where they will live. me? no matter how hard i try, i see nothing in my future. black. over the past few years, i have gotten this overwhelming sensation that my time on this earth is extremely limited. like, i would not make it past my twenties. these past few days, i have started to thissociate, i have vivid intrusive suicidal thoughts that have started to make me realize that my time may be coming to a close. nothing feels real. i feel like i am floating. i am too much of a coward to purposely harm myself. but the thought of being dead and not feeling anything really brings me immense comfort. i can not explain it, but it is an intense warm feeling that i have never felt before. i am scared of what i just wrote, and honestly i am scared of how others will perceive it. but i have no one else to share my words with. and maybe if i do end up passing on soon, someone will come across my post on this sub and read just a fraction of what runs through my mind. thank you for letting me share this space with you all. i have no conclusion of what i am going to do honestly. my head is a cloud right now. i am absolutely petrified.	moderate
miserable college student i hate college. i hate myself. i hate everyone else who attends my college. i wish i could just lay in my bed in my dorm room all day, so i would not have to see anybody or do anything. i have no passions or interests, only tasks that i must complete so that i can return to laying in my bed. i used to be a high achieving student in high school in academics and athletics. now i am a washed up bum who can not perform the simplest of tasks correctly i am so pathetic. i had such high hopes of using the ivy league college i worked hard to get into as a spring board for a successful career, but i have already failed miserably. i do not have the skills one needs to make it in the real world. i feel so lethargic and weak. i struggle my way through sports practice everyday. i do not know how much longer i can keep going. i wish i could just thisappear and never be seen by anyone again. i am a complete fucking failure.	not depression

final thoughts. just wanted to deposit some feelings. i do not know why i am here and i do not know if this will make a difference. but i really just needed to deposit some thoughts. i am tired of this life. i have got no real friends and do not really feel connected to anyone. it is always been like this and i have always been the odd one in every social group i have been. i just have not felt sincerely understood for a while and i just can not find happiness in things anymore. i feel like a monster, i am miserable of myself. i do not even know what i am saying anymore at this point. every day is just worse and worse, i just feel so humiliated and embarrassed about myself, i have got nothing and no one. i have always been an outcast, and i feel like i just was not supposed to be and i actually was an accident indeed, i found out recently . this phase of my life has been going on for the past years of my life and i am tired of fighting myself and lying to myself everyday that things will get better. i am not stupid, i know that nobody sincerely wants to listen to my struggles, and if anything i can not blame these people, i wouldn t care about myself too if i were them. not even professionals, who get paid daily to help you cope with these kind of things actually care about your well being at the end of the day. nobody cares about me, it is simple, i have always been that person you go to because you re friends are not around or you do not even have any . and i have always been that person that you d pick the last on the team when you re a captain of a sports game. you wouldn t notice me if were gone, in fact, you wouldn t care or even be happy, some of you have even explicitly told me that you d wish i were gone. i am not good at anything and probably would not ever be, i just do not have anything to be recognized for. i offer nothing as a person and if anything i feel like a deadly weight to the people i care about, everyday. no matter how hard i have tried, i have tried both my hardest and not at all at times. people just do not like me, no matter what i do. i thislike myself too, i am tired of this life, i am just tired of all of this. i am contemplating suicide, but just have not figured out when and where to do it. i know sooner or later i will probably go through with it though. this pain is just stronger than any emotion i have felt in my life. yes, i have tried meds... but if anything they made it just harder for me to naturally find joy in things. i see all these talented people commenting on here about how they are feeling the same way as i do, but sincerely they just deserve the world. i am one of the few people and probably the only person who deserves to feel this way, because i am just a miserable person. i just wanted to get my feelings out there and want some of you all to know that you re not alone in this and that i sincerely think you deserve the world! i could not ever wish my pain to anyone. and please, if you read this, treat yourself well. i am sorry. goodbye.	moderate

descriptions i tried my best to describe how i feel when trying to fall asleep some nights, putting it in words and posting it somewhere really helps, even if nobody really gives a damn in the end you turn off the light in your bedroom, and place your phone on the charger. the math has been done, if you immediately go to sleep now you ll get exactly hours of rest before you have to wake up. upon hitting the pillow, you just lay there. it only takes a few seconds, before you partake in the most dangerous game, actually thinking. all of a sudden, you feel a wave of sadness rush over you, seemingly originating from your stomach. feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and pure sadness. why am i sad? , you ask yourself. you lie there thinking, but you really can not find a good reason. before long, you are thinking about your entire life. what am i doing wrong? , why do i struggle so much to socialize? , do i hold any real value to this world? , these questions are racing through your mind. if you dropped dead, would anyone mourn? probably, but would they really? no, but yes they would? all you can do is go back and forth, thinking of ideas and immediately doubting yourself and your own validity. do not even bother asking why you are like this, and then a wave of anxiety rushes over you as you remember you were trying to sleep. how long has it been? you think about reaching for your phone, but you do not. even though the phone is right there, to pick it up feels like it requires a mountainous amount of willpower and strength. after minutes of thinking about picking up the phone, you finally do. in the morning, nice going dumbass. do you really fuck everything up like this? you know you re worthless, and now you re going to be tired all day tomorrow. i applaud you, actual braindead moron. as you realize you were thinking those thoughts, small amounts of anxiety and pain flutter through your stomach. you must have something deeply wrong with you, but things are slowing down and not making much sense. at least you re finally falling asleep	moderate

coming up on my one year anniversary i was committed a year ago because i had a detailed plan. have had major depressive thisorder all my life, but it got progressively worse after i was dragged back to work in a job i hated two weeks after major surgery, and weeks before my surgeon wanted me to. that is a pain and a weakness i wouldn t wish on anyone. i was in a wheelchair for two weeks so i could still do my job, but i would feel my muscles tremble from sitting upright after only minutes. husband who can be the world is biggest jerk, and i refuse to defend him in this instance declared i wish you d just kill yourself when you say you want to during an argument that only he wanted to have he did not think i should have lunch so he would have more time to play cards, where his parents were going to feed him. he really sounds like a major abuser, and he was and can still be . i kicked him out that day, and was going to go to work, then come home and take a hot bath. i figured it was the largest chunk of time before i would be missed. luckily, i had a counselor who knew something was horrifically wrong. after prodding, i spilled it all. she helped me get admitted to the hospital and stayed with me until a family member could come take me. i was scared sick, because my mom always stigmatized being committed because it would end your teaching career forever. can not have that, can we. while i was in the hospital, it all stopped, and it was insane for me. i knew i hated teaching, and i hated my job. i hated it all so much. i hated that i was constantly called to put my job and my husband is bank account ahead of my own sense of fulfillment. visiting hours were great, by the way. my mom and sister knew what my husband had said to me, and no one was their usual warm selves to him. in therapy sessions, i talked out what would happen if i abandoned my teaching career. it occurred to me that i still have the people skills, the problem solving, connections, etc, etc. when my certification expires... i do not have to renew it. the idea of a traditional classroom filled me with so much dread... i told my family, and the same day i was released, i went to my boss who i loved, it was my big boss that demanded i return to work. she is loved by no one . i did not bother with changing anything about my clothes, except to put on certain clothing items they confiscated. and i informed her i would be quitting at the end of the school year. period. two months into my unemployment, while we were in japan long story, do not ask i was thinking about what my therapist had once asked me what would you do you if you knew you could not fail? well, i had wanted to be a veterinarian when i was a kid up until i was ...and then my depression told me it would never happen. i was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. i talked to vets, i read every single book i could find, it was my thing. i was that kid that people would bring their animals to look at, and i could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they would be mentally prepared for the bill. vet school was out, but i had researched veterinary tech programs while i was a teacher the problem was that they were all full time programs during the day. but hey, that was no longer a problem! i burst into tears when i realized that i had figured out why i needed to stay i had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me i had to. i applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in tokyo bay. husband, who did not know me back when i was weird animal girl, thought this was impulsive and out of nowhere. it was not until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it was not impulse. mom said oh, thank god, that is what i have been waiting to hear for years. she told my grandpa and his response was it is about damn time!! he had to realized that oh, no. this was a huge part of my personality he had not noticed i started classes three weeks later. every day, i am jazzed to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing i have always wanted. for the first time since i went into teaching, way back in , i feel hope. i still struggle with depression, obviously, especially because i have lapsed on therapy fricking copays ...but i maybe found the thing that will keep me going. being admitted really did end my teaching career forever.	severe

growing up is like a fever dream its just so surreal and awful, i hate it. all the close friends you had start to change. they stop caring as much about you and focusing more on their own lives. they start to become rational adults and take care of their responsibilities and dont appreciate your personality because you are stuck acting like a child and having a mentality of a child. its so fucking weird seeing the people you knew and how they were so unique and now theyre all changing and rationalizing their dreams and fitting into a mold of an adult. meanwhilei amstill acting like a fucking useless kid. i dont get it, i hate both sides, theres nowhere to go. i always wondered how grown ups got to be where they are, the people who steal or hate themselves or seem broken in some way, and i realize that this is the point, right after highschool is when the divide happens and everyone goes their separate way. i can telli amdiving into the path of becoming a scummy drain on society and probably fitting my own mold as well even though i dont see it. its just a pattern of losing all your close friends, being lonely, making shittier friends and surrounding yourself with shittier people, etcetera. all i want is people to care about me and friends to have my back but nobody else wants that. all adults do is care about themselves and stab each other in the back and that is what my whole world is becoming and i fucking hate it. i reject growing up and living but that rejection means nothing and only gets me trampled in the stampede of everyone else rushing to the finish line.	not depression
just a couple of feelings. and, hello, friends! it is january st, . i have never published anything in reddit before, but i found some posts here that encouraged me to write a little on my feelings. i have just graduated from high school in november i am not american nor living in europe . now i am about going to start my university studies. i am quite young, most of my colleagues were older than me, and i am younger than the average first year student in almost countries. i always felt somewhat misplaced and thisinterested in what young people do. i did not attend my class is prom party. at first, i was thinking financially, as it is not rational to expend a truckload of money in a stupid and small event. my mother got really upset with my decision, but i did not dare to explicitly say that i was worried about getting us into debt. after some months, my motivations to not attending it was not having established friendships with most of my classmates i had a few moments of unpleasantness with some of them, but i have no contempt for almost anyone. it was an elite school, with only eight people in the class, most of them extremely affluent. as well, utter all compliments i hear is about how smart i am, and i have a gracious complexion. i fell as having no true friends since i was little i got to be surrounded by adults. today, i was invited by a friend to some museums with her, but i do not feel as sharing secrets as i never could open myself on the pains physical and psychic ones to someone. every day, i fear ending up alone, as i am too avoidant or critical, applying the latter both to myself and to the significan not one, and i do not have hope on a great career or in a profitable marriage i live in the western world, but marriage for convenience is appealing. my father quit his job and now tries to succeed in life as a businessman, but the economic scenario in our country has never been good. this past year, my mother, who worked from home for a few years, went into a stable job, but it does not pay too well. through the year, i tried to make some money i intended to start investing and also to create an emergency fund, but i always dreamt about moving abroad considering i am going to study mathematics and astronomy i live in a hostile place to be a scientist, and there were a lot of relatives of mine setting up our documents to live in europe. i started to spend a lot of money using credit cards, but it was necessary, and then i have to start my savings all over again, after paying what i owe the bank. my dream university changed its calendar to entrance examinations in a way that i could not be admitted. i am going to matriculate myself in one of the most prestigious university in my country, as it has no tuitions and a demanding pace of studies, and studying abroad is no longer affordable. i have thought a lot on not studying astronomy or something as fine arts or philosophy, my other passions in favour of something that has chances of getting rich, as medicine. i can not take anymore what made me feel so out of place these past few years i do not have a boyfriend, i do not go to those promiscuous, opulent parties, and i do not travel around the world during the summer holidays. i can no longer delay my visits to doctors for not having the courage to tell someone what i feel, that my allergies weaken me more than ever, that my eyes burn like hell and every inch of my body hurts, and the fear of going to a psychiatrist. i tried therapy a few years ago, and the therapist was able to make me feel worse, as the school educational coordinator. i am always afraid of not being sufficiently grateful for what i have on earth, that i have a great background. poetry can make my breath somewhat lighter, but, consonant to my vision issues and to the stress i was subjected to, i was reading fewer books. i started to believe that i can only hold my life with missions to accomplish, and creating art, fortunately, was a solace in the plethora of trouble i got into, maybe for my future good.	moderate

i wouldn t be depressed if i was better looking people do not care about ugly ass people like me. i just like to imagine if i was good looking how much more people would care about me, but sincei aman unattractive guy no one will even bother being friends or in a relationship with me. i can not even look at pictures of myself without being reminded of how bad i look. my life would be completely different if i was tall and good looking. why good looking people deserve more than i do. the only difference between them and i is they happened to be born that way. people like me are always subconsciously thiscriminated against simply because of our appearance	moderate

a letter to my best friend dear sister, we were born in different families but fated to meet. i was so shy back then, so afraid of the world and how everyone thought of me. i was bullied for my differences from the crowd. i hated life back then, between the bullying and the abuse back home. and then like an angel, you appeared. you spoke to me as if i was human and showed me empathy. and although i never asked, you stood up for me and wiped away my tears. you were so beautiful to me, like a goddess and like the best friend i could ever wish for. of course you had your flaws, do not we all, but i adored you despite them. you were always so intelligent and bright but stubborn and short tempered. i know at times you do not feel loved but do you really need a lover to realize just how loved you are? just how special you are? you are incredible in so many ways. what makes you special? your big and loving heart. its not easy to see past the cover of a book to see its real beauty..but you..you do that better than anyone i know. i know life is hard and you re fighting a hidden war but you always were a fighter a warrior. look at the battles you have faced and how much stronger you are because you never gave up. i have always been proud of you for that. i know it is not much to offer but because i love you whole heartedly, you will always find a friend in me	not depression

depression is a chronic illness my sister is friend just got diagnosed with thyroid cancer at . she had to have her thyroid removed and will be fine, but it will be something she has to deal with for the rest of her life. she has gotten an outpouring of support from friends and family, just hundreds of people showering her with love. she has been very open with my sister and her other friends about how hard this has been for her, throwing off her life plan and setting her potentially on a difference course. i feel incredibly bad for her and recognize how horrible and life changing this is, but i also can not help but feel a little bit jealous. jealous that she can be so vocal about her frustrations and her illness and receive nothing but empathy and love from absolutely everyone. i developed major depression at about and it completely destroyed me and my life plan. it will be something i have to deal with everyday for my rest of my life, and i will never be the same. but i do not get to talk about it with people. while my sister is friend is labeled strong for dealing with her cancer, i am labeled weak for being depressed. people view her cancer as a problem she deals with while instead viewing me as a problem for having depression. even people who are generally sympathetic and kind still think this way and it shows in small ways. even my parents who are supportive and loving see my persistent depression as a failure on my part. i used to be beautiful, smart, and advantaged. but now i can not sleep, i can not think, i can not enjoy anything, i can not form meaningful relationships, and i see absolutely no future for myself. but worst of all, i can not talk about it because to other people it is something i have done to myself.	not depression

i have never felt so down or broken before. i really hate life. i really miss my parents. my dad died almost years ago when i was . i loved hanging out with him at work. he showed me so much. every young person needs a dad like him. it was so devastating when he died. the doctors kept telling me he was going to be alright. i was just a kid. i did not know better. it blind sided me when he died. my mom slipped into a deep depression. a couple of years after that she walked out on me. i lived a long time alone before i reconnected with her. i can remember my friends getting birthday presents, being with family at thanksgiving. it was an insane feeling getting used to just being alone. there were a few girlfriends but nothing serious. it is proven impossible to find a woman that will love me. amp x b the last year of my mom is life i was dating what i thought was the love of my life. when my mom got sick and was hospitalized i needed someone to talk to. i called my girlfriend at the time but she wouldn t pick up her phone. did not respond to texts. it did not take long to figure out she was cheating on me. it was a crazy situation. she was messing around with a married guy and the guy is wife spray panted my now exgirlfriend is car. police were calling and there was a lot to deal with. shortly after my mom died i received an audio file. someone recorded my ex girlfriend talking on the phone with someone about how she did not want to deal with me and my mom is death. that she did not have the time and better things to do. it was unbelievable how cold. i buried my mother alone. the time i should have been spending with my mom i was talking to the police until they figured out who was harassing my exgirlfriend. she destroyed the mourning time i should have had for my mother. this is something that i was carry with me for the rest of my life. this was a year and a half ago. i have been alone ever since. i have lost my sex drive and have nothing but contempt for dating. i have been in therapy but to be honest i do not think it working for me. i think this situation is not what most therapists deal with. someone that is been alone like i have and lost what i have probably is not fixable. i got a text recently from my exgirlfriend. she was begging me to meet her somewhere so she could apologize. i blocked the new number she texted me from. i do not want to see or hear from her again. i have moments when i want to get out there and meet someone. i will even go as far as to create a dating profile or go out where single people hang out. but when i look at women i just see this unreliable thing that is just going to hurt me. i am just reminded of my failures in dating and how every girl that is been with me just wanted to find someone else with complete thisregard to my feelings. it would be different if things just did not work out. if i could get a sorry but this is not working for me speech. that you can not argue with. that you can get over. i have never felt this broken or sad. i feel like since she cheated on me while my mom was dying in the hospital then who can you trust? now it is too late. when i needed someone the most they screwed me over. the world had it is chance to impress me with it is compassion but it showed me how horrible people can be instead.	moderate

why does food always work for my depression i have tried medication, therapy, and i even went to a crisis center to get help with my depression. but the medication did not work, i felt like my therapist was not helping that much, and i felt more depressed at the crisis center because there were people there who were worse off than me. even before i got professional help, i would always rely on food to make me happy and it always did. every time i eat, i feel so much better. even though, people call me a pig and tell me to lose weight, i do not give a f. as long as i do not get obese, i just want to rely on food. it is the only thing that makes me happy. having friendships with people does not make me happy as they just betray me and i regret putting all that effort in just to pretend that i am okay. i think that i will be fine off alone.	moderate

my birthday, that day something snapped. punched a damn hole in my wall due to overwhelming emotions. i thought everything was still, you know, quiet at least. but i can feel something within me. i felt it on my birthday but i thought it was another wave of anxiety like normal. but over the past few days i feel so much rage and negativity. so bad that my mother and close friends noticed and pointed it out. i get lost in monologue about why i hate certain things and suddenly i realize what i am saying and cut myself off. i honestly do not know what is going on but i am trying to keep it contained. i have been focusing on little victories like smiling, writing again and pushing myself to carry on conversations, helping others. maybe i have finally lost it. full blown personality shifts. thoughts that are not mine. opinions that are not mine. maybe i have gone insane and do not know it yet. do not know if i even would. yesterday i got overwhelmed by anxiety and depression and rage i punched a hole in my wall. had to cover it up with old pictures i have drawn. have not told anyone in my home yet. i do not want my mom to know it is gotten worse. especially when i am almost certain i can contain it. i just have to keep doing good things. thistract myself from all this shit. that is pretty much all i wanted to say on this post. i will talk more later more than likely, typing keeps me busy as well as not bottling what is going on.	severe

suffering is life and life is suffering, and when you think your soul can not be smashed any further... i could write a list of life changing tragedies i have endured but you d think it was fiction. from falling feet and smashing bones and organs, to being robbed at gunpoint, to having my home and belongings trashed by a hurricane, to divorce, to joblessness and homelessness, body wracked with pain, painkiller addiction and liver thisease, etc etc and more... but those things are in the past right? but they are in my head everyday, and every night, and only sleep brings peace but i am unable to sleep more than an hour before waking up feeling sick. i have heard it all... god has a plan for you , time heals everything , our struggles make us stronger , there is always someone worse off than you , etc etc. so why am i still here? why bother dragging out the suffering? everywhere i look i see fake people, narcissism, delusions of grandeur, masked contempt amp hate, jealousy, lies, backstabbers, power hungry bullies, and criminals and you know what? they win. over and over and over and over again i see and encounter individuals who really are despicable in their acts, deeds, and merits, and yet they are winning, happier than me, wealthier than me, with friends and adoring folk around them, even the ones they tread on daily. so this world is a nightmare illusion, where evil triumphs and there is no real justice. the more fake you are, the more you make it and damnit, that is just not me. i am tired of it. it is enough. i am not brave enough to end my life, but i wish daily for it to end. now with all the fear mongering about coronavirus, i am hoping to get it. i look back at my life, and i look at my life, and i wish there was a delete button for it. i am pathetic, and i am ok with it now, life is pathetic and i see it as pointless. i could write more, but what is the point?	moderate

medication works!!! i have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and i have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. it really helps! a little background i got out of a year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in december . and then one person who i thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. i get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression which eventually led to insomnia, ibs, migraines and constant body aches. i started therapy in feb and have been since going to my therapist every week. and my therapist suggested i look at options for medication and try it. so since the last weeks, i am on lexapro ssri and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. but for the last days i have been observing that my energy levels have increased because i have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. my ibs has decreased and i have not got any migraines. i am really really glad the medication is helping. if anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it. i am sure if it working and it will help.	not depression

what is there left to life for first offi amsorry for my englishi amdrunk. il begin where it all started. when i was years old my back then girlfriend who i was really in love with killed herself by hanging herself and i have ptsd since that. i was in contact with a couple of therapists but i dont think they can help me. when i was around i found another girl who at the time reminded me of myself and i fall in love with her. we had been together for years but i started to threat her badly at the end i dont know why i did this but i did. she became clincal depressed because of me and i could not see me as the reason behind it. she left me around a year ago. i have to say about that that i have extrem social anxiety and dont leave my appartment at any time only in the mornin at around am when i have to buy food. my mental state since that has became worse and worse. i started taking drugs and drink alkohol on a daily basis because i can not deal with being responsible for her state. a couple months ago i started to cut myself and had suicide attempts by taking painkillers the first time and around the second time. right now i am back home from a long walk thinking about jumping infront of a train. i work a deadend job in a office where everyone makes fun of me on a daily basis and i have to pretend that everything is fine or else they fire me because i used to almost get violent against my coworkers when they started to tell me i do this for attention and that there is nothing wrong with me. every single day of my life is constant agony i wish i would just die. my daily life outside of work consist of playing games and taking drugs getting high to keep me thistracted. on a weekend i spend around hours a day on my pc watching series from my childhood and while thinking of better times. i dont know why i really write this shit here but i feel like theres nothing else i can do. i am sry for bothering all of you.	moderate
i dont want to be a burden. i like this girl. she seems to like me, i am no expert. she has seen bits of my problems, i dont try to hide them. i wish i could be with her but i will just make her life worse. sure she might feel good at first but i will only drag her down in the end. she deserves someone who makes her see the good things not someone she has to babysit. i wish i wasnt like this 	not depression

i have to go back on a higher dose and i hate admitting it a couple months ago, i talked with my doctor about going on a lower dose of my antidepressant because it was affecting my memory and sleep so we thought my wife and i made jokes that i was on such a high dosage, i was basically on horse tranquilizers. two months ago, i went on a lower dose and everything was fine. i just took less and did not feel worse or better. maybe a little less sluggish and my memory was a bit better i had troubles remembering some stuff . the last two months have been great except for the last couple weeks. it started with more worry. i started thinking and stressing about is everything okay? is my relationship in a good place? is my wife happy? am i doing everything i can at work? why can not i do better in general? i shrugged it off just being regular stresses and took this holiday season to just relax and enjoy. it was going fine, but still i had nagging stresses and felt myself going into a bigger and bigger hole every time something not ideal happened. i would be down for hours afterwards and i was not about to admit to myself or my wife that i was not doing well. i pushed so hard to be okay that a couple days ago, something very trivial happened where i took it to heart and a few days later, it was all i could think about when i was about to go to sleep, going to the movies, with friends or family. i have come to the conclusion that i need to go back up a little on my dosage like i was before. my depression is back. my doctor said if i started feeling it, i should go back up to the old dosage. a pill instead of a i feel like a failure. my depression is still there and i can not beat it without medication. my sleep is still the same on both dosages. my memory will get worse possibly. maybe my methods i have built in remembering will help and i can not fall back into forgetting things. but i would rather be forgetful than frustrated, sad, angry, and overall unpleasant to be with the past couple weeks. i am not suicidal at all, i am not wanting to harm myself, i am just sad and it is affecting my overall happiness in life and it is causing strain on my relationships. i am waiting for my wife to come home to talk to her about it and i know she is going to be supportive, but i am in such a hole that i feel like she would not be. i am so in my head. can i get some support? p.s. if i do show my wife this, and now she is reading this, i am sorry for the past couple weeks of shit. i love you and my depression is no indicator how happy and in love i am with you. you are my best friend and you did not do anything wrong. i know this is hard for you to fully understand, so, thank you for your love and support always 	severe
my first reddit post i do not know what is wrong with me. i am not able to pin point. its this everlasting mopey feeling that just manages to ruin my whole day every single day. hey all, i am an international student studying film in the us. i recently graduated in december a semester before my class. i am on my opt period under which i can stay in this country for more year if i get a job. i moved out of my roommates place in august . i decided to live alone. idk why i made that decision, but my life has been miserable since then. all the devilish thoughts, all my anger, self hatred, this thisgusting lonely feeling all of these emotions that i had managed to suppress for years, just started spewing out. for the first few days it was just in small batches that i would feel horrible, but later it became every days or days kinda thing. i am going to skip ahead in time and tell you how i feel now. i feel like doing nothing. i am a filmmaker, i used to love writing and making films. i do not even know what i want to do anymore. i just sit around not being able to make a single successful decision in time. not getting a job has really messed with my self image issues. i do not like looking at myself sometimes. i feel very alone. i stay locked up in my apartment for the whole day. i smoke weed and that makes me calm down a little. but now, idk if that is even a thing or just me trying to placebo my own self. i recently googled do i have depression . my phone seems to think i have depression, i need to get help. but i do not know how. i do not know if i have depression or is it just me trying to find a reason why i am not good enough to get a job anymore. this little college student needs some guidance.	moderate

struggling for over a month now and the end seems no where near. you know how it goes. i do not even have the energy to really explain. everyday i say tomorrow will be better. woke up at pm today but got over hours of sleep, of course that makes me feel even more like shit. i have the most insane vivid dreams lately it gets really heard to wake up from them. the house is not bad but it could be a lot better. i do not have anything to say to anyone and i can not bring myself to do the things i love. i guess i am just looking for some words of encouragement or understanding. always makes me feel a bit better knowing i am not alone in this feeling. sorry if this was not very coherent thoughts, i have no energy to write out what i am really thinking.	moderate
first official post well today i went for my first initial evaluation with a specialized psychiatrist since i was a kid i am . i mean i went to my university is student health and saw the psychiatrist there and got therapy through the psych service at school. but this was my first seeing one not through a school. the kind with the leather couch and had classical music playing. anyway, i was not nervous like i said university blah blah blah. i went in confident just had to do the pre eval and just get my meds filled there. well that is not what happened. after an hour he sits back and i ask him how i am looking. he said that he wanted to recommend inpatient. that was the first shock. idk why it was a shock i just never thought i needed it the second was after i told him about visual and auditory hallucinations which i thought was normal because uni doc did not seemed phased . he told me he would right up a report but that i may have psychotic depression. now it may not seem like a big change from just having major depression thisorder, but idk. am i overreacting? probably. i am just tired now, i feel like everything that with depression would i am just to lazy to type. i feel awful because my family cares and is supporting me and is doing everything they can. but i am not fixed. i feel like i am just a lost cause. sorry for bumming anyone out.	severe
therapy i have been having some adverse reactions towards my therapist lately. in december we took a break from our relationship because we both had things to do. when i came back i was really anxious. i had never been so anxious seeing her. i thought that the anxiety would go away but it always come back. whether i call to schedule an appointment with her, think about my appointment with her the night before my appointment, or while waiting for my appointment in the lobby, during our sessions and after my anxiety ramps up. my last session with her my voice was shaking. she told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. i do not really know where this is coming from. i was expecting the anxiety to go away by now. i become so anxious that others notice at work and that i become nauseous. maybe it is the fear that the relationship could work out or maybe it is the fear that it would not work out. i kind of just use her as a sounding board at the moment. it bothers me to my core that i have to pay someone just to listen to me because i have been quiet for too long. the things that she tells me are basic. we have tried meditation but i had this fear that she was going to rob me. we tried book work but we both became thistracted and now we do not know where to start with that. we practice assertiveness and i am doing okay with that. sometimes i do not think that i need her and that i am wasting my money. sometimes i think it would be better if i just said that it is not working out.	severe
get off social media. i mean now. edited . social media is not about you. it is about other people. it is about companies making money from your identity. it is not a place for recovery, it is often a place for torment. why not try it for a week? turn off facebook. turn off instagram. turn off snapchat. turn it all off. the ones who love you, the ones who will actually aide you in your recovery will call. much love, a person like you with depression.	not depression
a comprehensive guide on slowly getting better, and not losing hope. in no way am i an expert, and in no way have i mastered these points, but i have had depression for about years now, and i have seen what works and what does not, and i wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but i believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub. i write this because it makes me feel better, and because i like to help other people. it makes me less depressed. if someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, i will be happy and grateful for it. being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves. in no way are these ordered from most important to least. in no way am i suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self hatred. i do not see hope for myself, but i believe in it regardless. i hope you can too. exercise daily do something you like. it does not have to be the most intense, fat burning, crazy workout. all i am saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. try out the gym for a couple months, aiming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. try going and being active a couple times a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. it can be anything from karate to chess trust me, this actually burns a significan not amount of calories! , from swimming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a shaolin monk eat healthy we always hear this one, and for good reason! it is simple, but it gets hard, does not it? we want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. i am not saying pizza is off the table forever, but i am saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! contrary to popular belief, healthy food can taste good. many depressed people have low levels of vitamin d like me so i take those regularly alongside some magnesium supplements. i believe overtime this will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical imbalance a different way. take meds if you need them talk to someone. if they suggest pills, try them out. i have had pills that swung me the right way lexapro , and i have had pills that swung me a very, very bad way some green looking pill, i do not remember what it was but i hated it dude . everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. just... try it. i know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pills for depression and taking pills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. not a cure, but a step. journal this is a big one for me. i have kept up journaling ever since i was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. writing things down like this has a way of soothing the soul, i think. write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy hopefully at some point. clean your room i suck at this, but there is something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. you ll feel better, trust me. read this is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but i do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. no, not a book that you hope will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. read matilda for all i care! i read that book in one toilet session and i felt great the rest of the day. go outside once a day all i am saying is minutes. at least. you can manage that. there are days where i self isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the funk it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. just do something. general hygiene big one. this is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. you ll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, trim your beard, de odor yourself, whatever! you ll feel slightly better if you look and smell better. sleep well i am talking hours at night and not throughout the day. do not waste the day away by taking little naps all the time. do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. you will feel better. you would not be cured, but you ll feel better. your body needs this, friend. wake up early again, this might not be for everyone as a matter of fact, who is it for really , but trust me when i say that almost every time i wake up early and do some stuff i like, the rest of the day feels better because i did something productive at the start of it. i get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it is great! be wise with money i know, many people may not agree with me here. i fail in this aspect a lot, so i am not saying i am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but i am telling you guys that life is better without it. i went a year without it once, and seriously it made a huge difference. i believe that we can love our fellow humans better without porn or masturbation. you may thisagree, but i stay by this conviction. compliment people, spread positivity, without expecting anything in return this is a great one. even if you do not believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. here is the catch do not do it for your own gain. do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. you want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise. do not stay in your house or room for too long poor timing on this one, i know. but go for a walk or something this comes at an awkward timing, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. my worst days are when i am just scrolling reddit or pornhub or facebook and when i am just... wasting myself away. get out of your room, be productive, do something. serve other people in some way this is a bit different from complimenting people, but the premise is the same. help others. join a non profit organization and help out once a week. you meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. there is nothing like it! you are doing something amazing, even if it is small. you are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. this could really change your life, as it has mine. get together with friends get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. whether it is at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, anything. just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. this may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago and all of high school too , but try it out. the right people will come, i am sure of it. call family whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. it has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, thisconnection, abuse anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. but sometimes you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other. listen to music duh! we all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. for me it is coldplay and a little known artist named chris renzema. they have been with me through ups and downs lots of downs . i also listen to william augusto instrumentals as i fall asleep each night. very helpful. try out therapy for a couple months it can be scary, i know. and for me personally therapy did not even fully work out for me. but this does not mean i did not try it. i tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because i did not feel any differently. this would not be the same for everyone. at least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend. limit screen time if you can help it less time on the phone, less time on the computer, less time on the tv. all great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? find a schedule that works for you. i personally am trying to lower my screentime on my phone to hours a day, and eventually to hours. small goals, one step at a time. make daily to do lists most days, in the morning or the day before, i create a to do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. i even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what i accomplished and so i can put a little checkmark besides it! take care of a pet i recently got a bearded dragon his name is henry , and it has given me something new to live for and protect. as someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. send me pictures of them so i can tell you how cute they are. be in nature i believe this is for everyone. get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. try to travel to a national park at some point, and take in the sights. go for a short hike and look at the trees. we are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it. nofap, noporn i know, many people may not agree with me here. i fail in this aspect alot, so i am not saying i am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but i am telling you guys that life is better without it. i went a year without it once, and seriously it made a huge difference. i believe that we can love our fellow humans better without porn or masturbation. you may thisagree, but i stay by this conviction. practice gratitude stay thankful for the things that you have. whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. again, i do this too, so let us get better together. now, i am a devout protestant christian, and i wanted to include my christian side to this equation. this is the most important part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason i am still alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step. pray for others and yourself read the bible this is the thing upon which we compare everything else. this is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the lord speaks to his people through his word. learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the one who loves us. meditate christians meditate too! take time in silence and align yourself with the holy spirit, as he speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth. get together with church community listen to worship take time alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in jesus name, or are still depressed this side of eternity and are still trusting in the direction of the one who gave it all for them. hope, my friends. hope. take steps to better yourself. give yourself grace. keep trying. hope, my friends. hope. 	not depression

peculiar situation i have been in for a while i used to have many goals and want many things out of life love, friends, to have a career with some artistic body of work and that was when i felt most violently suicidally depressed. now i really do not have any goals or want anything but the well being of my cats, which they have. i now have no desire for friends, love, or to create and be a success. it does not even feel like depression because i do not really feel anything at all not bad and not good. i just feel normal, or what has been normal to me for some years now but when i take time to get introspective about like right now i have to admit it is objectively hollow. my head feels empty and every now and then i realize that i have not thought about my own life in days, just politics and shit. i feel like i have failed to capture the crux of what i wanted to say here but yeah ultimately i have been in a hollow empty unfeeling form of depression for some years now where i just coast and do not want anything and feel nothing. i relate to people less and less everyday and i realize that is objectively bad. and like i said, it does not even feel like depression because it is not depression as i knew it before where i felt a constant pain because i wanted certain things that i did not have. it, to me, feels like at some point i just gave up and settled in the hopelessness	moderate
i feel ok for now. it is been a very long time that i have felt like i did not deserve nor want to be here. just about everyday for months negative thoughts made me want to just slit my wrists or drive into a tree or underpass. just something to take myself out of this world or hurt myself because i feel like i deserve these types of things to happen to me. today was the first day that i did not have nearly as many thoughts like that and i had more energy to do simple things like shower or go to the store.i amglad today was a better day than usual, but i am just scared because i know when i feel any type of happiness or contentment, the next day or so things get worse than before and i get slammed back to the depths of depression. it is just about to the point where i do not want to be happy anymore because it is just a trick. i get my hopes up in thinking i am going to be alright, but i know i am just going to spiral and it will be worse than before. anyways, i did not mean for the post to be this long, just thought i would let you all know today was an alright day for me and hopefully tomorrow will be the same. 	moderate

i am struggling to help my depressed friend... i am really trying but they constantly berate and lash out at me i am at the end of my tether, so i would really appreciate some advice please. a friend of mine who i have known for nearly years had a bit of a bad turn in the past two years. he is based in one country, and i f, currently live halfway across the world. he is what you would consider friends who are family . or least i thought so. lately, i am finding it very difficult to deal with him, and i feel that i should cut him out of my life. a summary of his situation . his marriage fell through a couple of years ago. his decision. he has one young child bit of a mess, he broke up with her whilst she was pregnant, something i never agreed with . they were having problems for years he claims she is the reason for many of his mental health issues. . since then he has gone from not drinking to drinking regularly. sleeping around, making friends with weird people etc . it reached a stage where last year he was talking to me about suicide, and how he has planned his death several times. he talks about how no one in his life is there for him mum, dad, ex wife, sister . . now he has fallen into trouble with the law, accused of something pretty serious. i have no doubt in my mind he is innocent despite the changes of the past few years , so that is not even a question. just to add context to his background, he is educated to doctorate level, intelligent and has a good job he is currently suspended until police make a decision whether to charge him and has never been in trouble with the law before. the issues i encounter . at the best of times, he is quite insensitive in the way he deals with people. he can be quite cutting with his words at times, and i feel in the past, he has not been there for me when i needed him the most a couple of situations . that being said, he was married, in a different country...etc. so i kind of get it. people get busy with life. . because of a childhood complex, he does not like people giving him advice. so even when you try to have a conversation with him, and offer some solutions, he lashes out about it and gets angry. . i have recommended therapy because i know how much it helps. he says he has been, but was never given any medication he is not sure if he wants to take meds , and since the one time he went, he has not said anything else about it. tbh, i do not think he even went back. . more recently with this trouble with the law situation... he would send messages like i am going to be charged... i just know it. i am going to lose my child. i have no faith in the justice system. i can not go to prison. if i am charged, that is it i am ending my life. . i personally feel he is not taking enough action. he is not speaking to many lawyers, for instance. he is with one lawyer who does not seem to be doing much. he comes across as being very indifferent about the whole process. he asks me what i would do if i am in his position. i tell him. his response? you do not think i have not thought of that? you think i am just sitting there doing nothing? you think you re all high and mighty. i have never been in trouble with the law. i am so scared. i have no idea what to do or how anything works. etc. i ask him if he trusts the lawyer he is with. he says i do not know how do i even figure that out? . after his latest outburst, i told him to get his act together and enough with the victim mentality. in hindsight, my choice of words were not great but there is only so much i can take. i attempted to explain to him that the concept of victim mentality also applies to genuine victims i had spoke to this with my therapist before , i never once implied he was faking it, but in order for an individual to create change they have to leave the victim mentality and go into survival mode. to me, he is being defeatist right now when he needs to fight to clear his name. no one in the world can do something like that for you but yourself. it is what i would do personally. . he responded by saying he thought i was a thisgusting human being and an insensitive prick . and for the past hours has latched on the words victim mentality when i fully explained what my point was. he then proceeded to say no matter how many times i tell you, i have no idea what is going on. you re just assuming i am sat at home being defeatist. earlier, he made a reference about how i have always butted in about his life. the funny thing is... it has always been him coming to me with the problems. i even went through old emails today to make sure i am not going crazy. what do i do? i am tired. i feel i am his emotional punchbag. despite him calling me thisgusting, i am trying to be there with support just for the sake of his child. every time he has gotten angry accusing me of having no idea what is going on, i have reminded him that i am not in his environment. i am not in the middle of it all, therefore i just go by what he is telling me from halfway across the world. which is usually not much. he is the one who usually initiates conversation with messages like i know i am going to jail. i just know it. i try my best to be there and listen, whilst trying to offer some hope. i have offered financial support for legal fees. i have offered to talk to lawyers i know. i have offered friends who are connected to law. he has not taken any of my offers. he complains about advice given to him. then asks me what i would do if i were in his position. i answer, and then he gets angry at me. you know that feeling of that you can not win, no matter what? i do not know what he wants, and i do not know how to help him. i have had my own mental health issues, but it is in my personality is just to own it and do something about it. i made myself go to a psychiatrist i took the medication i made myself go to a therapist. i strongly believe that no one in the world can help you but you you need to be the one to take action to save your soul. not everyone is the same, i understand that. but this is not helping my own mental health. i have never wanted anything from my friendships, but it does not feel good to absorb this much negativity on a delay basis. it does affect me. his words can be immensely hurtful at times. i understand that this might be due to what he is going through, but there is only so much i can take before i am at breaking point. i apologise for this being a long read, but i wanted to offer as much background as possible. i am hoping i can connect with someone who could give me advice on what to do in this situation. thank you.	not depression

tw drug use, overdose, death last night i got a call from my dad telling me my sister was at the hospital, after she found her fiance dead in their bathtub from an overdose. he had been clean for three years, and was so fucking proud of himself. we have no idea how long hes been using again, but when i was doing a sweep of his basement, i found a pipe, needles one loaded and three baggies. i used to use, but ive been clean for months now. i always thought if he could do it so could i. but that is not the point i guess. i told my sister she shouldnt worry about it, i kept an eye on him. i checked his arms and legs when he wasnt looking. i talked to him atleast once a week. fuck i saw him earlier yesterday, and i couldnt fucking tell. i told her repeatedly that he wasnt using, cause i would be able to tell if he had been. i put it on everything that he wasnt using. i went to bat for him on a hundred different occasions. hes the closest thing ive ever had to a brother, and because i was so sure of myself i told them not to worry about it. i shouldve been able to see the signs.	moderate
tears are all i have left well, i am about to go to work, and it is time to cry in order to be able to cope through the shift and not show anyone my inner pain and appear happy. crying has become my only solace in life. i love crying. it is like a prayer to god and a way of hugging myself. it is like my soul finally being able to breath and speak. it is all i have that comforts me. no one knows me or sees me or understands me for who i am. no one comprehends the pain i have gone through and continue to go through everyday. i help others all the time and show love and compassion. who will help or save me now? people are so judgemental. why can not we just love one another and do what is right and avoid what is wrong? people are so proud they do not see anyone who suffers and they treat others like dirt. we are all gods children right? why can not we have compassion for one another and stop abusing each other, mocking others and being cruel? anyways, just wanted to write that.	moderate
i am at a crossroad... i am a year old male. i have been suffering from anxiety and periodic panic attacks for years. although i seem like a happy genuine and likeable guy on the surface i have been fighting with anxiety and panic below the surface. like a duck who seems to float peacefully on the surface on the water but is kicking below the surface of the water just to prevent itself from sinking. months ago i decided to just stop resisting the panic and anxiety and just let is wash over me. i am tired of fighting, there is no more energy left. for years i have been trying to look at life from a bright perspective but i can not do it anymore. ever since that decision months ago a feeling of depression crawling over me. for the past week these waves of depression and hopelessness came up so strong that i feel like i am thisassociating i can only lie down and undergo the feeling, like i am smothered by dread and terror. for the past days or so i have been entertaining the thought of suicide. i do not see a way out of this, and if this will be the quality of my life for the rest of my life i do not feel like riding it out. i still have grams of cocaine yeah... do not ask me why... which i have considered thissolving into a glass of water and drink all at once. on the one hand i feel that i should not do it but on the other hand the feeling of dread and terror are so goddamn intense that i just do not care anymore.	moderate
kids and depression mental illness i am desperate for advice on how to explain to my year old son what depression is. i actually have bipolar thisorder but do not even know where i would start with that one. my son gets very angry with me. he thinks i choose to be feel this way and says just stop being sad be happy how easy is that?! i know i can not be upset with him for not understanding, but i am also extremely frustrated about it. he says it is embarrassing to have a mom with depression. that just hurts me even more. he went from having a happy, energetic, spunky, fun, thrill seeking, supportive mom to one who lays in bed all the time, is constantly fatigued, has migraines constantly, no patience, never wants to do anything, cries a lot, etc. i feel like he is grieving me. i grieve myself, so i can understand. but he can not. he thinks i am just being selfish, lazy, mean, etc. i looked on google for some ideas but did not find anything that i felt like going with. i have tried many times to explain it from my perspective, but he just can not comprehend what i am saying. i am lost, and it is making me feel even worse. please, if anyone has anything helpful i would greatly appreciate it!!!	severe

have not left the house in two months...but i am sick, again. i was just laying in bed attempting to sleep, and am unable to because i am so focused on a dry scratchiness in the back of my throat. i can not think of a time where i have felt this kind of feeling and it was not a precursor to me getting sick. i have been feeling off and weak all day, but i go through a lot of drops in energy so i did not think anything of it. i just had the flu a few weeks ago. so twice within a two month period where i did not even leave the house i am getting sick. i bitch a lot, i feel my life is unfair a lot, but this is utterly unfair. i am used to getting sick about once every three years and it is usually mild, twice in two months is unheard of for me. naturally i have to wonder if it is the coronavirus, i saw news that it is here in my city. two months in isolation has burned through my food stores, i am pretty much down to canned beets and peas at this point. going to be a rough ride if i am getting sick as i expect. i am already struggling to make rent, i really can not be taken out of commission right now.	moderate
i feel like i can not get anything out. for about the last or so years, i have slipped in and out of depression. it kind of started midway through high school, about the time i was starting to think about college. i have two older siblings, one, my brother, years older, the other, my sister, years older. around the end of my sophomore year, my brother sat down with me in my room and we hung out, and he told me about how he kind of got depressed in high school, and that he didnt want the same to happen to me. it hit me really hard, and i tried, but i could not stop it. winter of junior year was probably the hardest, as it was the most i ever thought about suicide went to a bridge over a frozen river and sat on the edge for a while thinking about whether anyone would give a shit. i am depressed, but i always feel like if i try to talk to ppl about it, i am just seeking attention, so i dont.	moderate

do not give up. depression is hard. it is unseen, unheard, yet it is there like a dark veil covering you all the time. i was in a very dark place. my grandmother and grandfather passed away shortly after each other and then the girl i had been with for years cheated on me and left me with an appartment i couldnt afford getting me into debt. and then my aunt got cancer to make matters worse. i barely had energy to get out of bed, let alone get up and go to work for a very shabby paycheck. but i kept getting up, and went to work. stayed extra hours if i didnt make enough yet to pay my rent. i was on autopilot like this for a long time, just barely going by my day to day life. social contact was getting less and less too. i didnt reach out and eventually people stopped reaching out too. i started smoking weed and started drinking a lot. gained a lot of weight because of it and an unhealthy diet of fastfood, but didnt care. all the things i liked doing before, gaming, football, chilling with friends, became boring. everything was boring. i often had thoughts of just ending it, but didnt want to do that to my mom who always tried to help. so i just kept going like i was. then one day i just decided i had enough, yes the going had been rough, but i wouldnt let it get me down. i started working out and getting in touch with friends i had lost contact with. and started looking for a job that had a better pay to get out of my debts. i found that job through a friend i reached out to again and got out of my debts. now i still have some dark days, but they are far less common then before. and i feel like it is all getting a bit better slowly, but surely. i understand this will not help everyone, and not everyone can just flip a switch one day and say enough is enough, it is not that easy, all i am saying is do not give up. that change could come someday. it could be something inside yourself, or maybe something you witness happen. a song, a movie, anything. just dont give up. one day it might get better. but it definitely will not if you give up.	moderate
what it do, why is this. so i have grown up with parents who were not a good pair. they fought a lot and screamed at each other my whole growing up. it came to the point my mom would leave tinge house and my dad wouldn t let her. i would have to follow them outside and force my dad to stop holding the car door on my mom. pulling him off with all my muscle. he stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. i get very anxious and uncomfortable . sometimes get nauseous. why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what. it does not affect me that bad and no one has noticed so it does not affect me too bad. thanks 	severe

 idk if i have depression, tbh. all i know is i am worthless, useless, stupid, fat, and unpredictable. i think this all started when i just shower everyone with trust and love. let me tell you something about myself. i was jolly, quirky, playful, and silly when i was a kid. i am friends with everybody in the class. back to the story.. i met my childhood ex best friend back in th grade. were so close that no one could ever separate us. you d see us having lunches together, have tutoring sessions together, playing together, and everything that normal child besties do. but everything changed when we met our rd best friend. they started to hang out much more, leaving me behind but i did not mind cus hey, i am glad that we have more friends to do everything with. all went well until th grade. my ex best friend started to get thistant like she would always try to avoid talking to me, having eye contact, or even sitting next to me. i got really sad that time. what did i do to make her avoid me? and that lasted for months. time passes by and graduation was approaching. we had a little kick off party for the whole class. i was a bit hesitant on attending the party bc i was just not in the mood for anything but i went anyways. not bc the teacher said everyone should go but bc my mom told me to spend the last day of school with my friends . so i did. and that was not pleasing at all. when i arrived in school my other friends immediately asked me if i was going to my ex best friend s pool party the day after graduation. of course i did not know about this so called pool party my best friend will held for her friends . so they were shocked as i am. one friend stood up and told me something about me and my best friend is rd best friend from th grade. she told me that she is been bad mouthing me from the very beginning. j just fell totally silent at that moment ad my world began crumbling into pieces. fast forward, graduation was over and time for high school. i was still down the whole summer and i wanted to get away from people i knew bc i would think that they were all gossiping fallacies about me. so i decided, no. i want to go to a new school for a change of environment. but it was not what i expected to be. i had a hard time making new friends and with a span of days, i quitted that school. then my mom moved me to a high school in our town where all of my elementary classmates were. luckily, they were based on the science oriented classes. and i was enrolled to an arts based curriculum. everyone was nice to me and i started to gain confidence again. until a group of friends bullied me for years. so i found refuge in food. i began to eat a lot when i get sad, or happy. all was fine until i gained weight and my body was not pleasing to look at anymore. and guess what, those bullies started to pick on my body a lot more. they would be shouting walk faster, fatso. you re blocking our way and shits like that. so, i started to eat less thinking that if i would be skinnier, everyone would like me. years went by and i did lost a couple of pounds. i found myself happy again. now, during my teenage years, my father would always have something to say to every action i make. idk why but i just thought maybe he is just tired from work. so i let it slide. but on december , my crumpled up world burned into ashes. my father and i were sitting on the bench in the mall, waiting for mom to finish in the public restroom. he was complaining to me about the agency he was working at, so i just listened and told him that it is going to be fine. but then he uttered, i wish i had not build this family too early. that made me stopped listening to him and those words kept repeating inside my head. so he regretted having us? having me? or this family? like wth? we were a mistake? is that why he is always hot headed with me? shit happened and i could not take everything they were throwing at me. the pain was unbearable to the point where i would shiver every night while crying. sometimes, i would just contemplate whether to take my own life or not. but then i thought of my mother. i wanted to give her a better life and make her smile more. i do not want to leave her first because that would crush her. so what i do is sometimes, i would just grab the nearest sharpest object and cut my wrists. it was painful but it was good. it is so addicting that everytime the pain was too extreme i would do it again and again and again and again until i can feel the pain on my wrists, not the one in my chest.	severe

i am a mess right now i have no one to listen to my problems so i thought i would write them down. then i decided to post it on here. just moved to a new city and started at a new school. i do not miss anything from my old hometown, i am actually quite happy to be somewhere else. moving has been tough though. i had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends. i have kind of joined a group of friends at school. they are all pretty nice. the dynamic of the group is a little weird though. its like introverts who do not talk much, myself included, and strongly opinionated extroverts. they mostly seem like a nice group of people though. in regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. it is hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. i feel like i am being ungrateful because even though i think i have been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what i want, i still feel so shit. i have never been diagnosed but i think i could have depression and or anxiety. i would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but i do not want to tell my parents how i feel. over the past few years i have thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. i have been thinking about it a lot recently. i have been researching pills i can get at a chemist that i could overdose on and i have found a suicide bridge that is very close to my house. i have been told that i should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments does not seem worth it sometimes. i am starting to find it hard to trust myself. i am like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. during the brief moments when i feel happy about something i worry about my emotions causing me to do something i regret. when i am sad or empty it is all i can think about. there is this girl who is not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. she seems like a really nice person. we do not see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. i am unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it is making me dizzy. i really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but i am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake i make. i feel kind of like it will never happen, yet i spent the whole afternoon texting her. i feel like i am going insane. the people i admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you re always left wanting more from them. i aspire to be like this and make other people happy. i need to remember to smile more though. usually i have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non existent. a month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and has not changed much, i think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. i just started waking up at am every morning out of nowhere and i can not stop. i do not know what the fuck is happening to me. i feel so lonely. i just want someone to talk to and listen to. getting to that point with someone new takes time and i am getting kind of impatient. i do not know what to do to make myself happy. if things worked out with this girl i think i would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful. wow, this ended up really long.	moderate
easier to lie i am exhausted from telling the truth. telling what i really feel and what i am going through. how difficult it is. how lonely it is sometime. i keep telling myself that sharing to those who i trust is a good thing but it is not. all those words, promises, from others are just lies. they will forget their own words and will just hurt you again and again. i know everyone is tired. i know everyone is stressed. how is it that i can not feel tired when everyone can? i did not ask for this kind of mental state. i did not want to be in this mental state. i guess it is easier to lie saying i am fine, or making myself look happy. it is easier to fake your happiness than to be truthful of what pains you. i have probably vented too much on this subreddit and i think i should just keep myself quiet from now on. it is difficult and probably impossible but i really do hope everyone of you will have a good day, one day.	moderate
depression in a relationship i am in a year relationship with my girlfriend and i have been suffering with depression since i was a teenager. my depression has gone pretty bad and frequently lately and it shows in our relationship. my girlfriend knows i have been suffering for this for awhile but sometimes she does not understand how to handle my state because she never had any experience before which i do not blame her. for the past year, we been in fights and our communication has been good lately. we tried to talk things out but when we do, my depression would kick in because i felt so bad about myself and our relationship. i feel most of the time my depression comes from our relationship. i dont know if i should break up with my girlfriend. i still love her but i feel she is getting frustrated with trying to help me. our relationship is becoming unheathly. sometimes i feel if we were to break up, we wouldn t put the pressure on each other anymore.	moderate
where to go from here i have been battling depression for almost years. some days are better than other but for the past year it feels like it is getting worse by the day. i recently did something i now vary much regret. i helped my closest friend break into a veterinarian office to steal drugs ketamine . i did not think he would do it but now i have to pay the price. i should have told him no. i did not say no because he is the closest thing i have to a friend these days. this feels like rock bottom but every time i think it is rock bottom it is not. where do i go from here?	moderate

just venting...just hit me other year olds are going to college, having sex, having fun with friends, and enjoying living, meanwhile my life has gotten so bad i think i will be dead any day. i have always been a depressed loser. never had any friends. assumed things would improved as i aged into my s but my life has become a living nightmare. i spend all day everyday in bed after quitting my nightmare job due to severe anxiety. i abuse alcohol severely. i am paranoid every day i am going to be dead from heart kidney liver failure. i have such bad fatigue. i do not remember the last time i was not tired. i just can not believe my life has become this. i have nothing. i used to think i was a loser when i was teenager because i didnt have friends and all i did was play videogames. there was a small period of time when i was where i was in shape and i felt good about myself. but now i literally am a loser. i have ballooned up to pounds from and i am going to be dead by . i do not want to die. i know life has good things to offer. i just wish i could obtain them.	moderate
just an advice watch after life on netflix. story of a man played by ricky gervais who lost his beloved wife and just wants to kill himself. it does not solve your problems, but makes you think. at least it made me think. it is a short series, very funny but also deep. maybe let me know if you watched it or ever going to watch 	not depression
do not remember what its like to feel normal help my sister passed away last summer from what we originally believed to be a suicide but later found out to be from pneumonia, and about a month later my girlfriend of over years broke up with me. since then i though i was fine but now its about months later andi amreally struggling. i can not go to sleep at night, i get anxious thoughts and a couple times right before i have gone to sleep i have heard a voice in my head that is not my concious or gotten an intense rush of fear that has kept me up. when i do get to sleep i can not get out of bed in the morning. one sunday i physically got sick of the feeling of having to go to my internship in the morning and started crying for no reason so i had to quit. when its time for me to go to class i can not bring myself to go. i had a . gpa my first two years of college and this year i failed a class and have no motivation to do well anymore. it feels like everydayi amjust trying to make it to the next. the only thing i have been doing consistently is going to the gym but it seems to not have helped much. sometimes i wonder what it would be like if i just passed away in my sleep, not seriously considering harming myself but it feels like my life is just in a hole i can not get out of.	moderate
is this depression? recently i was broken up with for no obvious reason other than the fact that i did not do enough. i am in a ton of debt for school, work is so horrible i never show up and they refuse to fire me. all i want to do is smoke weed and smoke more weed and not want to do anything. my friends invite me to go do things with them and i do but i do not enjoy myself. talking about my problems does help but only temporarily and i always find my way back to square one. i have lost all motivation for school and work, i have dropped all my hobbies. i have never experienced such a drastic change in my personality before until recently and i do not know what to do about it.	moderate

can not cope with this anymore nothing feels right and i do not know what to do anymore. nothing makes me feel alive anymore. i just recently broke up with the person who i wanted to spend my life with. he left me. before he left me i was already in a dark place but now i am alone as well. i have fallen back into unhealthy coping mechanisms. i have had meaningless sex, resorted to drinking. i have seriously contemplated self harming again i used to have a severe issue with it but have been clean for years. . i have even contemplated suicide. i feel like i do not deserve to be alive. the world would be better without me. i feel so guilty about meaningless sex, it eats me up inside and i hate myself for it. i fucking hate myself for it. i try to stop but it does not work. i think i have a serious issue as using sex as a coping mechanism and i hate myself for it. last time i used it as a coping mechanism i was sexually assaulted a few times. now i want to stop but the last time i felt this horrible was after i was assaulted. i want all this to end. i can not fucking live like this anymore	moderate
if you have depression and you do not kill yourself, you will theoretically feel a little better every day because you have to live less i thought about this while i was watching bojack horseman. i feel like it could help someone because i think this thought helps me too atleast a little bit.	moderate

it is been five months and i still cry when people talk about my ex i have been in a dark place for over a year and it does not help that i am a pathetic piece of shit who still cries over my ex gf after five months. i have not been with anyone since while she is already been with new guys, it really comes of that she did not care as much as i thought she did which is such a kick in the teeth. she was the only one i trusted with my cutting and after we ended she told my parents about it which i told her not to do. and since then i have gone through the hoops to get professional help and it is been a slow slow that anyone that knows the uk healthcare system will know. i am finally having my first camhs appointment on tuesday and it is going to be a slow process with the whole covid thing. but i just feel so unwanted. and crippling loneliness and anxiety does not help the whole not getting over the ex thing. suicide attempts do not help either hahaha. i hate myself so much. i just want to curl up and die too. or just a nice girl who loves me for me and does not see me as a pathetic over emotional piece of shit. i am sorry for this whiny post i just needed somewhere to rant...	not depression
i love my kid i love my kid but she triggered me so much today. i am driving home from work and i can not help but think that i have years until she is grown and i do not have to protect her anymore. this means that i can finally follow through with my suicide. i am really depressed and suicidal but i have to push through for her. i was woken up by her throwing a tantrum and saying she wished she was dead because she wants to play her device... it makes me mad because she has no idea of how much i struggle with this on a daily basis and she uses this in a tantrum to get her way. more years and i can finally give up	not depression

the child who is not loved by the village will burn it down to feel it is warmth we are all here because nobody loves us. some of us turn completely sad and null, others are constantly pissed and only see red. there is also a group that belongs to both. when you can only feel either sadness or anger. there seems to be a notion that depression is not a real problem. the truth is it is an unavoidable block in someone is mind. the block turns into a cloud, the cloud envelopes your soul, and you are now coated and consumed by sadness. we re not deep thinkers, we re not smart people, we re just losers. we want to feel loved.	not depression

i have been extremely depressed for the past year and the one thing i had to look forward to was my vacation, which has now been cancelled and i do not know how i am supposed to handle everything anymore throwaway account because i am too much of a bitch to post on my main. i am years old, had to drop out of college after one year because i am too poor, have been working an extremely dead end job for the past six months and just do not know what to fucking do anymore. i went to college for one year but had to drop out because i could not afford it. i have zero friends, and my job is overnights for hours, four days on four days off and only pays minimum wage. i am male and i work with five ladies who are all each over so there is zero fucking connection between them and me. i do not have a car yet so i am still stuck at this job for at least another couple of months until i can get one because i am getting carpooled right now. my only friend moved to mississippi a few years back and we have been growing more thistant and hardly have anything in common anymore. when i am not at work the only thing i want to do is sleep and i get very little enjoyment out of activities that i used to love, and on days i do not work it is hard to force myself to do anything. my parents are poor so they can not afford to put me on their health insurance and i can not afford it myself. the one thing i had to look forward to was a vacation to portland that i have been planning for over six months, but now due to all this coronavirus bullshit i have to reschedule. i can reschedule my plane tickets but my airbnb was booked outside of the refund date so there is dollars down the fucking drain. i do not know what i am supposed to fucking do anymore. that was the one fucking thing i had going for me and now that is been fucking taken away from me as well.	severe
i feel like there is no point in being alive anymore. i am so bored and tired all the time. i work nightshift which definitely does not help my depression. i literally work, eat, and sleep. i do not want to do this for the rest of my life. i have a boyfriend who i love, but we have a turbulent relationship. partly due to my depression and other mental illnesses, and him being unable or unwilling to understand. for example, i am literally never horny and am repulsed by my body, and i try to tell him that, but it always ends with him being angry at me and turning it around saying you do not make me feel wanted. i am sorry i can not turn you on. i have tried so hard to make him understand, but he does not. while we were fighting over this and the fact that i had burned myself and was talking about how i do not want to live anymore , he told me you re just too broken. today my dog bit his friend in the face. my dog is friendly to literally everyone except this one man, who knew my dog did not like him, but he decided to get in his face anyway and got bit. he started yelling and saying he would throw my dog against the wall, punch my dog, kill my dog. i was in shock and did not really apologize well due to the fact i was angry he was talking about killing the only thing in life that has kept me living this far. now the guy has filed a police report, and if he ends up going to the doctor for it, i will have to pay his medical bills. thank god he is not pressing charges, but yeah. my boyfriend is on his side, saying there must be something wrong with my dog. i kept saying what kind of friend is that? and he told me he would do the same thing. he said if the roles were reversed and he got bit he would beat the fuck out of the dog too. i told him i will fix this by never coming over to his apartment with my dog again. he is going to continue being friends with the guy. my friends do not ever talk to me. we have been friends since high school. i understand we re doing our own things now, trying to grow up. there was a period of time last year my mental health was so bad i could barely leave the house. i had isolated myself and deleted all social media. no one asked me what was wrong. they would just get mad when i said i did not want to go out. i ended up apologizing to them for sinking down into my depression hole, which was met with them telling me yeah, i was pissed at you, but i know how you are and forgiveness. does me being depressed need to be forgiven? i have no motivation to do anything. everything bores me. i will start a tv show and drift off thinking or playing on my phone or changing the show. i can not keep interest in any hobbies. i will start a project and days later i would not care about it anymore. i had not cut myself in a year. i quit taking my birth control and all hell broke loose in my mind. i did not cut, but i held a knife over a lighter and then burned myself. just to feel something. just to focus on anything. i really feel like life is not worth living. nothing in my life is fun. i do not even have the motivation or want to do anything fun. i just want to sleep and smoke and hate my life. i only have dollars to my name, no savings. i have a car and a place to live rent free, so i am blessed in that aspect. but is it a blessing if i do not even want to live? why do i deserve this? there are so many people who deserve this, and i do not. i deserve to fucking rot in the dirt. i have been thinking about taking my dollars and just driving across the country with my dog. it is not a feasible idea, but it is where my mind likes to escape to when i am not down enough to think about suicide. i guess i think that on my little journey i will find something worth living for. i always try to run when things get hard. but by then i will have lost my job and run out of money. i get like this so often, but recently it just feels like shit keeps happening to me. i keep getting shit on over and over. i am stuck at dollars , and can not seem to get more than that without something happening and me having to pay. i have been planning on going back to school, but i am not excited. i know i am just going to fail like i have before. i will get all these classes and be so ready to learn, and then a month in i will say what is the point and flunk out half of them. i truly hate myself. i do not think i can change. i am a horrible, pathetic excuse for a human being and i really must deserve the bad things that happen to me.	moderate

reflecting but not in a good way my bf of . years has brought up once again how i was a hoe before we were together. for some context, we were in high school. my father had passed away my freshman year and i was looking for attention, and i was sexually assaulted right before my junior year and kind of went crazy my theory is that i was trying to reclaim myself but really i just slept around a lot . we started dating right before senior year and now we re in college. i of course feel like absolute shit about all of this. i wish i could take it all back, but i can not. i tried to kill my self after i was raped, and at times like this i wish i would have succeeded. maybe i deserved to get raped because i was being a hoe. god i just feel so horrible and i wish i could do something about it but i can not express that to him because i do not want him to think i am pulling the suicide card to make him feel bad. bringing that shit up genuinely puts me in this weird mindset and mood for a few days. i remember back when i was so depressed that i have a lot of lost memories and things that i repressed. i remember how i felt when i smoked weed every single day because it was easier to thissociate than to kill myself. i do not know what to do. he is a great guy he just makes me feel like shit when he brings this up. i feel like i regress back to my year old self when this happens.	moderate
empty i wanted to have friends. people to share experiences with. people to make the world feel smaller. i made it through high school and college thinking that i had friends. i did not realize that i was the one always reaching out to them. i did not see that i was changing my habits and opinions with the hope of fitting in. not only am i friendless, but everyone else seems so well connected. everyone goes to each other is weddings and hangs out together. so many dating, married, starting families. i do not have any of that, not for a lack of trying. i feel empty.	not depression
i think this is my final straw and i am scared warning this is very long. i am not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. maybe i will get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone. i have started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. this is yet another attempt, let us see what happens. i am a year old woman, i work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in graphic design, volunteer at a cat rescue days a week, and suffer from depression and social general anxiety thisorder. i first realized my teen angst was not just a phase sometime in my early s. as a teenager i would do the normal things drink, do drugs, smoke weed. i would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. i have since lost that precious notebook, but i did come upon snippets of that poetry in my other sketchbooks. the stuff was not anything out of the ordinary i grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. i lost interest in that activity around the age of . i was always a shy person. i played with friends during school, but i was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone is house. as a result, i was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. my parents brought me to canada when i was years old in order to expand my options for education. i was born in russia where there was not much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. in that aspect, i thank them. i was able to attend an art school in toronto and attain my graphic design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates. when i arrived in canada i did not speak much english and was in an esl program. in that first year, th grade, i was bullied for not speaking the language. some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks the little pebbles from the playground down my pants while we had carpet time when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson. they knew i wouldn t say anything, partly because i could not physically, partly because i could not mentally. kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. i brushed it off, went on with it. i did have two great friends one of which is still in my life albeit we are not close. this chilthish bullying subsided after the first year. i went off to another school in grade after moving buildings with my parents. th grade was split. it was yet another school moving from elementary to middle school and then half way through th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, i was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. i had to start over with the friend thing and luckily i befriended a girl right away. she was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also did not fit in with the cool popular kids. here i was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having friend, and being so extremely shy. after a while i became close with another girl, let us call her jessica. th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. i was also developing extremely bad acne, so i was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years. ending of th grade is where the real trouble started with jessica. she had an in with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, i got to hang out with the group occasionally. this is where we started relationships with two boys. she was with lets call him andrew and i was with let us call him mike. we would hang out after school a lot and one day i brought them all over to my house. mike took me down to my parent is cellar at one point and where i thought i would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. i did not know how to retaliate so i went with it. instead of a first kiss, i gave my first hand job. the next time we hung out was at the movies. i was brought to the bathroom for what i thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. i can not remember whether i went through with it, i just remember crying that evening. i soon found out that andrew and mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. these things bled into high school. the rumours started that i was a slut and were reinforced with photos being thistributed throughout the school. the photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun fashion night. she wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got thistributed. finally a new girl came to the school lets call her beth and finally things seemed to calm down. we had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school to the point where people were calling us lesbians. i even attended her wedding two years ago, she is a beautiful human being. i tried my best to have a normal life. i threw myself into art. i would come to school at in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. i got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. of course throughout this time i did the regular teenage girl stuff. i liked boys, i would make out with them. i was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. i just did it. it made them happy. and in my mind, that made me good at it. why not do the thing that i felt i excelled at? of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. i first tried drugs in th grade. beth and i would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. this went on for about a year in the th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. i am not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but i managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. at the end of th grade i met lets call him sam. we dated for years, i lost my virginity to him, but i will always remember doubting his intentions. did he stay with me for the sex? did he only want me around because i would smoke weed with him? it did not matter. i lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit i just did not want to, or could not break. i got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. after my break up with sam, i met lets call him dale. it was interesting at first. he would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. he brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. i now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. he wouldn t take no for an answer even if i did not really feel like doing anything. the thing with dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. we were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. i was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. as you well know by now, i have trouble saying no. so we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. i know how shameful it is to drink and i drive. i know first hand because i almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. i have not done it since and will never do it again. we were in the car and i was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. but he wouldn t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. i did it just to make him shut up so i could go home. i have not seem him since them. i refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. to this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. the truly destructive behaviour started around when i began to frequent parties. at first it was drinking, and a lot of it. then i met a year old man lets call him izack. he was a dj and very much into the rave party scene. it was with him when i tried coke for the first time at the age of or . lets just call the rest a blur. i would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. long story short, i just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor is heart. i loved izack. he was older, had more experience, best sex i have ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. he lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. the sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. i would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict russian parents. then izack started going on the road a lot more due to his dj career flourishing. when he was away, i would come to his place and clean everything. i bought him a huge new tv for his room. i wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. in my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. about a year into our relationship, i went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that i have an std. they told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. it was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but i had to have a serious conversation with izack. he swore on his life that he never cheated on me. he begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, i finally did. but i never got over the nagging feeling that something was not right. so after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday i remember that day so clearly , i asked him one more time. i am not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how i contracted the std. i was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. the drugs and alcohol increased. i went on tinder and began my first sex binge. at one point i managed to sleep with different men in one week. all i wanted to do was to forget the hurt and i did not know how. again, all of this is very blurry so i can not say the exact moment that izack came back into my life but he did. i remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say i forgive him and that i am moving on. that meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. we then got back together , continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. i let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. i think this is where i learned how to numb my brain from hurt. i was not mad at him anymore, i just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on tinder. after a few months of this, i met a guy lets call him jon. we dated for something close to a year. this relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. but at this point i did not want another life. the relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. for example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. i was told i was crazy on an almost daily basis. i will fast forward to the end, where a girl who is now a friend reached out to me saying that she was also dating jon, for months now. she spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. it turns out, that we weren t the only ones. i came to the knowledge that he had slept with different people during the span of being with me. this included his upstairs neighbour who i was constantly told not to worry about. i laughed at this. i did not cry, i did not feel angry, i laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next tinder binge i went. it took me about months to get into my next relationship. this one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. it lasted for about years. i met his parents and he met mine. we were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. we just weren t right for each other. so this is where i am now. years old, living back with my parents. i have since stopped the partying because that life does not satisfy me anymore and my body can not handle it. i have been coke free for about a year now mainly because i can not afford it. but i drink. i drink several times a week because i can not stand my job. i drink because i feel trapped in my own mind. i drink because of my living situation. i drink because nothing i do excites me. i drink about times a week and once i crack a bottle of wine, there is no way i can stop. that bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until i pass out. the job thing realized i am the only one who can help myself there so i have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just is not an option. i go to work, i laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that i took forward to is that next drink. i started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but i always fall off the boat because i can not stay excited and motivated. last night i came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and thisplayed in front of me by my dad. my mom thiscovered the first bottle in my closet when she could not find my cat, or so she says. she then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the or so i had hidden. long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and i am terrified. i feel like i have nothing happy to come home to. i spent all last night crying and today is the first day i did not show up to work because of this. the thing is i do not know if i want to stop. i have had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. i have cut myself on numerous occasions. i have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. i did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. my dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer i am not sure i want to take. i just want it to be over. the only times things are okay in my brain is when i am sleeping, or when i am heavily buzzed. i do not have children, nor a boyfriend and i have maybe friends, so i am finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. i would like to finish by saying how awful i feel about putting this out there. the amount of times the word i is used is upsetting and selfish since i know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. like my parents have pointed out numerous times, i have nothing to be sad about. i have a good job, a warm house, food and water. i have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. and they are right. i have it so good. but inside, that dark cloud just would not lift and there is no way i can describe it in words to someone who has not felt the pull of it. thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. i am very scared and for some reason the only thing i thought of this morning was writing this.	severe

i am so empty i wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. i ponder if i want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. i look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. i begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. to once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. maybe even death. my reminiscing is cut short by a year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. felicity. my baby sister is one of the few reasons i get up in the morning. and to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what i guess was joy. it is now time for me to put on the mask. i have learned many things about depression in the past years. one of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. the trauma, and pain i have experienced from the hospitals i have been subjected to, are second to none. absolute agony. so i wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy. i walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding felicity is hand, and i am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. today i must play with felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. i also can not talk to either of my parents about how i am doing, because i would be bothering them. i do not do most of these things. i simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. i do this everyday. i fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. i do this everyday. i eat. and eat, and eat, and eat, until i feel like throwing up. i do nothing with my life. the only thing i do is listen to music. i love music. i truly adore all kinds of it. i love learning about music. i love listening to music. i play instruments, and produce music. but i do not anymore depression has taken away my future. i do not have the drive to create music. so i just sit. i sit. i eat, i sleep, and i do it all again. i am so alone, i am so sad. i am so empty. not quite sure what this post is, but i feel like shit, and do not want to live like this anymore. any advice is appreciated	moderate
it is so hard to reach out i have been on and off severely depressed since the fall. i work really hard to manage it and am seeing a new therapist this coming week but the working hard to manage part is so exhausting sometimes or maybe all the time idk. i know isolating myself is not healthy to the point of it being dangerous but it is just so hard to deal with other people. people i am not open about my situation with are exhausting and or irritating to be around. i get so drained by just an hr or two of socializing and a lot of things i would normally love are just out of the question. which makes me sad about being depressed i am also having a hard time with the people that do know what is going on to some extent. i hate dealing with their reactions, even the kind ones. people ask what they can do to help and i just do not have anything to tell them. i wish i did because i know they want to help. i keep canceling and not following up on tentative plans because i just sit around and cry. i dont want anyone to see me like that. ori amanxious and can not properly make decisions about anything. i think an unanswered text means someone hates me etc and then i am so out of sorts i can not handle hanging out when they do answer. i have been friends with people who get severely depressed and while l love and care for them i know first hand how hard it can be to be around them. i feel so guilty that i am now that person to others. i do not want to harm people with how unhappy i am but i am afraid i am which makes me isolate more and i see how this is a negative reinforcing loop. so how do you deal with other people? do you have things you ask them to do for you because it will at least make them feel better? how do you respond to, is there anything i can do? how do you deal with not wanting to be a burden but also not completely isolating yourself?	moderate

here my story..kinda i was when my baby brother passed away. heres the thing i only found out i was three almost a couple years ago . which tbh shocked me cause no one ever talk to me about the situation but i have a strong memory with it. whole ordeal was violent. so it just stuck i guess. i feel guilty for even feeling bad about it. i was beaten and my dad at the time i think he sexually abused me. i was adopted. i was hell to raise. no one understood why such small things would send me on a rampage. i feel so bad to anyone who was my friend. i was possessive. i was so toxic. i just didnt want to be lonely. i am sorry. i was bullied all through elementary to middle school. i had social anxiety it physical hurt my face felt like a thousand needles poking it and like someone lit me on fire.and on my grandmother theres no exaggeration there. and through high school i never learned how to love myself after all those years of bullying. i craving for love and willing to do anything for it. i have such unreasonable violent mood swings though it makes me feel so ugly. but i am still clingy as ever. tbh i think i want to get admitted to a hospital for a month atleast. i am not stable and also having delusional ideas. getting graphic here. but i am struggle so hard right now my emotions have full control. i am suffocating. i want release like self harm but it would be noticeable so i guess i can not. i have no solid friends cause of my behavior which makes sense i am happy they left and didntstick around with such a mess as me.....back to my emotions theres so black and white. dry or wet. up or down. and again such violent mood swings feels like two people in my body fighting each other. and i am just so tired so so soooooo tired. i want to know everything will be okay.i want to rest my thoughts. i am exhausted. i want to feel love. i wish i was never born.	moderate
i feel so worthless . . . among my friends i feel like the dud of the group. i can not even enjoy their company at this point, i feel so dumb, so annoying, and so unfunny, and immature. i know they are fed up with me and my unstable moods, i basically have moods either saying something no one cares about, or not speaking cause i feel empty and feel no reason to. i do not understand why they hang around me, i assume they enjoy the things they are able to get from me, or just feel like its weird to ditch me at this point. around my family i feel like an outsider and a burden. when ever i leave my room they are all talking together, or eating dinner, mean while i rush back to my room as fast as i can. i do not feel comfortable speaking to them or even being around them. they used to tease me asking about when i am going to get a girlfriend like at family gatherings but i think they just realized its never going to happen for me and just stopped asking all together. i have achieved nothing especially compared to my siblings , and worst of all i know how my extended family sees me, i am the only one like this among them, everyone else is social, with each other, laughs and has a good time, while i avoid eye contact and quietly answer any questions asked.	moderate
depressed ex sending weird signals so after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after i ghosted her boring message, i texted my ex telling her i cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. she replied with a yeah well you too i did not reply. later in the day she sent me a snapchat telling me she was drunk new years eve nothing else interesting though. i was like yay have fun, and we did not talk the rest of the night she is in europe rn i am in the states . i did not send her a happy new years or anything when it turned midnight here. in the morning i woke up to a happy new years, and all the best for you! i replied with a thanks and you too . no other text communication although i replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. i am confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said could not feel anything, and later said she could not love me or anyone else right now. i find it kind of weird she would include the lovey emoji, she does not use them much and it is just something i feel an ex wouldn t send to someone they broke up with. she is also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad i ghosted her understandable and has never been the type to double text or contact first. any thoughts? i am not desperate to get back together, i know maybe she is just trying to be nice and be friends i am not interested in a platonic friendship, i will be nice and talk sometimes but i am not going to be friendzoned but i feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something.	not depression
i wasted an entire decade. back in , i thought by now i would have my shit together. a career, a degree, true love, something. instead, i am in the same place i was back then, except my youth is officially over. i am turning this year. everyone my age is settling down and staying inside. soon, my body will give out on me too. i used to be a fat kid, but i have gotten a lot more active in the past couple years. what is the point if i am just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? i am finally serious about going to college, but the only way i can afford it is if i abuse the shit out of myself. i work hour days between work and school, and since i am a freshman, i do not even see any reward for my effort except getting closer to the cost of my degree every week if i am lucky. even my personal taste is becoming old people. according to posts from r starterpacks and elsewhere, things i like such as indie music, craft beer and tattoos are apparently insufferable pretentious yuppie boomer millennial shit now. i feel like i am becoming grandpa simpson i used to be with it , but then they changed what it was. now what i am with is not it anymore and what is it seems weird and scary. it will happen to you! 	moderate
depressed girlfriend wants to isolate herself hi, i have no idea if this is the right sub but i really hope so. some background info i am , year into a long thistance relationship with my girlfriend. we re both in our early to mid s. i most likely would not be able to see her again for a few months because of the corona virus. she lives in a toxic home and has both depression and an eating thisorder. she is had it for the whole time during our relationship, but the three past months it has progressively gotten worse to the point were she is now suicidal everyday. i do my best to support her but i know i make mistakes sometimes. the problem two days or so ago she begged me to please let her isolate herself for a few weeks or so. she said she wanted to just be alone and think. i was a little hesitant and asked questions but wanted to respect her wishes. a few hours later she came home from finally visiting a mental health professional again, and she admitted something to me the isolation was a plan to make people stop loving her her words so that she could kill herself easier in a month or so. she then begged me to do not let her kill herself and do not let her isolate even if she says she wants to. she suggested that i could call her and talk ot her instead if she ever wants to isolate again. yesterday which was about days later, she said she wanted to isolate again. she made a video where she explained her reasoning behind it. she said that she is too sad to talk to anyone right now and that she wants to just think about what she has, what she is and start a journey with herself. something like that, i do not know how to summarize it. but well, she is begging me to please let her do this if she i love her. she said i promise to not to anything and we will meet in two months if the corona situation has gotten better, and we will travel together . she also said that she will text me good morning and good night every day so that i know she is there, and that i can send her texts and pictures but should not expect her to do the same or even answer. she said that she want to do this for a few week or even months. if the circumstances were different i would just respect her wishes without questioning them. but i am really scared that this is just another plan to kill herself. even if it is not, i worry that her being almost totally isolated with just her toxic family will make her depression worse. and oh, her country is quarantined so she would not go to work or see any friends at all for at least weeks. i am really worried about her. she is saying i am going to isolate now, bye. talk to you soon again and things like that. she seems really determined but i do not know if i should let this happen because of what she said days ago. and now she just texted me please pray that nothing will happen to me . wtf this is giving me so much anxiety. i do not know what to do, i do not want her to kill herself.	not depression
my depression is ripping my relationship apart. i do not know what to do anymore. this year will be years since my fianc and i first started dating. i have been going through a bad time these past couple of months with my depression hitting a new low now for the holidays. my fianc tried to be helpful at first. he would always tell me to just take it day by day and that we d figure it out together. he would tell me to lean on him when i need to, to talk to him or yell and rant and rave at him if it would make me feel better and he would ride it out with me. well, i took him up on that offer for once, choosing to open up rather than bottle it up and deal with it myself like i usually do. now, all we have done is fight these past couple weeks, and i am so fed up with it. i have been going through a lot of stuff lately, i have been open and honest and vocal about my mental illness, but he takes my illness too personally and i do not know what to do. yes, i have not been as cuddly or kissable and i have been irritable these past couple weeks, but come on, i warned him about this, told him do not extend an offer to help if you re just going to spin it on how horrible of a girlfriend i am. i told him i did not want to open up in this way because i knew he was going to take everything personally and end up making me feel even worse. every gd day he looks for a way to low blow me about how i do not love him or care about him because i am so grumpy and all i want to do is fight. no, i just want you to stop being such a d head and stop kicking me when i am already down. i can not get him to understand that not everything is about him. i know what i need to feel better and that is just time and patience to recover and find myself again and quite frankly i do not have the energy to try and kiss up to my fianc . i barely have enough to get myself out of bed most days and now i have my whole life for years crumbling in front of me and i just do not even know what to do anymore. happy new years to me i guess...	moderate

how do i overcome this feeling of loneliness? its been years now, since i have not had any best friends. i have no siblings and my parents are workaholics. so at the end of the day it is me alone at the house. these years i have been all alone because i failed my second year at college,so people just stopped talking with me or having very less contact. the failure of academics and an ankle relocation injury have taken a toll on me and since then, i have been nothing but depressed. i can not find my way to life again. i am scared to even cross a street guys. zero confidence i have from myself. i still fail and try to get back up but being so unloved and underappreciated is just making feel so lonely and i can not really go on like this man. i tried to these years but now i am so tired, i just can not continue any further. i feel like giving up already.	moderate

new years okay so for a couple years now i have been feeling depressed, and a year ago maybe, i told my mum i wanted some help e.g. therapy, doctor , yet she said no because it would show up on my record and would look bad i guess for jobs but idk why they would need to know that . anyway, this year it was particularly bad especially round xmas, cause of a number if things our family like fully fell apart so we have no more contact with my grandparents, cousins etc., i do not really want to say anything specific due to privacy things but a close family member ended up in hospital from the th xmas eve to the th, and on top of that my mum brought her boyfriend over for xmas, who i do not like and they have only known each other for like months anyway. so after all of this i go out with some friends for new years and this is where it gets bad. i usually drink and i am fine with it but for new years i think just cause i was really down i just drank a shit ton and blacked out, so my friends had to take care of me. that is one thing is that they had to take care of me which i feel bad about cause i genuinely ruined their night, but on top of that after one person sent me the videos i just saw myself saying stuff that was super out of hand in that i was just unloading all of my emotions and talking about how i hated life etc. so now i feel like shit cause i feel like i was such an asshole by drinking that much and making it so unpleasant for everyone else. but now i am thinking more about what happened and after talking to my mates some more i think the best way forward is to get some help, yet i know that when i ask my mum she will say no. the other thing is i may be able to get help without parents involved, i do not know how that all works. anyway that is what i wanted to get out, i just want some help, thanks	moderate

stuck i have a complicated history with this one girl. she led me on for a month and then rejected me when i asked her out and that kinda fucked with me for awhile and we got in a bunch of fights but then we grew closer again only for her to fuck with me more and eventually i said out friendship can not work and we didnt talk for months but i thought about her every day. as soon as i started doing better she came back into my life and i convinced myself i was over her and we could just be friends but i obviously am not. she ignores me except for when she needs attention and she knows she can get it from me.i amaware of this but i can not get over her even though i know shes bad for me in every way. how do i genuinely get over her. ive tried thistancing myself and it didnt work. i tried thistracting myself with other girls and i still couldnt stop thinking about her. what do i do ive felt stuck for so long	not depression
i lost a friend to suicide hey, friends. i wanted to share this in hopes that it helps just one person or puts things into perspective. two weeks ago i found out my friend passed away. he took his own life. i worked with him for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and him and i would go out by ourselves once a month or so. we weren t super close, but we were good friends. when he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. three weeks before he died, i called him up and asked for a huge favor. he lived within a mile of me and i needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted him to show me how. he had plans that night but said they could wait and he would be over within an hour. when he arrived, i asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. i asked if everything was okay and he said not really, but that is life! he helped me change the tire, i gave him a hug and told him we should get drinks soon. him and i had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so i wanted to be there for him. i did not reach out soon enough. when i heard the news i was in shock. i was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. when i drove home that night i cried. i took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that him and i would go to. i had to pull over because i was crying so hard. i was sobbing and screaming it would have been okay, i promise you. everything would have been okay. as if he could hear me. the next day, i had to leave work because i could not stop crying. i took the day after that off. i could not think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. whenever i was outside i would think that everything just felt different. the world feels different and empty without him in it. you always think about how sad your parents will be, your best friends, your so. he was not my best friend, we saw each other once every or months. even ex coworkers who had not seen him in a year are grieving massively. my coworkers and i arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and i witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. of us who worked with him showed up, one drove hours to be there. the others opted out because they were still struggling so much they will be attending the official memorial . my point is, death reaches so much further than you think it will. i have been there, and i know that when you re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life will be better off without you. i have also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. i also recognize that everyone has different struggles and i am not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. but experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to him were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. anyways, this was way longer than i expected. reach out to your friends and tell them you love them and are there for them, if you re in a place mentally where you are able to do so. and feel free to reach out to me personally if you are struggling.	severe
anyone else simply not interested in anything? i am not sure if this is the right sub cos i do not feel really any emotion towards it, i am just neutral about it. i am simply not interested in anything at all. i do not care about reading, interacting with anyone, have no hobbies, or anything that i am interested in. i play just counter strike to pass the time but i do not really have a lot of fun at all doing it and i am just bored as i am playing it. it seems like i have been just existing for over a year now. i do not care about getting into a relationship, i could not care less about future plans or goals nor the words that come out of anyone is mouth. i just do not care about anything. every day is just about trying to get it done with as fast as possible as no day has anything of value for me. even in experiences like travelling to new places which should be nice i just think wow what is even the point of this. anyone else think this way?	not depression

i think i need to leave my partner of years my girlfriend and i have been together for ten years and i do not know what to do anymore. she suffers from depression, anxiety and severe ocd. over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it is just too much for me, we do not see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i have ended up having to cancel plans. it is our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she does not want go. fair enough, but i have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself. she is not from here so has no family or friends here who are not mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but i am exhausted. i can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she does not want me to tell anyone. she believes she is just in the way and makes everyone is life shit, i try and tell her it is not true but it is so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she would be better off dead, she is threatened suicide before so i feel like if i leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it is not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she is better off dead. idk anymore, i really do not. i do not even know if this is just kme being an asshole i am just lost and confused and tired. i still love her but she just does not care about life anymore. she stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, i respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it is absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication. idk please help, should i leave? i am so worried about her but also worried about myself and just feel sick.	not depression

i need help making the choice to get better i have been talking with multiple people in my support group and all of them say i need to choose whether i want to stay in the dark, or if i want to see the light. my main problem is i have no motivation whatsoever. so when i am told to do something it is very difficult to start that task. so when i am told i should make a decision about getting better it is hard. obviously the choice would be to pick the getting better side. but i have been in the dark so long it is hard for me to change how i have been feeling. i feel more comfortable in the dark then in the light. so making a decision to get better is extremely difficult and i am not sure what to do. i am scared because i am not going to choose to stay in the dark but i can not get myself to choose the positive choice to get better. i am stuck in between the decisions. if anyone has any advice i would really appreciate hearing it. thanks.	severe
depression my thoughts and experiences depression is hard to deal with!! trust me i know. i want to try and sum up in a few paragraphs what depression means to me and how i have learned to deal with it and understand it. if the cause of our depression is out of our control, we have to try and acknowledge the fact that life will throw us curve balls, takes the wind out our sails and pull the rug from under our feet when we least expect it. it is not about what happens to us it is about how we deal with it that matters. my depression has been caused not by uncontrollable life events, but by my own stupidity, my own poor decisions, my own silly behaviour, my own horrific mistakes. my sadness was caused by nothing but myself. this is a much more bitter pill to swallow but can still be fixed over time. however our depression came about, it is our brain that is overwhelmed by negative thoughts. be it anger or self hate, suicide or self harm, past thistresses or consequences. negative thoughts are playing on a loop in our brain, the longer we allow the negative thoughts to continue the harder it will be to emerge from our depression. i know, trying to tell a person with depression to think positively sounds like a load of bullshit right? but introducing positivity is the only thing that will work. we have to try and see a positive way forward, where we exercise and eat nutritious food. where we hang out and laugh with friends. where we start to love and care for the people around us or picture ourselves with a new partner and finally move on from that emotional break up. for me, when i am at my lowest i would lose my appetite and wouldn t go to the gym. i would lose muscle mass and start to look skinny. when i did eat it was just junk food to make the hunger go away. my sleeping pattern was lost and i had dark circles under my eyes. i stopped cleaning my house and allowed it to get messy and unhygienic. i stopped seeing friends and family and cancelled plans because i looked horrific. my job suffered and my finances took a hit. no matter how bad things appear we should try to remain positive in the important areas of our life. depression will come and go but our health and hygiene can deteriorate quick when we do not look after ourselves. building up from rock bottom each time is difficult, try to avoid hitting rock bottom by staying positive enough to look after ourselves well. laying in a dark room and obsessing over events that happened last week, last month or last year will get us nowhere, a nutritious meal and phone call to a friend will get us somewhere. allow positivity in and slowly our depression will ease. thanks for reading.	moderate
fml. i have lost so many friends due to me not feeling like i was good enough and telling myself that they hated me, and not being able to express myself. fast forward to years later and i know i am depressed and that is why i had those thoughts, but they are long gone and i have to now deal with this on my own. they probably think of me as a terrible friend and i feel like they are better off without me. i do not deserve them. i feel like i let them down and even if i tried reaching out they would be so annoyed at me, which i totally understand.	moderate
i think it is just my time at this point. i can not live hating myself constantly. it is does not seem like it is going to end. everybody thinks i am annoying, including myself. nobody would be sad if i ended my life. in fact, they would probably piss on my grave. my life is not worth it anymore. i have a friend who you vent to but they have run out of things to say and i think they are trying to signal to me that they do not care. there is not anything i am looking forward to, except the sweet release of death. i do not have a good reason to live. if i am lucky, covid will do it for me, as i have asthma.	moderate

i feel like i have never really helped anyone. my whole life i have always had some kind of hero complex. i wanted to be there for people and to be wanted and respected for it, but i have always failed. my first big failure i was only . my neighbor was a girl who quickly became my best friend because of proximity, we were the only two houses in the area the rest were cheap motels. so we would hang out pretty much daily and play games mostly ones emulating tv characters which usually put me in a hero and her in a damsel in thistress situation. well the whole time we were friends she was regularly being raped by one of her dad is friends, as were her siblings. so great hero work there. after a few years our houses were both torn down to build a supermarket, i did not see her again til high school and she could barely stand to ever look at me. my mom was an alcoholic, manic depressive, had a rare genetic thisorder and plenty of other problems. she was irresponsible and i tried to keep her on track, playing the parenting role from a young age. i never managed to actually keep her on track. she ended up dying from illness at , if i had actually managed to get her to stop even one of her bad habits, smoking, drinking, hell drinking pepsi...maybe she wouldn t be dead and i wouldn t be alone. i joined the coast guard because i wanted to finally be able to help someone. six years i did not do anything to help anyone except my superiors in the coast guard. no lives were saved by anything i worked on or was a part of in six years. not even by proxy, my entire unit did not do shit to help anyone, it was a combat focused unit. now the closest thing i have to a social life is posting on reddit. giving advice to people, sometimes ones who did not ask it. advice that is probably useless because it is coming from me, someone who is a mentally ill failure that is barely ever been able to function in society. the fuck do i know? i do not even leave the house. i did used to give my excess dumpster diving stuff to homeless people, that is the most i have done to help anyone in my life that i can think of. it is not enough, and it was years ago.	not depression

feeling stuck, trapped and alone during the last years, i have worked about . i have had to come back from a hanging attempt, hospitalisation and the realisation my family did not care. so i ditched them i got back into my career and things seemed possible for a while, then i was evicted due landlord selling up, unexpectedly dragged into my father is death by my extended family and fired by email from a hostile new job, when i was off sick with stress. that knocked me over again and pretty much killed off any remaining trust in people. even my cousin is uncaring, very well paid job, fancy audi and i never hear from her. after a few more years of therapy, i was offered jobs again, i chose one that required relocating. lodged with someone for a few months who was super controlling and i have ended up in a run down houseshare i am contracted in until july. i do not sleep well the new job sucks, i am surrounded by selfish, dysfunctional people working for a government agency. the whole things been a waste of time and my mental health is worse now than when i was on sickness benefits. i was looking forward to a fresh start and it is been such a huge thisappointment. i am and after pulling myself back from the dead years ago, the last few years have just robbed me of everything. i have literally got one friend left on this entire planet and they live in berlin. over years of therapy and part qualified in counseling and all i can honestly say after all my efforts in life is that most people are so fucked up they do not even know how fucked up they are. so they go around fucking everyone else up in their arrogant ignorance. i have no reason to trust people anymore, i doubt i have ever met many people who were worthy of trust and i feel they are in the minority.	not depression

my friend is a strange eunuch... he said that due to an injury at the age of , he became impotent. when i clarified the details, it turned out that it was influenced by the viewing of hard pornography and then he saw the murderous torture of other people in the forest in real life. he was heartbroken. his parents introduced him to psychologists not psychiatrists, but followers of pseudoscience . but they could not help him. as a result, he asked at age to castrate. he was made a eunuch. now he has no sexual attraction, although he is years old. he suffered humiliation, suffered from thisability. but now he is supposedly glad to be a eunuch. does he lie? is he sick, does he need treatment?	not depression
nothing makes me really happy anymore. i was going to put effort into this post about how my school, work, family, partner, friends, self worth, confidence, and what i expect for my future just refuses to be any more than lackluster, but i do not know why anyone would care. i think i would have to write a book about it. i would see a therapist, but i definitely can not afford that either. oh and also all of my wisdom teeth are impacted and hurt like hell all of the time but can not afford that either. i just can not catch a break and wish i could just thisappear for a little while. i am not suicidal, but i do not want any of this life anymore but there really is no way to get out of it.	not depression

i feel like a caged animal with the whole covid pandemic and what not, i feel even and even more trapped. college and my apartment used to be an escape from the sort of monotonous life i led before then and actually gave my life structure, independence, or some purpose, as pathetic as that sounds. but, with all of this, i am now stuck at home with my parents who i recently had a falling out with so its just, uncomfortable and i dread it here. and i recently got an email from my college that they will be going to online classes for the rest of the semester. wonderful, i get to stay home even longer and feel the scraps of motivation and life i had before continue to slip away even further. my identity and purpose is just slipping away like a second skin. i already had a shaky sense of self to begin with thanks to my thissociation issues but this is just, adding insult to injury. i feel likei amgoing to go to bed one day andi amgoing to wake up to realize nothing was real to begin with, that everything was fake. doesnt help that i already feel unreal pretty much all of the days now. there is nothing to do. well, there is, but nothing i care about anymore. i used to like writing and drawing and creating but now its just empty empty and pointless. classic depression am i right? sure, the meds have been working but my environment still has impact and this is just making things worse. feeling trapped and held up likei amsome fish won at a carnival game by a kid whos going to let me die in a few days due to shitty care. my friends. can i even call them that anymore? they seem like strangers and feel like them too. i try to talk to them and i feel like they dont really care or are bothering to spend as much time as i put into them to even comfort me. its always about them really. like i want to thisappear. guess my lifetime warranty is wearing out. guess the only thing left to do is completely thisappear, something like that. its not active suicidal ideation but fizzling and fading away might as well be the best option here to save myself from wasting more time on things i dont care about. a sort of mercy kill. they take take and take and never give back until they realize its too late and should have given more so they could keep taking from me down the line.	not depression

wondering if anyone else has felt like this. so ive never believed myself to be depressed but ive always known myself to be very apathetic about things that are at least somewhat important to others. i often find that wheni amin a relationship i upset the other person by not taking their feelings seriously because i dont feel as strongly about them, if at all. i ended my last relationship because i couldnt feel as strongly about her as i wanted. looking back she was awesome in so many ways, and i realize how dumb i was. i look for stimulation in as many things as i can,i amglued to my phone, i love video games, and it drove a wedge between us because i need something to stimulate me or i feel so bored... i feel like i am not usually sad but just apathetic. lately ive been in a much more hopeless depression because of the fact that i know i have no control over how much things mean to me and it makes me spiral downward because i want to care about things like others do. i amnot great at explaining it, and ive considered suicide because of how hopeless i am. i know that i will not do it but it is tempting because of how little everything seems to matter. has anyone else ever dealt with this??	moderate
i have to try not to die of boredom i try to get out of the house as much as possible because the people i live with are all toxic and there is really nothing to do in the house but lay in bed and wish i was eternally asleep. i genuinely want to die when i am home, so i usually try to get out as much as possible. my daily routine consists of waking up at and going to school. i stay on campus until about before i head back home to eat dinner and sleep. the house is just a resting place for me and nothing else. i even go to campus on fridays when i do not have class, and my weekends and tuesday nights are usually occupied by a sailing program. but due to corona virus, my regatta i had over the weekend was canceled, along with our regular meetings and other events until further notice. the la college thistrict has moved all possible classes to online, so i would not be able to go on campus save only mondays and wednesdays for an art c i will ass that was unable to be placed online, but might end up getting canceled later on. last night i was lying down on a table on campus and started crying because i knew that after that night i will have almost nothing to preoccupy myself from my depression, boredom, and thoughts of suicide. any social events nearby have been canceled and there is no one willing to hang out in groups in public, so i am now housebound. i woke up at and it is now and i have yet to get out of bed. i may not have a high chance of dying if i get the virus, but i feel like the outbreak still has a chance of killing me through my own self destruction.	moderate
i am with it enough to know that i am not okay i am losing my mind, i know that i am so i suppose it is a good thing because i have not gone off the deep end. i have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. sometimes i think about punching myself and cutting i dont usually act on it. happy to say i have not cut myself in about years but i do hit myself, i have hit myself a lot tonight... i am really failing at work first year teacher i am so scared they are going to report me for incompetence, i am so nervous and freaked out i can hardly plan properly. the truth is i want to die, i am on my own in the universe. people may know about my depression but the truth is its inconvenient to have. because always tell me that i am doing fine and i look great or whatever. no i do not look great! i look exhausted and sound very unhappy! if my face was cut up and bleeding i would that is a very good reflection of what is going on inside! so i am just telling this to void because these thoughts keep floating in my mind.	moderate

glitched or cursed the first years of my existence hi you may not know me but i am azriel form the philippines. i am years old living with my family happily. happiness is just the tip of the iceberg to any emotions of any person . this is my current quote i have. i have been depressed for years since after i have ended my elementary days and currently ongoing to senior high school. the reason i am depressed is because bullying. my origin of bullying dates back to where i am graduating from preparatory trust until when the awarding came, i cried because of not awarding a medal. this was the main starting point before after years of being bullied. i would not detail too much on my elementary days because it is too sensitive to talk about. there is a stereotype filipino boys must follow, boys do not cry, they must be strictly tough that stereotype influenced all boys because father is are reminding to their son s. from grades to i had been bullying non stop almost every day. by grade it went calm but not too much but when grade came, this would trigger the foundation of my depression. with the last week of my elementary days, they bullied me nonstop unlimited because of my attitude background from prep to grade . they bullied me all day. it was so heavy, no one cared except my friends and family. i have been guidanced since grade to because of this issue. as i approach high school, i was expecting the same, and it did by grade in march it was announced that the school will be renovated and i did not cried not a single tear because my school did not treated about bullying. within grade was a new life because i studied at a christian school and i have met one of my classmates form prep. i will hide the name champaine. i have met her in roosevelt college cubao as a prep. student. however there is one student who came from public school last year. he was treating me like hidden bullying . in overall i had a great experience from this christian school and continued here for grade . by grade i am expecting one bully but it went multiple. there are of them, boys and girl but i would not name them because of my personal reasons. these were i hated the most but afraid to report because it has been repeated in my elem days. also in this timeline, i had a crush on the one i have been her classmate last year. however i did something i did not know it was illegal. on march , i have photographed her without asking her permission. they have caught the evidence i have did but i had nothing to do. that was on march , when they are scattering it. within that date, i had lost interest on her and i have promised to myself that i am not going to flirt another girl after i went home by p.m. and waited until p.m. i cried while mt little brother was sleeping because i think myself as a failure to this world. i am trash, useless, worthless. i wanted to suicide so much i have handled my scars since i have been bullied. it was too much pressure to handle like i hope one day i will die just one day to see who does care about me this is why untill now am i glitched or cursed? despite i did not went to a specialist in mental health there was a treatment i have found, coldplay i have been following coldplay since grade and their music relates me wether i am happy or sad and i encourage you to listen some of their music like fix you, everyday life, a sky full of stars, yellow, viva la vida, up and up, parathise and so much more. i hope you have read it and if you re posting it on fb, ig, twitter, yt or any other social media sites pls. feel free to notify me. as chris martin said believe in love thank you for reading this post and hoping for you to visit the philippines. just remember believe in love 	not depression

youth teen mental hospital cost? i have been having frequent thoughts and consideration of self harm and suicide and think requesting to go to a mental hospital for a bit might help. i am desperate at this point because nothing has seemed to have been working so far. countless therapy sessions, talks with my doctor, increasing and decreases my dosage of prozac, i even got sent to the emergency room one time by my therapist so that they could take me to a mental hospital but deemed me fine and sent me on my way even when i looked in the doctors eyes and flatly said i have frequent thoughts of suicidal and yesterday i got the closest to ever cutting myself in my entire life . the only thing really stopping me from talking to my parents, therapist or doctor about this is worrying about the cost for it happening. my parents already have to pay for so much shit that i have caused like my meds, therapy sessions, frequent doctor visits and that one emergency room fluke visit must have cost a shit ton even when all they did was give me a cold hamburger and took my blood. i only feel like it would be an even bigger burden which would only make me more suicidal honestly, which is a bit ironic since i am trying to go to a mental hospital to get help for that. i am from georgia, almost years old now. do costs vary from area to area? if anyone has any experience with this, what is a general idea of what the cost would be. i have a job right now, so maybe i can save up for my own stay. i am so desperate at this point that it might come to me just having to pay for it myself. that would probably take over a year honestly and i do not know how long i have before i do something rash. i appreciate any advice with this, thank you.	severe
depression shows you the truth of others. i know for a lot of people depression makes them isolate themselves. i, personally, crave interaction and all i have ever wanted was to feel like someone cared for me as much as i did them. i feel like my friends make my depression worse in this way because when i reach out to them during times of crisis or when i want to vent about something, i am often left with half ass replies or no replies at all. it sucks to be someone who is always there for others and to not be met with that same compassion. this in itself makes me want to isolate myself from my so called friends because their thistance and lack of concern for my well being makes me hate myself and my life more. in short, every time i am at my lowest point i am met with the reality that no ones cares about me. i feel like it would be easy for someone to assume that this is the depression talking but it is not. the depression just makes it easier to see the reality of others. thanks for reading.	moderate

annual depression day anybody else get triggered by something and think about a certain event when they are really sad lonely? for me it is my birthday, every year for the past . i remember loving my birthdays up to that point. we always had a tradition of singing and cutting the cake during at some point in the night. for my th birthday, whatever happened that day, my dad and sister either forgot or did not care enough to wish me happy birthday. to add insult to injury, it was just me singing with my mom that night while my dad and sister hung out upstairs with their doors closed. i know this might sound very whiny, and this was an isolated incident, but the fact that i can still hear my moms happy birthday to you and remember the tears streaming down my face afterwards while i ate my slice in my room just serves as a reminder to how heartbreaking this event no matter how small or insignifican not was to me. every year from that point on i have cried on every single one of my birthdays. not just because of this event, but mostly because i am just always lonely on my birthdays haha. it is just funny how it feels so good to make yourself feel worse when you already feel like shit.	not depression
i am a normal year old girl. this is my story of my battle with depression. it is long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it. i am just a year old girl, with an amazing family. i have parents who have given me the world, and i am the oldest sibling of . i have had a great education all of my life, i went to an awesome university in my town but i had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. i live on the east coast, and i have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life i dream of living. i have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. nowadays though, the life i dream of living consists of these few things energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. at this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. i took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety i had was starting to take a toll. originally i had just planned to take a semester off because i wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. i did not want to be out for too long because i thought i wouldn t want to go back. but that was in september. it is now march, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because i am not in school and i am watching all of my peers live the life i had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, i have developed depression. at first my psychologist did not think i was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. luckily it is a bit better now. but the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. i also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. but now fast forward, i most certainly have depression. we are aware of this now. what i do not understand about depression, and never did until i was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. i used to think, how could you feel hopeless? there are so many beautiful things in this world. there are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. you have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it . but now, i understand. i truly understood the hopeless feeling when i started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even want to do them, and have a reason for them. my body feels like a rock that i am lugging around. i feel like i do not even have the capacity to think like i used to, yet somehow i still have all of the energy to overthink. but my creativity is stifled, i do not see the world as colorfully as i used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we have had here for so long. i just do not have the energy for almost anything. and sometimes i will get myself going, but i do not feel as if i am doing my tasks or feeling things the way i used to. i do not feel full of life and wonder anymore. small moments do not bring me a boatload of joy. i used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it is always like i am searching for something bigger. which i know is not the issue here. it is just my brain. i drove to philly with a friend about weeks ago on a saturday just for fun, and i thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just did not. i was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than i usually was, but i could only keep that energy for so long. and once again, i did not feel how i used to feel before all of this hit. so, back to my original point. i feel hopeless. because how am i supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? i simply just do not have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities i need and want to do. i know what is good for me, what should be good for me and making me happy. after all, it used to. but i am always tired in some way. i never feel well rested. i used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it is bad for my brain. i tell myself i should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. that my body is worth taking care of. but i am just so sick of forcing myself to do things. and then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. and then feeling totally hopeless. i do not want to accept that i am depressed. i do not even like saying i am depressed, and i hate it even more when people say it is not curable. how is not it curable? i did not have it my whole life. maybe the signs were there subtly, but if i knew about them, i could have done something before i hit this barrier. my family has done everything for me and i love them so much. i really do. i absolutely love my parents. my mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. my dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. my siblings all have minds of their own, too. my sister is adventurous and creative like me. my brothers are, well, my brothers. haha. my grandma is an absolute saint. but a lot of the time, especially recently, it is hard not to thistance myself from my parents when i feel so down. i just feel like the thisappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. everything is always about what i am not doing, and i know it is because they care and think me doing things will help, but it is just not that simple. i get irritable, and this causes tension. i kind of isolate myself from them. not really, but i just do not initiate conversation with them. i feel awkward. i will fix this but it is just hard. somehow i hate admitting this because i never wanted to get to a place where i felt my significan not other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it is unhealthy my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. it would not be this way forever, but right now it is. maybe god, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. he is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person i know. this kid reassured me everyday, just because he feels like it, of how much he loves me, how i make him the happiest kid in the world, how i brighten his days, how i make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. and to me, they are not cliches because i know he means them. he reassured me that he knows who i am outside of this depression. he loves me for me. and he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. it blows my mind. i do not understand it, but man is it relieving. i can not even explain how much i love him. he just never gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. he lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. he has perfect mental health, and i envy it but i am more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. honestly, he is been a saving grace some days. i want to get back in school as soon as possible. i want to know how to build myself back up so that i can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. i do not want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. i want myself back. i struggle so much with feelings of is this worth it? because is it? people would surely miss me, but what about me ? how am i supposed to live if i feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? i wish that i could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. i was so happy go lucky. spunky. happy. i wish i could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. sometimes i get really scared because i have thoughts about dying. i do not want to die and i do not want to commit suicide but what if i become that way to escape the pain? and i go nuts? and i lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? i wouldn t wish depression upon anyone. if you read to here then thank you. and if you have any advice, i am dying to hear it. happy friday.	moderate

why are some people just naturally talented at things, while i am just trash at everything there are people that are naturally talented at art, or math, or coding, are athletic, etc. i have to work really hard, and study really hard in school just to not fail. no matter how hard i try i am always below average. even if i seek tutoring i typically do not do that well. even when i understand the material i fail test. but it just seems like some people can put in minimal effort and be just at perfect at anything.	not depression

i decided that every step counts sometimes your big break in life comes as you wait. not because you re idly waiting, but because you re taking small steps to change as you wait. whether it is being brave enough to put a smile on your face when you do not feel like it, or it is being able to finally fall asleep at am, every small step counts. my dad abandoned us when i was and my mom puts that blame on me, home was and still is a hellhole for me. my ex took her own life a few years back because of her family is bullying and i still can not help but think that i should have done better to support her when i could. i have been battling bed bugs for years and i can not afford to exterminate them, so i sleep in constant physical and mental pain every night. i can not open up enough to build quality friendships because of the trauma of being bullied and betrayed when i was younger. my random anxiety and panic attacks keep me from being efficient at work and it affects me deeply when i burden my team. i have attempted to take my own life plenty of times but failed miserably because the thought of my siblings having to deal with a lost kills me inside. i am not okay and i have been battling depression for god knows how long and i am still fighting it as i write this. but i made the decision to count every small win in hopes that one day, someday, i might get better and just become a better me. i might succeed, i might not. but i decided that i want to try to get better. and i hope that anyone who sees this can try to as well, so that if we do win this war, we would not win this alone.	moderate
lather, rinse, and repeat i have really been a depressive since the age of now . in my late teens, my anxiety became too much to handle and i reluctantly jumped on the psych med merry go round. i used ssris for a couple years and experienced some benefit, though never achieved full remission. due to the emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, among other side effects, i decided to quit. years later, i am still fucked up from the drugs. i suffer from anhedonia, decreased libido, head pressure, among other symptoms. the original anxiety is still present perhaps more so with an additional later of drug induced depression added to the mix. i have been trying to live as normally as possible with thes lasting side effects, but i am effectively faking my way through life. i am in graduate school to kill some time, but i enjoy very little. everything feels full and meaningless. every time i wake up, the first thought is not again. how many times must i repeat this draining, joyless day? they say you have to play the hand you re dealt in life. when is it time to fold?	severe

phone interview in minutes i can feel my anxiety building. i am trying to think of excuses to get out of it. strongly considering not answering and turning my phone off. but i need money. i have been unemployed for a month now. just broke up with my boyfriend last night and nothing seems to matter anymore he was using me and not paying his part of rent . i have no one so why bother trying? why am i even trying to continue to live this pathetic life? i could just finally follow through with killing myself. if i do not pay rent at the end of this month it will only take about a week until the landlord comes knocking. i can put a sign on my bedroom door so she would not have to see my dead body. i do not want to traumatize anyone. i think about these things on a daily basis.	not depression

i hate feeling good for a few days only to feel like shit the next. i really thought i was getting better. i am on mg of zoloft since december and have been seeing a therapist since august who is just an amazing lady. i can not express to you guys how much better these things made me. i exercised almost everyday. i restarted school and a new job and stuck with both i have a horrible history of quitting everything because i just lose the energy and motivation i was so happy. but now, it is the same again. i thought at my new job people actually liked me, but recently just found out everyone is blaming me for everything going wrong drawer shortage, bad review, truck not put away and talk behind my back. i thought i was not that bad....i guess i thought i felt like i belonged. to make matters worse i have a crush on one of the managers. rumor is he is screwing another manager but everyone thinks they are good together so it is okay. last shift i saw him he pretty much bad mouthed me in front of my coworkers and then ignored me the rest of the day. i called in today after having perfect attendance because i did not have the strength to go in. my friend was starting to accompany me to the gym, which turned out to be the stupidest choice ever because all she does is flaunt about how fit she is, making me feel like crap. i do not know if it is the bad weather or not getting to socialize go to school because of the cornavirus. or maybe my meds have stopped working again. i just want to die. i am so sick of everyone acting like they like me until they do not. i am sick of being happy only to feel like shit the next day and laying on thw couch all day just wanting to give up. i just hate this life. i just want something to actually work and actually work full time.	severe

homeless, but not shelterless everyone says being homeless is terrible. i have learned that every situation is different. i am homeless, but not because i made poor financial decisions, or choose drugs and lost everything, or lost my job. i am homeless due to escaping an abusive and toxic environment. i sleep in my car and live out of a storage unit. at first, it was terrible. i was thiscouraged, scared, angry, all the emotions poured through my body. my first night in my car i ended up in the hospital with an extreme panic attack. as time has gone on, i have learned how to adjust, what places are homeless friendly and what ones are not. i see homelessness with new eyes. i still wish that it was not something that is looked so down on and that homeless people were not seen as in the way something that takes up space in society. many homeless people have no shelter and live on the streets. many have mental illnesses and can not afford medication to help them, so to others, they seem dirty and crazed. i am lucky to have my car for my shelter. i have a support system of friends that i met at work that have quickly become family. i have my church family and a few individuals that i met when i first moved here. things could always be worse. but in a sense, i feel very free. it is still hard, but i feel safer in most ways now than i did when i was in the environment i escaped from. i guess my point is this please be kind to everyone, you do not know what they are going through. they may be smiling on the outside, but broken on the inside. trying to do the best they can, but still struggling. we are still people, just down on our luck. 	not depression
i am always the bad guy. always. life seems to enjoy punching me in the face right when i feel like i am getting back on track. it always has. but now, when we re at risk of being snowed in for the second day in a row, and we have no heating or running water, i got called a selfish little shit by my own mother after wanting to stay with my aunt amp uncle for the night. i only want to do that so that my college attendance would not drop and my parents would not have to worry about driving in the snow at am. but no. i am the fucking spawn of satan for making everything about me, apparently. it is no secret she likes my little sister more, but... i thought she would at least changed a little. i was foolish to think that, apparently. someone kill me, please. because i can not move out on my own yet due to having an unsteady job, and i am increasingly tempted to do it myself.	moderate
overwhelmed by how little i feel i have become emotionally numb to the sorts of moments that seemingly used to be exempt from my depression and it is creating this antsy thiscomfort in me during moments like watching the new year is ball drop where i expect to have a brief respite and instead just continue to feel nothing. the emptiness is oddly jarring even though it is a common guest throughout my day to day life. i think that in the past even though i generally had that thistance from everything i would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it is not happening anymore it just sends me into this lost confused state instead like when you re absent mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense.	moderate
got put on and stayed a week in the mental hospital and i do not feel any better. the week was nice, being surrounded by other people who understand, and then i got thischarged yesterday and today i am feeling the same way i did when i got committed. i feel like i will never get out of debt. dollars , in student loans and i have been out of school for years and made every payment on time, trying to pay back an additional dollars , in private loans i used to pay of my credit cards from school because the interest rates were lower, and another dollars , in credit card debt from paying for a wedding and honeymoon i wish i never did, and am currently in the middle of divorcing. now pile on backed up bills that i have not been able to pay like car travels and thousands of dollars of medical bills and then i think i have to pay more if i am going to pick up my meds today and even more for my therapy appointment and even more for my psychiatrist appointment and i can not help but wonder what is the fucking point of it all. i feel eternally stuck. my mdd and gad feel like they were getting better in the hospital but now that i am back home i feel like the suicidal thoughts are coming back. i guess i am just ranting looking for support. my support system is one my husband does not approve of because it is someone i dated a few years ago and he does not approve of my use of marijuana either even though it is legal here. i am behind on bills and i do not feel it will ever get better.	moderate
things just keep getting worse my therapy office is not open over the weekends. i wish i could talk to them today but i can not so i figured coming here might help. i hate everything about myself. it is not irrational hate either its pure and real and justified. i am ugly, small and mediocre at everything i try, even when putting in maximum effort and applying myself over a long period of time. i have no voice and even if i did i have nothing to say anymore. i do not enjoy anything. the only thing that makes me feel anything is my sexuality and i hate that too. i feel it all the time. i am gay and very submissive and it makes me feel weak. i want to be strong but it seems like i am incapable of being that. i do not want to continue on like this and i am tired of trying.	moderate
running out of time i do not have time to talk to anyone about the craziness going on in my life. i actually do not have anyone to talk to either. but do not have time to find a therapist etc. do not have time to make friends and seek support. i wouldn t want to burden people with having a depressed friend anyways. or make friends just because i need them right now. i want people to need want me around.... i do not think anyone needs or wants to deal with a mentally ill person everyday. but people make it seem like understanding or caring about someone else is problems is the hardest thing in the world. they can not empathize or put themselves in others shoes. i never made myself a victim in life even after the countless things i have been through. i was never seeking pity or sympathy from anyone, nor did i want them to care... i just wanted people close to me to understand what i am going through so they could stop adding to my problems. but they do not care and they do not even try to understand what i am going through. they just watch my life falling apart, in silence. yet they expect me to be involved in their drama whenever they need me involved. i can not believe i have been surrounded by heartless, selfish, thoughtless and ignorant humans my entire life. i wish this was not my reality. i wish i could just sleep forever. but i have no choice but to be strong and face it all all because i am a mom and i have a child to live for. i did not plan to be a parent baby was a surprise. fast forward years gt gt i never imagined life would be so difficult for me! now i am tired of pushing through bad times. i am tired of having to be strong. tired of having to fight. but recently it is not only humans affecting me, long term depression has led to procrastination and now time is tic tocking against. life is not for the weak. the race is for those who can endure... but i am not sure i can not take anymore. i tried it, i could not find it and now i just want to get back to me. the peace i had before life became so difficult. i also got hit by a car while crossing at a cross walk years ago and it ruined my life but who fucking cares. if anyone reads this and comments please do not comment saying i am seeking pity or making myself a victim like my sister says i am because i can not take it anymore. i do not want any pity or sympathy, i just wish someone would try to understand what i am dealing with but no one cares or tries to understand. i just want to die bc death seems like the only way for this nightmare to b over. but i have too much to live for. feels like i am being forced to stay living in this shitty world. i try to find new things to love about this planet, thistract myself from the dark side of my life. but i am tired of being fucking optimistic all day everyday . tired of turning the other cheek. all the rage is building up inside of me and i am worried how it will be released. i just do not know what to do anymore. i used to smoke weed to calm down and i do not even want to smoke anymore. nothing seems appealing anymore except death. i know i need to see a doctor but i seriously do not have any fucking time for that. i do not have time for therapy or anything like treatment or recovery. i just want the problems and problematic people to thisappear but that is certainly not possible. i might as well just die	moderate

i am feeling a lot better lately so i posted to this reddit a few days ago wondering what is wrong with my life and what i have to do to fix it. i have spent these past days with my best friend since childhood and got to spend time with two more friends of my close friends. this morning him and i did a pretty extreme session of workouts and we plan to continue it because our schools have closed down for a long time due to the virus going around. i have had the idea of god on my mind a lot more lately. maybe i just needed a purpose and a little going back to my old ways to cure what i could only describe as a phase of depression. things are getting better, they surely are not but i feel so much happier when i spend time with my good friends and get some time away from my family, not that my family is bad of anything, they can just be stressful. i currently have little to no commitments due to the shutdown of things in my city because of the virus and all i have is time, i thought my mental state would deteriorate vastly over this next break, but it is done quite the opposite, i feel so much better. i hope and believe it will continue going this way. i will continue praying and searching for answers of what i can do to fix my mental state even more and search for answers of what i can do to find myself truly happy. i have been visiting my psychologist more lately too and that helps me find those answers. i also think i might have some form of ocd which debilitates me from time to time but i have never been diagnosed or really even talked to anyone about it besides my mom so i do not know? if you have any comments of suggestions they would be much appreciated. feel free to reach out to me in the comments or direct message. i am thinking about trying church out again too, tomorrow morning i plan on visiting a close friend of mine who is in the hospital and is not ever going to recover from his injury, he has been in a vegetative state for years and i just go to be supportive to an extent so do not worry to much about it but hopefully it will put me at rest a little more.	not depression

seems like nothing that i try to do lasts or helps i have been going through a rough patch. i was recently diagnosed with mild depression and gad and have worry reduction group therapy in a few weeks. i do not feel like i have anyone to talk or turn to without feeling guilty or like i am making a meal out of how i am feeling. i try and help people who have more stressful things going on as a thistraction technique but i am now feeling like i should just stop messaging or contacting people because at least then, i will not feel guilty about bothering someone. i have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and i am sleeping less. i tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. i also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but did not notice much difference. i am at a bit of a stand still with regards of what to do. i am not too sure what to expect from writing this or if i will get anything out of it. but i think the anonymity of it helps a little.	moderate

i will never be happy or successful because of past mistakes people say things like forget your past, do not think about your past because you can not change it, etc. this is such bullshit. you will be punished for your entire life because of past mistakes. quiet as a kid? congrats, you re now a socially awkward introvert for life. fat as a kid? you can work out and have a healthy diet but you ll never have a body like people who were never fat. had a drinking or drug problem? you will never get back those lost years and any intelligence health you lost as a result. missed an opportunity? never connected with a possible friend partner? you will never get those chances again. i hate it when people act like you can just pick up from where you are and make things better. people live and they make mistakes. those mistakes change you, they compound and they change your future. it is not true that you can achieve anything. maybe when you re a kid, it is true to an extent, but as soon as you start getting to adolescence, the choices you make start putting you on a track in life, and it is near impossible to get off that track. people fuck up their lives, and there is no way to fix it. you just have to live with the fucked up life forever. a lot of the time there is not really anything you can do other than hope for the best . i see people talk about their sadness and loneliness as reasons for wanting to kill yourself. what about people who feel like they have just made a few too many wrong decisions in the game of life? what are people like that supposed to do? how can you keep living when you know that you will never achieve x, you will never reach your full potential, you will never live your dreams? why live when you have no hope of making things better? why live when you have to cope with all your past mistakes? it is hard to just forget your past and live in the present when that means living with all your fuckups which affect your current situation.	not depression

had a nightmare about suicide i have not had a major depressive episode in three years. when i was depressed, i had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and i will never forget them. lately, i have been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday i had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up. in the dream, it was a sunny day and i was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. there was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and i went to go hang out with them but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious in real life she is not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so i do not know why i conjured this up . she was saying stuff like well when i jump off a bridge this would not matter and everyone was laughing, but i burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and i could not stand the thought of her suffering. to make matters worse, i was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. one of the other people in the group looked at me while i was crying and asked, what is wrong? and i said because none of these people around me will be here after i end my life. then i started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people is parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could have done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. i said to myself i hate thinking about suicide and cried even harder, and then i woke up in the dream but not actually in real life . then after i woke up from that dream into another dream, i was suddenly in my best friend is house traumatized from that dream i had. i was going to see my girlfriend soon, but i was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though i have her. then i actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated. i wanted to tell my friends about the dream i had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so i thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it.	severe

if you want happiness so soon and so bad, you ll end up miserable...and depressed too the title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this if it is not the post will get removed but i want to share this with you a new decade started, and day one i am already in anxiety and i already had a panick attack...why does this matter? well i wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but i have already got a burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career problem...like every time in the last decade in the last decade, i always tried hard to make everything perfect...i never accepted that i had sad moments, that i felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans never ever worked out...i mean i accepted it some times after, but i spent weeks feeling bad because...i wanted happiness, i did not want to feel that way, i did not want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...i did not want to feel that darkness nor to be in it i did not accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...i did not felt anything anymore as i was scared to they tell you things will work out, it will go better than you expected or after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine but i always had low expectations, and most times, i was right to, but still...i wanted to be fine, i wanted the happiness that other people had, that i always considered luckier than me...why was i the one feeling like that? and i got plenty of darker times after other already dark times scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come being broke, parent is death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return the point is that...if you re looking forward to happiness so much like every human being does and has the right too and do not have it, you ll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you ll end up numb that is something we all know right? yeah pretty much...but we do not realize that often when we still are not mentally ill, but we re not exactly ok either, we need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent is not going to buy it...is not it better to give up and accept they would not have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not going to change after all, the parent would not buy it but the kid may have that toy one day if he she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be hard work for it the kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his her parents at least but if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever you got to accept you re miserable now you got to accept that life has been unfair you got to accept that you should have done smth more you got to accept that that was all what you could have done you gott accept that things are like this you got to accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things did not happen to people like you right now... but do not search for a light that does not shine, because it would not shine just because you want it to...too brutal? sorry if it is is not it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can not and there is nothing wrong with it , please, find someone that can take you by the hand sadness and pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they will overwhelm you for good happiness does not...we have to search for it, but we got to have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps i wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...i can not tell you when you ll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but i hope you truly find them...i hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death life sucks, i know, i wish bad things did not happen...i wish i did not feel like this it is not just the burecrautic problem...there is more ...but it is like this now and sometimes...and we got to accept it...we got to accept we feel bad, we got to acept we need help too to feel good... i know that this is not the main cause for depression...i am here talking this nonsense while some of you are deep down in despair and do not believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can not or are unable too...will badly affect people that are not depressed yet i know that this message would not change much...but i still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it would not be just this horrible feeling if we could even call it like that 	moderate
feeling especially detached and lonely today while i travel. i have been feeling especially detached from my self and really lonely today. i have been traveling for work and i am alone and away from my family, friends and so. my job requires me to travel often and sometimes i find myself feeling further away from myself and hard to ground myself. i have had depression, anxiety and derealization depersonalization for almost half my life so for the most part i have learned how to cope and function the best i can. today is one of those days where these feelings are hitting me hard and i am feeling very lost. i worked a hour week and on thursday it all started to catch up to me the sleep deprivation, anxiety and stress. usually being at work helps thistract me from those feelings of detachment and loneliness but i started feeling more anxious and out of my body and became very aware of it. it became hard to talk to other people because i would feel like it was not me who was talking in the middle of my sentences and then start focusing on those thoughts instead of the present moment. i do not get to go home until the end of this week and i am having some trouble coping. i do not know how i am going to get through this week if i keep feeling this way especially in the workplace. i am feeling really lonely, far away from everyone especially during this state of panic where all my friends get to work from home and these feelings are escalating. there is a feeling in my chest that just feels really down and i want to cry right now. it is starting to affect my mental state as well as how i function at work. would greatly appreciate any advice or words of comfort. tldr traveling for work this week has started to take a toll on me and i am feeling very depressed and away from myself and everything around me.	moderate
anyone else wish they could fall into a coma? i do not like life very much right now. there is a lot of problems i have which have no real possible answer, and my favorite thing to do is sleep because it numbs my brain from stuff like this. i do not want to kill myself, i do not want to cause any thistress like that to my family, so i wish i could just slip into a coma one way or another. i just need, any sort of extended break from reality, holy fuck. sleep is a nice break, but it does not last long at all. i am only i do not have it nearly as bad as most others here do, i apologize. but just, nothing feels special about life anymore. things are kind of difficult now, but looking at the future, it only looks like things are going to get even more difficult, and that is something i wish i could veer away from, but it does not look like that is within my power. i do not want to die, i am scared of finding out what is on the other side, but stuff like sleep and comas are pretty much as close as one can get to being dead without actually dying as far as i am aware. thanks for reading my vent, i hope you have a great day.	moderate

i am so god damn tired.... hello... the title, basically. i should probably use a throw away but i do not care anymore. i am going to warn this is mostly me bitching and whining, i am really not that interesting. to start, last year, my mom and cat died the same month. my cat actually died the week of my mother is funeral. i was very, very close with her. she was he entire reason i went to college for a degree. my cat was there for me since i was a little kid, losing her was like losing a piece of myself... before i had a brain injury. she was all that was left to tie me to normality. sure you could argue nobody is normal, but that is not easy to hear when you re bullied relentlessly for being weird. i actually had to leave high school it got so bad. to top all this shit off, i got denied thisability for the second time, so now i have to wait another two years just to fucking hear no again. i submitted two fucking banker boxes of my medical problems, two! i also need to deal with voc rehab since they helped me but i can not fucking work with my thisability, i have shadowed two different jobs and failed horribly. i barely finished college despite my longest day being hours, with two of that being a break period. i feel useless and hopeless. i am , poor, and draining my bf of his money. i just want to sleep and not wake up. or have cybernetics let me have a cyborg body so my muscles and nerves are not as weak and painful as an year old. i am not going to do anything, mostly because i do not even have the energy to attempt. but i am also stuck in hell of struggling to sleep despite being exhausted all the time. i wish i was normal, i wish i was not a fucking leach on society. i want to help so fucking bad but every doctor i have seen has said i can not work. anxiety on phone, can not do simple math, have a seizure thisorder so lots of places would not want to hire me for that risk, they just have to claim something else to not be sued can not drive, and can not lift more than lbs. i also have pathetically low stamina, like the walk to my mail box wears me out. yet the judge thinks i can fucking work. ...who knows, maybe i just have a victim complex. i know i have tried, but it still feels like i did not try hard enough, that i am a failure, useless. this is with me on two different anti depressants that for the most part work, i am sure without them... well... idk. it wouldn t be good. i am sorry mom, i am a fucking failure. your support was for nothing....	severe

you have got to follow your gut. i have been told for such a long time that i need to do what is right for me and follow your gut but i have never been able to determine what that was. this morning i was supposed to go on a dream trip, singapore to vietnam to japan then back home. i should probably preface that with i also recently returned back from seeing my recently divorced parents for christmas found out my dad now has a kid with a woman my age and i have been a wreck. for a lot of reasons that i would not go into, but it was just the icing on the cake. ever since i got back from seeing my parents i have been breaking down, maybe it is because i finally opened up to my mom about some of the sexual abuse i endured as a child, i am not sure. anyway, everyday has been just hell. constant racing thoughts, feeling like offing myself was the only way to cope, drugs, you name it and i have been there. anyway, i got to the airport, went through security and arrived at my gate. as soon as i was about to board i lost it again, just broke down. something in me was telling me what i was doing was wrong. after wiping away my tears i told the boarding agent i needed someone to get my bag off the plane and that i could not go anymore do to personal reasons, i then proceeded to break out crying again. but as soon as i left and i got back home my whole mood did a . it is so hard to explain but walking away just felt right. i have not been this happy in a long time. i was so worried leading up to the trip about this and that and then having every bad memory from my childhood come up over christmas, i was just in a terrible space. it is so wild toe that i can be feeling this good about losing all that money, not experiencing the world, letting those down who knew i was going on the trip, none of that matters because i finally know what it feels like to listen to your gut and intuition. i know that was probably all over the place but i am sober and happy and feeling optimistic about life. i hope everyone here can find that feeling, lord knows i have been searching for it for a long time. listen to your gut i guess, anxiety can be your friend if you let it. everyone deserves happiness, just stick in there long enough to find it!	moderate

vent good day. i just thought i would vent here to see if it would even remotely help. i have been dealing with depression for over half a year now. it started when my grandmother is health began to rapidly deteriorate because of cancer. she passed away exactly half a year ago. it broke my heart she was a second mother to me. raised me, was always at my side during the most important events of my life and would never stop being proud of me. a month and a half later, i lost an equally important person my first romantic partner because of sins of a sexual nature. we made a promise to abstain from such themes, but kept failing and i am the one to take most of the blame for it. they have cut all communication save for a few, very minor interactions. i even lost all of my friends, save for a couple of them, in the span of a week. as it stands, i am deeply depressed and do not seem to be making much, if any, progress. i used to try to be as devoted a christian as i could, but i have even let go of my faith. i have an immense amount of hate inside of me. hate towards myself for not being able to overcome this sadness, even when i am going to a psychiatrist. for making my parents who are aware of this situation and the few friends i have left worried. for all the mistakes i made and keep making. hate towards the fact that my grandmother had to leave us. i do not even know if i hate the person i broke up with or the fact that they left me in such an apparently easy way in a couple of moments. hell, i know for a fact that they have been better off since the breakup. hate towards sadness itself. nowadays, most of the things i feel are either sadness, anger or guilt. the worst part is, i have convinced myself that i deserve this, that i should not be happy, that i should remain depressed, so on and so forth. my parents keep saying that i will have a bright future, or that i will grow up to be a good person. it is the same thing my grandmother and ex used to say. i feel as though it makes things worse. i try to be sympathetic and understanding towards everyone else, but i can not do so the same effect as before given all of my problems. i also try to pull myself together for the sake of my parents and younger brother, but i never succeed. i wish they would let me die. the combination of being tossed aside, losing my friends and more has made me feel worthless. i am an incredibly miserable conglomerate of depression, hate and guilt and i can not see things getting any better. i sincerely believe myself to be a lost cause, and that the best, most straightforward solution to this whole predicament is to end it all. i could shoot myself, overdose on any pills i find, jump in the middle of the road... the list goes on. i am impossibly tired all the time. i have lost interest in stuff i used to like. i do not even feel like i am living. come to think of it, i can not find a point or reason behind writing this. it did not even make me feel any better. sorry if this made you worried. i wish you the best.	not depression
how can i cheer up i feel like my friends which i have known for most of my life have become tired of me because i am hyperactive. i have found out they have had a number of plans without me and i feel like they just do not like me anymore. feeling this, i tried to make new friends, but the same thing happened even quicker with them. i have found a friend group now who are nicer and for now, do not thislike me. my mum can see i am depressed sometimes and she thinks it is because i spend my weekends indoors on technology because i never get invited to anything , so she tries tirelessly to get me out the house and to try something new. however, most of these things i find very boring or not something i would like to do, and she gets upset and angry at me because she thinks i would rather spend all my time indoors and i am depressed because of it. this is not true, as i am completely fine with being at home for a day, or having no friends. what i can not bare is not knowing if my friends really like me or not. my mum like i am sure many others do drags me to these places i would rather not be, as she thinks it is in my best interests. not wanting to go to many of these places, i often act sad and negative when we go, which ruins it for her and makes her feel upset. i hate for my mum to feel sad, though i physically can not have a positive attitude to these things i can not cheer up even if i want to. the same thing happens every weekend she talks to me about this new place she wants to take me, i commonly reject it, she begs me to come out, i either go or i do not, but either way she ends up becoming sad and not enjoying her day. i feel like a failure and a thissapointment, as i have lost all my hobbies to my sadness. summary i feel like my mum does not understand my problems and thinks it is because i do not get out, when really it is my social issues. i tell her this, but she insists that going out is the best way to help, which i know it is. when she tries to find something to do i often thislike it or do not want to go, which puts me in a low mood as i am being forced to do something i do not want to, and this ruins whatever we plan to do or are doing for my mum. i know this sounds incredibly chilthish but it is making me feel incredibly shit and i want a way out. thank you for reading this	moderate
i am just down. i have not gotten out of bed since thursday. except to drink water and use bathroom. i have been mostly sleeping and binge watching bones. i have not been to work. i am not sad, just feel down and empty. i have not taken any of my sleeping meds. mostly because my t asked if i have been taking them more than normal and i said no. and i do not want it to lie to her. i am a shit mom. since i did not go to work the least i could do is go to my kid is game. but he is at his dad is and i can not find the motivation to go see it. i am dejected and tired. i want to go outside, but i should be at work, and should not be elsewhere. so i am home. i want to just take off and drive somewhere, like i have done before. but i have to be in class monday night and it is a class i can not miss for my program. i am broke af and i am tired of working so hard to barely stay afloat. i am trying to be okay but i am so not okay right now. i can not keep my days and times straight and this week has just been exhausting. i can not hear my music like i used to and it makes me angry and frustrated and i have no escape. i just want everything to be over. i just wish i had some support outside t, and wish i had friends. i am tired of always initiating contact. nobody contacts me. except when they want something. i wish people would say hi or something once in a while. i am just empty today.	moderate

i do not know where i am heading life is just getting too hard, i feel weak. unable to do anything anymore. i am so unsure of everything and i do not feel myself. getting out of bed has become way too hard, i always feel tired even if i get enough sleep, i feel like i have lost all sense of reality i am really struggling. about a month ago my best friends dad passed away and it was extremely hard for me in all honesty. she had to move in with us and being an only child it feels like it has changed my life completely, i feel like i am stuck and so much is being put on me. the more and more we talk to the more thistant i feel to the world and i am struggling to come to terms with it. a couple months ago me and my ex broke up and i feel like i have lost my soulmate i feel so useless and worthless a lot of the time like there is no point in my existence. like who would care anyway? i left the house today without anyone knowing and i just walked and walked until i just completely broke down, i was just sitting there so helpless. what really is the point, i eventually went back home but i am just not feeling the same anymore can anyone please help me? this really sucks 	moderate

does anyone else struggle with empathy? too much or too little? for a long time now i have felt a sense of detachment from the people i know. there are probably only five people in my life that i consistently feel empathy for, otherwise it is like they are strangers. i feel callous and selfish but i always think that realistically they do not care about me either. it just feels performative when something bad happens and everyone reacts with horror just because it is what you should do. does the cousin i have seen once in the past year actually care about me? what about the brother i did not grow up with? why should i care about these people? why do not i feel anything for them? but then i consistently feel intense empathy for absolute strangers. i will watch the news and a brief mention of our local homeless population will bring tears to my eyes, or i will see a video on reddit of a man listening to his dead son is heartbeat and start openly crying. it is not just strangers either, i feel overly empathetic toward fictional people, too. i will feel gutted for days after i read or watch anything even a little sad. i feel like there is this persistent malaise in my life and i can not care about anything that is real. everything feels fake and it does not matter. the only thing that matters is the constant daydream.	moderate

hating what i used to love i do not know if this is the right place to post about this, but i thought i would give it a shot. i have been an artist my whole life, ever since i can remember. i went through many years of art school, and while studying i was doing well. art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and i have always wanted to be an artist more than anything else. but i have also had mental health issues my entire life, and i have gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. i have been medicated since i was a child, so that is helped most of the time. but now, starting last autumn, i have gone into a depressive period that is a bit different than the previous ones. i think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. i did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so i think burnout is very likely. in any case, i started to notice that i did not enjoy drawing anymore. drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. it started to feel like way too much work and that work was not interesting or exciting. the work was also difficult and just so much. so many lines. honestly, when i think about drawing i start to feel physically unwell. i have been advised to take a break from drawing, and i am doing so. i have not actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and i am going for one month. i am just so terrified that i will never enjoy drawing again. i can not even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. but i still want to be an artist so much. plus, i honestly do not have any other hobbies unrelated to art that i could focus on. nothing else really interests me. i should also mention that i am switching medications right now, and i am about to go onto a full dose of my new medication which is actually one that is worked for me in the past . i have never experienced anything like this, and i am so scared. any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.	severe
there is nothing worse than being a year old male virgin why? because when you have some kind terminal illness people atleast have sympathy for you. when you are a year old male kissless virgin people are just thisgusted by you, they will think you re an incel. people do not take you seriously, they can not comprehend the immense pain male virgins like me have to go through everyday. if they knew, they would have more respect for people like me. but instead all people can do is mock male virgins, society does not listen to male virgins their problems and their feelings. all they do is make us feel more insecure and inferior. society just wants male virgins like me to die a painful death, dying of a heart attack because of the constant emotional pain.	not depression
i will kill myself within days i will turn this tuesday. i gave myself enough time. nothing happened. i have tried reaching out and seeking help. people do not really care. even if they say they do, they never show it in action. i posted another cry for help on reddit before with another account but moderators deleted it for no reason before someone even replies. i have tried therapy, psychiatrists did not help. in fact, opening up to people actually made it worse. i just want people to consider my mental condition and treat me better instead of giving me advice. but at least after therapy i know that i have autism, psychotic depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, ocd, maladaptive daydreaming thisorder and borderline personality thisorder. i think i have thissociative identity thisorder. i know what is happening when one of my other personalities is controlling me, but i have no control over what thay say or what they do. one of my psychiatrists said i am just too schizophrenic . i can not communicate with people. i can not have long lasting friendships. i have never felt loved and i do not even know what it means or feels like. i do not feel empathy or sympathy. i gave myself time to think about this. i realized something i do not want to just end the pain, i do not want to live. i am tired of waking up and trying to survive the day just to do the same repetitive things that i do everyday. i do not want a job, i do not want money, i do not want to graduate. i seriously do not want anything from life. but that is not the worst part. i live in iran. in iran when guys turn they have to go to military academy for years or you can keep graduating and then go to military academy after you re done, but it is a rule and you can not escape from it . i can not even imagine years without my pc. after all it is one of the things that kept me alive. i wish i could live in another country, but that needs a lot of money and i have to take ielts test and go to military academy anyway. otherwise i am stuck here. hold on a second... if i live in another country i need a job, so it would be pointless. the other thing that kept or maybe keeps me alive is my daydreaming. real life is very boring and repetitive. if i could live in my daydreaming forever, it would be nice. something like a different world which i could live in. people in my daydreams are all fictional characters and i like them more than real life people. that is why i can not just quit it and go find real friends. they actually helped me a bit with their emotional support. there is no other way. nothing will change if i stay alive, and i can not change anything myself. no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i want it, the story of my life does not have a good ending. i wanted to give myself more year, but that is just pointless. i will kill myself on my birthday. now do not tell me i have so much to live for, everything will be okay, it will end someday. tell me whatever you think is actually helpful. only if my post would not be deleted like before.	severe

people say they want to listen but never really do nobody really listens when i try to say what is going on. and even when someone says that they do want to listen they just brush off everything that i say. sharing what i am going through and what i am feeling is hard enough but when that happens then i do not want share anymore even after their further prompting. it hurts. it forces me to bury what i feel deep inside. people say they listen but they do not. they ask for me to reword it when i am saying exactly what i am feeling. they tell me that what i am feeling is not really what i said but how do they know? how can you tell me what i am feeling if you re you and i am me? that is not how it works. it just makes me feel more like an alien and a freak.	moderate

so lost and confused with myself. never usually reach out for help, but i have gotten to a point in my lifei amjust so lost..... in the years of life that i have lived, i have been through hell after hell. now, dont get me wrong, there are probably millions of people that have it worse off than i do. its just that after constantly being crushed down, manipulated, abused, and more recently having your only kid taken away for no reason. i have had depression for the majority of my life. being put on drugs as a kid, beaten when out of line, bullied in every single school i went to and there were quite a few because my parents moved around alot growing up so never really had a set school. never had my first relationship till which lasted for a year and a half. she broke up with me after beating me in a hotel room, and when i went to cops with pics, texts, evidence out the arse, etc., they too laughed at me becausei ama man. nd relationship i was cheated on for the entirety of the months with her best friend . the last one i had was just over a year. lived together before we started dating, ended up feeling she was the one and proposed never really liked marriage but for her i wanted it she then got pregnant with my only child and has, since nd month of pregnancy, made my life miserable and broke me in ways i can not even explain really, really long story of manipulation, heart break, and trauma . including all of my family life, personal life, relationship life, i have never been the one for revenge, or wishing death upon anyone. ive always been the give you the shirt off my back kind of person, even if i dont know you. i always treated everyone family, friends, lovers, strangers with my utmost respect and always did everything i could in between to have a good life and be happy but its gotten to a point now where everything around me has crumbled down and i have a pain and emptiness inside of me i have never had before. i honestly feel so lost and feel my life is slipping away and nothing i do or try to do is pulling it back. if you read this novel of a life story i wrote, i really do appreciate it, and any advice or tips i can get to shine some light on this never ending darkness would be very helpful. again, thank you so much for taking the time, i know it was alot lt 	not depression

anyone struggling might find this helpful, so here it is no theory or claim in this letter is based on scientific fact or has been in any way proven. the theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. as an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. one main misconception about curing depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. happiness does not have a formula. any doctor that claims to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your time. many non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. i am not an exception. i attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and i am doing well in school. but i also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. i cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when i wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? naturally, given my well off parents, i received every treatment therapy you could imagine in my quest to shake my depression. none of it had any effect. i continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. my depression got to the point where i was not even sure if i liked my intermediate family anymore. one day, i snapped. i just left. not for long, only about hours, but in those hours, i learned more about the way life works than i had in my previous years. in those hours i learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you you know what is best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. when it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. this is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. they are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. but this is the exact opposite for the brain. every brain on planet earth is thistinct and unique. i would describe the brain using the theory. of the human brain is a result of evolution. we all have the same survival instincts and similar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. this area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything normal humans do. your is what makes you human. however, it is the of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. your is who you are, what separates you from other humans. ideally, individuals will let their loose and really express who they are. this is unfortunately very far from reality. as i have pointed out and will continue to, society is not good for the individual. society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are better than someone. due to the competitive side that exists in the , societal expectations take control over your , hindering you from truly being you. more on the process of taking control of your below. i am still developing my craft as a writer and could not find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here is a really awkward and out of place sentence. social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you do not meet these expectations. for the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. it did not occur to me until my sophomore year i had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point of college what if i do not want to meet these expectations? for some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, sometimes even family. i understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but i promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you would not care about other peoples opinions of you. the people who truly care about you will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life. it is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. take the risk to be your own person. own your . the big takeaways good happy happiness are all relative terms. just because something makes you happy, does not mean it will make someone else happy. this one is more directed at parents. i understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit i am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise . that being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as i have, they are old enough to start formulating their own decisions. if your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he she wants to pursue, not what you want him her to pursue or what you think he she should pursue. i am not saying step completely out of his her life, but as your child matures, it is important to take more of an advisor type role. as tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them. you know what is best for you. do not be afraid to pursue what you love to do. own your . again, this letter is from personal experience and everything said does not necessarily apply to everyone, or anyone for that matter. i have struggled through depression and feel like sharing this experience could potentially help out other individuals, so here it is. any questions, feel free to comment!	moderate

choosing a date is so liberating i thought long and hard about this. very long. i have had hours sleep in the last two days. in that amount of time i have come to the conclusion that no matter what i do, no matter how i fight my demons, or how much progress i make. i will never have what i want and need, never. i do not understand why i am being looked down on for making a choice. someone once said that we all have choices, and we re adults free to make them. so, my choice is to not have my current life as i know it. it is so hard to explain to people what exactly i feel. i have tried, but what is the point? there is a million possible ways my life could turn out. everyone keeps saying you know, you could be this you could live there or work here blah blah fucking blah. like, i do not care if there is better days ahead. there is not to me. i have my memories. and that is it. there is no better day to come because i have had them all already, not including some other major life events. i would not have them. i would not have children, or a house. or a marriage, or a car. i will just have what ifs and what could have beens. i am not prepared to give up on what i, what we had planned. i am just not. i mentally and physically can not let go. i never ever ever will and nothing else will come close to them, nothing. i can not live a lie and i am not sure i can continue on in the state that i am in. my entire life changed nearly a year ago. i have always been a bad person, with a flame inside of me. i worked hard and long to get that as little as possible, and under control. i really did. i was still flawed but the flame was at least manageable. but then fuel was dumped on it and i have not been able to put it out since then, and gotten to used to fuelling it myself. it is grown bigger than me. i have had my reasons to be on this earth, i have had my goals, my plans, my purpose, my love. had. someone tell me, what is it your supposed to do when they all slip away and thisappear? just, dust yourself off and move on? has anyone considered even for a second that i can not, but more importantly do not want to move on? time heals all wounds? what if you know deep down in your heart and fucking rotten soul that this, this path i have to walk down will not heal this? as i said, sure it might scab over but then i would be an imposter. and i would pick at that scab untill i am old and worn out. i just can not do it. if i could fix the things i have done, i would. i just wish i knew how. but i can not. some things are unfortunately permanent. so, the way i see it, i will continue on untill that date comes around. i will do everything in my power to fix my fucked up brain, to ask the questions i need to ask, why i am like this, what could i do to change. i will try to live a bit, do the right things, see beauty in the world. except it would all just be hollow. and fake. empty. but once that date comes around it is just the time for me. it is my time to make my choice. i can not live a lie. i wish people could understand.	moderate
just can not seem to get my shit together. everytime i think i have finally got the motivation to do go towards my goals and do the things i wanted i end up relapsing and hating myself more than ever. i really think i am a pussy for not doing things that i can easily get over with and want to do but something keeps holding me back. that something is the fact that i am a scared pussy. i do not have the balls to do lots of things and i hate myself for it. sometimes i really can not help myself and i feel really down about it. i am just not happy with who i am, and maybe it is down to insecurity, but i do not know how to change that. i try but i always end up relapsing back to my shameful habits of being lazy and whatnot. and it is been like this for so long, it is like i am at a standstill in life, where nothings going on, and i am just waiting for something to happen. meanwhile the time is flying and i am still here.	moderate

how do you trust your therapist? it is always been hard for me to trust and for good reasons too. the problem i have with therapy is that your conversation is not confidential. they say it is but it is not. i can not talk about my suicidal thoughts or self harm otherwise they are forced to release my records and have me hospitalized. the government is allowed to ask for the records of my conversation if they wish too at any time i know it might sound stupid to some of you but what if they do ask for it ?! i do not want them to know . am i just too fucked up for therapy ?! am i supposed to carry all my thoughts with me until i die or better yet kill myself?	severe
robots just a thought. life feels robotic. living feels mechanical and draining. the ritualistic process carried from one day to another. lately, the tampering sadness in me is starting to swallow me alive. routines set for healthy habits turns into empty altruism. i feel empty. listening to most songs can overrun my mind, bringing back the old cherishing memories i have taken for granted. i can not help but miss the sweet, simple childhood i have had but was taken for granted. daring to reach adulthood only to feel at a loss with life and all it has to offer. i have only reached the first steps of adulthood but have never felt more strained and overwhelmed as each day passes. forcing myself to get up, make the bed, and thistracting myself through self made chores have became numbly overbearing. all the energy i have pushed towards every hour of the day starts to drain quicker as days began to pass and months start to slip. here, a new year. another round of my robotic lifestyle. what more is there to an empty life?	moderate

have not hung out with anyone in months as the title says. last time i hung out with someone was in late september . i have tried to talk to people and ask others to do stuff like grab lunch, but literally every single time i either get brushed off, ghosted, or given obvious excuses like oh uh well i am just so busy the next few weeks . no one ever reaches out to me first and tries to ask me to do stuff, either. if i am not the one reaching out and asking, then no one ever says anything at all. people say to reach out to others and those that care will come to you, but that literally never works. either everyone forgets i exist when i am not in their direct line of sight, or they explicitly go out of their way to avoid me. how am i supposed to get over this crushing loneliness, as some people say, when no one is ever willing to help me through it? it is gone on so long that i just feel tired. i spend every day thinking about how unwanted i am compared to everyone else around me.	not depression

depressed ex sending weird signals so after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after i ghosted her boring message, i texted my ex telling her i cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. she replied with a yeah well you too i did not reply. later in the day she sent me a snapchat telling me she was drunk new years eve nothing else interesting though. i was like yay have fun, and we did not talk the rest of the night she is in europe rn i am in the states . i did not send her a happy new years or anything when it turned midnight here. in the morning i woke up to a happy new years, and all the best for you! i replied with a thanks and you too . no other text communication although i replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. i am confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said could not feel anything, and later said she could not love me or anyone else right now. i find it kind of weird she would include the lovey emoji, she does not use them much and it is just something i feel an ex wouldn t send to someone they broke up with. she is also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad i ghosted her understandable and has never been the type to double text or contact first. any thoughts? i am not desperate to get back together, i know maybe she is just trying to be nice and be friends i am not interested in a platonic friendship, i will be nice and talk sometimes but i am not going to be friendzoned but i feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something.	moderate

i am just done with this sh t. man i do not get the point of this life. why are we born? why is our earth not like other planets just cold and silent. i just want to be alone and cry until i dehydrate and die. i actually do not want to die at least not yet. i want to give this a try for like years. the main thing i want wanted to achieve in this life was to make my parents proud but i hate studies and apparently that is the only way to keep them happy. both my parents have said that i am a failure and my mom just straight up said to my grandmother that it is a thisgrace i was born in this family. and they said all this because i got above average or actually pretty good marks in some very important exam. i actually worked quite hard for it and after the exams were over i took a break of months from the studies. maybe they said all that bad stuff cause they were angry but it is too late now. the thing that hurts me the most is that neither of them have still said you did good. infact other family relatives have said that. because of this thing happening to me i lost all my ambition of doing something and now do not study anything and there are chances i might fail. because they just want me to study i do not go out with my friends that much. rarely like once in months. because of this i do not have any very very good friends. do not get me wrong i have many friends i care about them just not that best friend experience. the only person i truly love is my sister. like she might just be the reason i am not dead yet because thinking that she will cry makes me cry. now if the next years do not show any changes i might just end it all man. i have never opened up about all this to anyone before because i just think that there are actual bad things happening to people and my am getting sad over small and petty things. at this point i am just a waste on this earth. i am always happy and keep making jokes in front of my friends so they do not even suspect a thing. i just want to turn back time dude enough of this sh t. sorry if this is too long. i am talking about all this for the first time and if you read this here i deeply care about you. haha jokes even if you did not read i care about you. i probably forgot to write something and maybe this will get buried in the depths of the internet but the countdown has started for .	moderate

hit back hard been feeling really shit lately and i feel like i have no one to depend on which makes me feel even shittier because if i feel guilty about wanting to depend on someone. i have been depressed since i was or , i am now. there have been highs and lows and especially now it just keeps changing. i could be happy for a while only to get really depressed for the while after. i have noticed i have been getting really dark i would rather be dead thoughts lately, something which i have not had in a long time. i used to cut myself but i stopped and i do not feel the need to do it again but sometimes it comes into my head and it makes it worse. i have tried antidepressants setraline mg but i had to stop taking them before they fully kicked in because i could not function in school. but without them i can not function at school anyway because everyone seems to annoy me and i just would rather be home in bed asleep. i have also tried counselling more than once but it did not help. i could not seem to open up at all and at the last therapist i seen i started crying because of how uncomfortable i felt because i could not open up, i wanted, even needed to talk to someone and i was pushing myself to do so for weeks but it did not change anything. i find that odd though because i seem to be able to open up with my friends, depends on what type of mood i am in but i would always at least say something about how i was feeling. i do not know what is wrong with me and i do not know what to do but i just want it to stop, i want to be genuinely happy and to stop all the shit that is in my head. sorry for this, needed to rant to try feel a better.	moderate
i want to cut out all human contact from my life but i can not figure out how. my dad keeps fucking bugging me every couple weeks by calling me and tries to plan out lunches and shit. i pay for myself i at least try to pretend that i like to talk to him. during a conversation i mentioned i am trying to figure out how to move out of my aunts house and he said so you can smoke pot and drink all day without being bugged now, as someone that is actively seeking out therapy and days under my belt without drinking, that just fucking crossed the line for me. i need to figure out how to get away from all family, humans, everybody. just when i think someone might be okay or they might understand or whatever, they always say rude things and they will never actually understand. fuck i am quitting my job because there is too much human contact. i am also afraid of becoming homeless because you need to talk to humans in order to survive.. i do not know what i am going to do. the only time i do not mind talking to people is when i am drunk because i can take the blows then.	not depression
coronavirus is ruining my life at the moment i live in the us, and the whole country is basically on lockdown. my family and i have already started on quarantining and everything to stay safe, and i hope everyone on the sub stays safe and healthy. how this relates to my depression is that i have to stay cooped up in my house and i do not know when it will end. i normally go and see a counselor to help me with things that are bothering me, and he really helps me to get back on a good path, and now with everyone having to stay home, i can not do that. also, my school is out because of the outbreak, and so i can not even see my friends, and i normally talk to them about stuff like sports and music to try to take my mind off stuff, and it helped me in really rough times. other than that, in general has been a never ending circle of shit, as i went through a depressive state for a month and a half, which saw my grades drop off massively which caused even more stress in the family, and only a week ago, one of my closest friend is mother died, which put me even further into a hole, and now the coronavirus outbreak and having to isolate myself is the icing on the cake for me. i am not trying to feel sorry for myself or have a pity party in any way, i just want somebody to talk to about this, and i just want things to be normal again in my life.	not depression

i am so tired of being sad. my job told me my performance was getting terrible, and i eventually broke down in front of my boss and told them i struggle with depression. my depression has been so bad lately and it has started to interfere with work, so i understand why they had to talk to me. i just hate i can not live a normal life. i try so hard to focus and concentrate but sometimes my brain would not let me. i am in therapy now and on medication so i am hoping to be better soon, i just wish i did not have to thisclose this to my job. i wanted to pretend to be normal but every day it was getting harder to do so. i did not want to seem like i was not trying, because i really was. my boss was understanding and offered to help in anyway they can, but i can not help but worry that now they view me as a weak employee and will somehow want to fire me. i am trying my hardest to be okay and it is so hard. i wish other people could truly understand what it is like to deal with all of this inside your own head. do not really know why i am writing this, i just feel so weak and embarrassed to have had to explain this at my job. i guess i am just overwhelmed that my secret is out. i really hope i can bounce back better than i ever have before.	moderate
thinking of whats going to happen if i even recover from my depression in the future almost makes me sick of trying to get better in a hypothetical situation, i do get better and i survive. what next? i had to drop out of school because i was so sick. its been like over years. starting over is almost impossible. ive been going up and down for so long that knowing ill be in a state in which i feel ok but theres nothing to do, ill just be depressed again. my hypothetical future seems nothing i want to heal over. whats the point. my therapist always mentioned the joke of how many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb? just , but only if the lightbulb wants to get changed. . like how about this. fuck it.i amthe lightbulb and i dont want to be changed anymore. its all so pointless.i amat a dead end. fuck life.	moderate

i want to die and do not want help i do not know what the point of this post is, random people can not really help with the issue. i have been depressed since around , started taking meds at and stopped at . i am about to turn . in those years i have wanted to die, to kill myself. i visualize it happening and ever since i was it felt like it was destined to happen. i still think this way. i was closed off and alone my whole life, i have no social skills and can be pretty emotionally unstable if i do not put walls up and just be indifferent to everything. this helped me avoid too many suicidal ideations in high school, but when i went to college i resolved to talk to a therapist and psychiatrist, and be open and try to make my empty life less empty. it failed, the meds did not help. i was being emotionally open and connected with people, made some friends and even a boyfriend and lost them all due to my intense mood swings and bouts of suicidal actions. i tried to kill myself twice in then dropped out of college because i missed so much class from hospitalizations. i shut off and i am back to being empty and not interacting with people. i can not do it. i have no support network, i need to be alone and sad because it is more stable and less dangerous than the alternative. as i realized this and started taking classes online, i know i will kill myself in years if i continue this way. i want to get some job, move away so my parents do not find the body, and work up the nerve to do things right this time. every few months i feel this want to die or to cease to exist become stronger and i am doing nothing to fix it. do i even want help? do i think i can be helped? i do not know anymore. all i know is that trying to get better made things so much worse, i do not have a stable enough support network to try that again. truthfully no one thinks about me and no one cares to talk with me, i have actively isolated myself and done a job. does it stop? can it even stop if i do not do something different? i can not would not do anything different so am i just going to keep daydreaming about dying as it becomes more and more of a reality? i am pathetic and a lost cause, and i wish every night that i just would not wake up. i deserve to be dead, the only thing i am worthwhile as is worm food. as dumb and bad as it sounds, i either do not want help or think i deserve help can be helped. so that is it. one day hopefully soon i will pass without fanfare or a note and no one will even notice.	severe

negative lexapro reaction my psychiatrist recently prescribed me lexapro. a few hours after taking it for the first time, i suffered a major panic attack while driving home from work. i was convinced i was having a heart attack based on my symptoms, which were chest pains pressure on my abdomen, pins amp needles in my arms, difficulty breathing, cold sweats, and tunnel vision. i pulled over to call , and spent the night in the hospital. i did not know if this was because of the medication at first, so i continued taking it for a few days after, but i kept experiencing similar side effects. i decided to stop taking it until i spoke to my psychiatrist again. has anyone here experienced anything similar with this medication?	severe

i was high. what can i say? so this is what i wrote whilst stoned on cannabis i share with you something that have complexed and swamped my mind for years. what is life with happiness? happiness is defined as the state of being happy. , but what does happy mean? happy is defined as feeling or showing pleasure or contentment. . showing pleasure? but how is pleasure shown? what is pleasure ? why is it the fundamental lining of life itself? why is it the one thing we desire the most but fail to gain successfully? pleasure is expressed and described as the way our brain expresses enjoyment, excitement and exploration. therefore, most addictions are caused by pleasure. surely then life is an addictions since it is caused and causes pleasure? with this theorem, i can give you an answer to the truly unanswerable question, what is life? . my answer, life is an addiction which causes pleasure amongst its beings. life is not alive and has no achievable goal. it is purely a means of giving meaning to other beings. by not having pleasure or happiness , you are simply a being without meaning. therefore, you should make everything pleasurable and express everything as happiness because life is an addiction that can not be overcome. therefore, it must be controlled. 	not depression

if you have to love yourself before you love someone else, then looks like i am going to be lonely i broke up with my girlfriend months ago. when i was with her it made me realise i would never loved anyone before, it felt amazing loving someone so much. i pretty much forgot i had depression and i was not self loathing. i was truly happy for one of the few times in my life. if i was ever sad she would cheer me up and i felt so comfortable talking to her which is not the case now at all when i talk to my friends even ones who re depressed themselves, it is just not the same. now i have gone to the happiest i have ever felt in my life to the absolute worst and it is absolutely floored me. i can deal with depression as have had to all my life but not when it is this severe. my new years resolutions are to try and change my life for the better been the person she wouldn t have broken up with. i always hope we can go back. i know this is an unhealthy hope. but it is the only thing that motivates me. but how the fuck do you learn to love yourself? hope everyone has a great year btw!	moderate

failure after failure after failure september of last year, i moved into this neighborhood. my girlfriend had just broken up with me, so i was not depressed, only sad. i am almost years old now, btw, which makes this story all the more harder to tell. but anyhow, i hung out with this girl in the neighborhood, and soon, i asked her out. late october, she moved out, and i had no idea about it until they were long gone. we d either meet up in the woods, somewhere in the neighborhood, or my house, never her s. she did not even say goodbye, i was destroyed when i heard about it. but this is not all. i actually fell into depression when the next door neighbor kid, my only friend anymore, said that we could not hang out anymore, of which the reasons are beyond me. late december, another girl moved in. i hung out with her for a bit, then she asked me out. this definitely lightened my depression, but not all of it. it was early january when she broke up with me by these exact words, you thisgusting, conspiracist hob goblin! get off of my porch, you vile creature, i do not ever want to see that face ever again! i was so completely devastated that i cried the rest of that day and through the night. i would ignore my parents. i would ignore my few school friends and teachers. this caused my grades to fall, causing constant harassment of my family and teachers, and a huge loss of friends. in late january, she came to my house with a silver ring, a raven. she apologized for her nasty behavior, and we talked for a while. my parents were out of town, so we went back to my house. we chatted, then we, this is kinda hard for me, i ate her out. so, the next day, i went over to her house, unannounced. i saw her kiss some other dude, who left after that. i ran home crying, again. and i have been depressed since then, and i have only had friends during this, one of which rejected me twice, and she hangs out with me half out of pity. so here we are, present day. i will get these headaches at least once a day, and i will think about my two girlfriends who abandoned and betrayed me. and in my current state of mind, i do not blame them. i have lost all of my friends, i do not feel like my family loves me, my teachers do not care, the few people i have loved sold me out. i wonder if anyone would notice if i just died. i just do not know what to do with myself, and i feel like i have burdened every person i have ever met, and i feel like i should lift those burdens, but i do not have the capacity to do it, which makes me feel like a coward. i just do not know what to do.	moderate

what do i do?? throwaway account for obvious privacy reasons i am a almost year old male, living in a middle eastern country that little people know of, named jordan. i am currently one of if not the worst in terms of marks in school. i have a strong pc addiction, mostly playing hours on school days, and up to hours on weekends. i find studying nearly impossible, i just, i can not get motivation to study. worst part is that i have been feeling nothing but sadness, and i have been finding myself repeatedly deciding on which is the best way i could end my life. at this rate, suicide for me, is just, inevitable. i recognize my problem, and i want professional help, i want to go to a psychologist, but i come to the truth that psychologists do not really exist in my country . a quick search of google maps reveals no real psychologists, and to add insult to injury, depression is usually very neglected in my country. if i reveal my depression, the first response is to say you re a spoiled kid . my family is likely to travel to europe in months, and i want to seek help there, but i simply can not get money as a year old in order to pay for therapy. i am not even sure if i am allowed to go to a psychologist alone. i simply can not tell my parents that i am suicidal, i just, i can not, i dont want them to intervene, i want to solve this without them, it would be humiliating for me. i always question my self why am i really here, why can not i just leave? i have already decided on a method of suicide, and it will probably happen within a year at this rate. i have no value in life, nobody likes me, i am not good at anything. i am just a useless observing rock that consumes resources. i love you, mom. i love you, dad, but i just can not take this anymore. this might as well be my last day.	moderate

desolation depression is writing sick poetry on skin and publishing it with scars, cutting on ankles, not wrists because you re scared you ll get in trouble but you so desperately need to be seen, and never are. depression is writing the word alone and seeing the word home , accepting the pain like a gift because you deserve it. depression is admitting suicidal thoughts to paper and not to people, and loving the broken things, hoping to tie them together, thinking maybe things will get better, but knowing that is just wishful thinking.	moderate

i am highly functioning days of the year. i am . i have a great job, i graduated with my degree, i live in a great town, and i am engaged. but i have no friends. my family is all estranged. the only family members i do have all live states away. every time i try to talk to them they are talking about how they do not have any money and it stresses me out because i do not have enough money to give. me and my fianc have run out of things to talk about. but perhaps that is just me who does not have anything to talk about right now. the cloudiness in houston just makes it worse. now i have my new job where i can work from home if i want on some days. that probably is not a good thing. i have high functioning depression and no one believes me when i tell him i am suffering inside. i am suffering days of the year and for days a year i am pretending i am ok. it is tiring. it makes me sleepy. i feel lonely. i have no one to talk to. i have my one cat, who never leaves me alone. he is all i have right now.	moderate
i am supposed to be objectively happy, but i am not and i just need something. to explain a little of my backstory, i will try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. i used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. i was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. i crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self harm. i eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i skimped by. i had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor i had. i graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. my first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. see, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. i was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. i eventually moved away and then got a job. i had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self hatred to a constant need for approval from others. i eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. i started dating a girl i had met online. i decided to go back to school, because i have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significan not other. however, i am not happy. i am not happy right now, regardless of how well i am doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family is health are all standard. i am simply not happy, and i have been thisassociating to the point where sometimes i can see myself from a third point of view and i do not know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. i can honestly say that for the first time in a while, i want to die, for no particular reason. i simply wish to... cease existence. but i know i can not just do that. i know how much it would hurt the people i care about. but i do not know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple. please help me, i beg you.	moderate
i did something i wish i did not trigger warning self harm i bought a bottle of wine on my way home from work lastnight. drinking alone is never good for me but i felt like i really needed to drink. anyway glasses in i am trying to find somebody to hang out with, texting all my friends that are nearby and everyone was busy. i felt so lonely, painfully lonely, and i started hating on myself. i have learned to really love myself the past few years but lastnight my dark side emerged and i wanted to hurt myself. i took a knife to my leg and just started cutting, something i have not done since high school. when i was finished i just looked at it and knew it was a mistake, now i am going to have to hide it till it heals. no sex, no beach pool trips, no shorts the weather is always warm where i live so even though it is winter these things are still an option for me ... i have limited myself by a few moments of weakness but i am trying to forgive myself. i just had to get it off my chest. there was only one person i could talk to about it and while he did a lot for me i feel like i needed to say something about it here as well.	moderate
feels like all my passion is just gone my life has been rather stressful as of late, i ended up dropping high school due to not really caring. the only person who was able to really convince me to try and do anything with my life is my therapist. now, i have had a few different ones through out my life, and this was the first one that felt really comfortable talking about things on a more personal level. however, just recently i found out that they will be transitioning me off to a new therapist. this is mostly because my original one has too many people they have to work on. i will admit that it felt like terrible timing, since we were just looking into possible alternative schools i could do. i met my new therapist as well, and i honestly just do not really like them, or at least feel comfotable. the only problem is they are one of the last ones i can see. i just do not see myself working with them out of being uncomfortable. it kind of feels like everything i have been working up on as kind of been ripped away. mostly because i have a really hard time opening up to new people. i just do not really know what to do anymore, i guess i have just kind of given up.	not depression
i was getting better till i was not so in the last few months my life was improving a bit, i went back to gym, started to study and to like myself again, but everything went downhill when i meet a girl in a coffe shop. i was sitting with some of my friends and one of them pointed out this girl is looking at my general direction, so after hour of my friends encouraging me and pushing me to speak with her she was still looking and glimpsing at me i did, i tried my best but i stuttered and was nervous but she seemed interested and tried her best continue the conversation, then she offered me to sit and we spoke for h tell her friends came. she introduced me to them and i think they liked me. in the end everyone was leaving and i did not have the courage to get her contact information. later on that day and the day after it, i was hating my self because i could have done better. so after that interaction i started hating my self again because i fucked up with only girl who seemed interested me in years . i went in deep depression for a full week not even leaving for the uni. i live alone in a foreign country my family are in a different continent and they do not even believe in depression or any mental illnesses. so reddit is the only place i can express my self. and sorry for the my broken english	moderate
not feeling enough and wanting to lighten my heart by sharing hi reddit, this is going to be one of my first posts so bear with me. i was feeling blue and did not really know what to do except for just lying in my bed, listening to loud music and staring at my laptop screen and feeling empty. so i came across this subreddit and after reading some of the posts here i thought that i might feel better to just write a fucking post to get it all out. i am an anxious person. i love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how i deal with it is to make myself busy with life. school and side activities, part time jobs and partying. but now that i have had extra time i get remembered of demons and all the reasons why i think i am a failure. first, i get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. i have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and i have seven nieces. i am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since i came into the picture rather late. my relationship with my siblings is non existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. i also live in another city than them which does not make it easier to get in touch. i feel like i actually do not know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. i do not know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. and the thing is i really do want to get closer to them, but i get so anxious around them and i can not relax. i feel like a personality less person who does not even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because i have this barrier that would not let me just be calm and be myself. the only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol does not mix well together. but i love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. but the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that would not let me leave the bed and i would not even open my phone for hours because i always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though i know that there is not anything bad there. when i am feeling my worst this anxiety would not let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one will find me. my mailbox, both email and at home get filled because i have the fear of finding something i would not like. i, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since i do not have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. i wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school. but i always tell myself that i am not enough for anyone and that i am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. but i have had guys showing interest in me, but i get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. and then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it is for the best because i like being alone anyways. friends. i have met a lot of people in my life, but i am not very good at keeping them in my life. people try to get into my life but i get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. or when i am with people i actually do like i get scared that i am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. i get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and i am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they would not leave the salon. that is why, if i do not get invited to one smaller thing or do not hear of something they all seem to know i take it so fucking personal even though they did not even mean to not include me. but since i am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and i start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck i am doing on this planet. i suck at calling people or asking people how they are. maybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and i hope that i will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry! because anxiety. lots of love from this anxiety filled blob.	moderate
am i a horrible person for lying to my roommate? i feel like one... i got stitches in the bottom of my right foot because i left a box cutter blade on the floor. i bought them when i was not doing well and i swear i never used them. i used coping skills and did not cut. i am almost a full year clean from it. one must have fallen on the floor because i stepped on it and cut the bottom of my foot wide open. i did not want my roommate to worry about the razor blades so i told her it was a paring knife and that it got thrown away. i also lied about what it was to the nurses because that hospital treated me for my suicide attempt. i got help since and i am doing better. not suicidal. i did not want them to think i would cut myself. i mean, why the hell would i cut the sole of my foot. my right foot?? i can not drive or work or walk without crutches for at least weeks. i kept it a lie because i did not want to worry them. but my roommate found the razor blade that had been stuck in my foot in the trash. she must have dug a bit to find it. i tried to explain why i felt i had to lie, but she wouldn t listen and said that i was now a liar in her eyes and she can not trust me now. i tried to apologize but she just stormed out of my room. so i am just laying in bed pissed off and feeling guilty. i mean, she had to drive me to the hospital to get the stitches. part of me is cringing because i should have told her the truth. but the other part of me is angry that she wouldn t even hear me out on why i tried to keep the truth from her. i just wish i could rewind time and stop all this drama from happening. i just.. need some advice here.	not depression

anybody else notices you get treated differently by others once they find out you have depression anxiety etc? or that you grew up in a fucked up environment? i have lost count how many times i have experienced this. a potential friend or my boyfriends friends find out i lost my mom in middle school, that i was abused, that i was in foster care, and immediately you hear the soft oh... or i am sorry about that... and watch them take a step back from you emotionally because they think you re unstable or need to be coddled. then they start to ghost you because you re the damaged and weird kid and they would rather not deal that. this has happened so many times that unless i really have to i do not tell them about my past, yet since this is a small town everybody finds out easily, especially the younger people around my age. i am so sick of this shit and it really deters needs from wanting to make friends because i am always treated like i have some contagious thisease. fuck be yourself shit, i have tried that for years and all i get is getting name called, ghosted after a few hang outs, whatnot. i do not even allude to the fact i am messed up, because i hide it well when i am around others. does anybody else experience this?	moderate
new year, new negative patterns. i had a panic attack out of nowhere while thinking about how shitty last year was. i was very aggravated like so many people on midnight who have not had a good year. now i can not stop thinking about whens the next panic attack. i also noticed i keep giving away things for free to people or money to streamers over and over again thinking in some way i can buy friendship or just be to nice. these people owe me nothing and while some technically live close i guess i am developing a unhealthy obsession of one day being able to meet these people or just be accepted. i have been in hermit mode for about weeks now. i refuse to bother to do things other than trying not to thisappoint others. just need to vent.	not depression
i can not even articulate how fucking angry i am at everything right now. i do not even want to elaborate too much. i am angry because i am angry in the first place. this constant need for validation and love from people that do not matter needs to stop. but it will never stop. it is a never ending cycle of feeling lonely, seeking friendship, realizing you can not make people like you, and severing ties with a community that did not care and probably did not even know you. rinse and fucking repeat. it is all so fucking pointless. the worst part is, i do not even know what to do with myself after leaving. i do not matter to these people yet i am obsessed with them. what is wrong with me? i need to know where everything went wrong. this mixture of low self esteem and idolization of others is lethal to me. i can not deal with this shit. i need a thistraction. i need to focus on the people that are actually in my life. i need to spend less time online. i need to fucking die sometimes.	moderate

coming to an end no one really really understand until i am gone! does my life actually mean something. what was i even put on this earth for? to suffer???? because that is what i have been doing. since i was i have felt like shit. and i feel even worse. i could never fit in with anyone and still can not. all i do now is sit in my room no job, can not drive, no friends just waiting for this all to be over. certain death does not really frighten me anymore. i am getting more and more comfortable. it helps knowing that there is a way out of all this shit. just do not know when is the right time. i know one day i will really crack and i will be prepared for it. i am surrounded by fake people who do not care. and i am tired of it. i do not even cry anymore when i write these. i am used to it and feel calm. i just want to make sure when i do decide to end this. i want certain people to know how much they meant to me and the rest to know how much i hated them deep deep down.	moderate

i hate the realization of knowing that you are really alone i know many people feel lonely, left behind or forgotten and from time to time i think so too. i will feel very lonely then, think about all the years i was left completely alone to deal with all my inner demons and how i was the one who had told me to hold on for the people i love. but sometimes, like right now, the real realization of how alone i really am, hits me and it is so painful. i have a hard time crying but those are the moments where i feel the tears. i do not know how to describe it. this feeling of realizing that you are completely left alone and always have been. that no one knows how you have been feeling for all this years and it breaks my heart so much. i do not know what i want or expect from other people because everytime someone gets close to me, i push them away. i am just tired of feeling so much pain and sadness. will this ever end? like really, will this ever have an end? i do not want sadness to be my way of living anymore. it is so tiring and my heart is just breaking over and over and over. i do not know if anyone really understands how desperate i am right now, to find anything to hold onto. i do not know what to do anymore.	not depression

my heart aches but i can not break recently my relationship ended, not only did i lose my boyfriend i lost my best friend. i amso attached to him, we lived together for at least months. ive been struggling with depression since. i tend to really be influenced by those i date if the relationship lasts over months. ive also had a drinking problem that i just now got a grip on before the breakup . what are proper coping mechanisms? what do nonalcoholics even do? i know i can not binge drink, amp i know i can not let myself sink into deep depression bc that will result in a breakdown which leads to binge drinking. the nights have become the loneliest bc during the day i must act like everything is ok. i dont want people to worry abt me so i just stay in. i dont have any energy to go outside amp be around multiple people. i wake up wanting to roll back amp go to sleep bt when it gets to pm i know i can not amp then getting told i have to actually do things is the most off putting thing to hear first thing in the morning like give me time to breathe. i looked into coping mechanisms bc i dont want to burry the event amp not go thru this properly. ive been drinking water amp trying to eat a little bc i know that is what i must do regardless if i want to or even care to. see self care is the hardest part bc i could care less. but today i woke up feeling ok. amp that is a big accomplishment for me. little steps to recovery. ive been watching subbed anime to have something to focus on. i know in time it will get better, i just have to hold on	moderate

it is not your time i know life is hard. it is unfair, unforgiving, and uncaring. there are times where the weight of the world is too much to bare. where waking up is half the battle and getting out of bed is the other. it feels like regardless of how many people are around you telling you they love you, you have never felt so alone. maybe you think suicide is the way out. i can tell you with honesty that i feel the exact same way. every day is a fight to answer the question of if my existence means anything to anyone. i ask myself who would care if i died? i fight these demons every day. hell, it took a week to be able to say any of this here. but, here i stand, fighting this monster with all of you and there is something important you need to know... it is not your time. i have been crying for days in a row thinking about you. yes, you. the person looking at this and thinking of taking his her their own life. and how your life and pain mirrors mine. the facade you put on just to make it through the day. the hellscape that is your brain telling you you re incapable of being loved. that you have no worth or value to anyone in your life. but i want to let you know, you matter to me. your struggle, your sadness, i see you and you mean something. not just to me, and stay with me on this one, but to everyone your light or darkness has touched. the world needs you to live. you do serve a greater purpose. not cause god says so. but because somewhere within you, your light is still going. it may be dimmed, it may be clouded, the fog may be thick. but it is there. you can not die yet. i need you. knowing you exist let us me know i am not alone. and, as mortifying as it is, we share pain. and the idea of losing you would hurt me more than i already do. for me, for us, do not let go. it is not your time.	moderate

not sad or happy about my life but just nothing i am , bilingual, gay not ugly and above average looking and fit , asian, nerdy lived through most of my life being making fun or hated for my eccentricity i have no friends, but many acquaintances. maybe i am putting friends to a very high standard i never had any relationship even though i came out years ago to my parents, and being very open about my sexuality. i do not want to share my body to strangers, so i reject all hook up attempts, and i feel that most gay people i met are just insecure, aimless and superficial i am not shy, and i am eloquent and talkative in front of people. i can easily manage social scenes, but i do not actually care how others think about me. i was diagnosed with depression since high school for years. i quit the medication few years ago because they are influencing my intelligence seriously, i am going to work in software development, and i would rather feel shit but have a functioning brain than living in an illusion of relief and happiness caused by drug i born from a very conservative family in one of the east asian countries. i hate my country and escape to us to study and hope to settle here. i have been here years. now i am getting a master degree in us, and i will be interning at one of the prestigious software company in this summer. now, i realize that my hatred to my mother nation is pointless, my suffering is purely due to my unfitness to this world, and nothing to do with policy and culture i struggled through the hardest part of my depression by following these tips below. .keep a routine and stick to it, no matter how tire how shit you feel. a to do list such as i will wash clothes today at xxxx will help .abandon social network, they are toxic to your mental state. i only use it to share information rather than show off my fake good life or see anyone is fake good life. . leave toxic people, and yes, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. and give up on people, give up on hoping someone will magically show up and fix all your problems. . a healthy life style is very important to keep you energy level up. eat good, sleep good, be active. . search on some higher purpose of life. i give up finding any happiness from human connection. i never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, thisappoint by people again again and again. then i stick my interests to machine, i study computer science and i am fascinated by technology. i develop a religious zealous of what a future world i want to create or envisioned i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. a world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. a world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding. that is why my major focus of my computer science degree is artificial intelligence, go figure. the current state of humanity is pathetic, and that is why there are so many depression on this earth. . then, accept that it is ok to never feel happy again. but the key to manage a life is not being always happy. i feel that i am more and more in the middle ground not happy not sad, but just nothing. in these years since i was diagnosed with depression, i find out a single truth. depression can never be gone and it can only be managed. i gradually accept the fact that i am just a machine, human body is in fact, just a machine and i would not feel the same happiness when i experience the same events like normal people do. i will feel nothing, but sometime i feel that these kinds of nothingness is a form of tranquility. as long as i am not in constant pain and agony, i am fine with my current state. when people hurt me, i do not care. when people benefits me, i do not care. people are too predictable for me, and they are not important anymore. the only exception is my parents because i feel sorry for them to suffer me however, after i live with these mindset for years, i gradually observe that not all people are asshole in nature. not all people are ignorant. i will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation. someone who are supposed to hurt me, do not act upon, or someone who are supposed to benefits me, do not act upon maybe as a person with depression, i can never experiences the joy of living with in this world. but it does not stop you to live out of this world, just treat it as a long boring trip on a train with randomly popping in objects of interests. it is not hard at all to get used to this.	severe

reality check. for a large portion of us, we will struggle with this for the rest of our lives. because no matter how many cocktails they offer, therapists we see, or promises they make, it would not change the fact that we are alone. not by choice but because of the way our world functions. how many times have you heard i need my space. i wore myself out worrying over you. you just do not want to get better. did you forget to take your medication? yet we are told that you have to love yourself. how can you love anyone else if you do not love yourself? it gets better. you just have to believe. you re not the only one suffering, others have it worse. it is comedic at this point. amp nbsp who can blame them really? spending your life with someone who has depression is probably not high up on anyone is list. if you find someone who will stay by your side, you have someone most of us will never have. someone rarer than gold, an exception, not the rule. cherish them. amp nbsp the truth is most of us are tired and there is no where to go. no one to turn to who would not put you into a cage while asking you to be happy about it. there is nothing for us. some of you will find hobbies that keep your mind off of these facets of our shared situations. some find solace in helping others as they are rotting away inside. others just retract into an ever expanding black hole. amp nbsp regardless of our coping mechanisms or the labels they give them, the effects of this thisease remain. it itself remains. it takes you apart piece by piece. it wears down the people around you until they can not take it anymore. it leaves us alone, broken apart, fruitlessly trying to piece some semblance of an existence together. is it any wonder why some people choose to check out? a real conversation needs to be had, because people is attitudes towards this thisease are not changing for the better. the way they treat people with this thisease is not changing for the better. it is all an assembly line to produce something they find palatable. something they do not need to develop any self awareness or perspective for. no one actually cares about the words on this screen, the person behind them, or the tears that fall onto the keyboard as they are typed. this entire website essentially functions as a social pressure relief valve. clearly it is not working if the suicide statistics are any indication. i am tired of pretending all of this is anything but a cruel joke. the reality is what it is and i am done surviving in it.	moderate
i feel like depression is the lack of a goal. its like depressed people are more near to the buddhistic truth of the endless chain of suffering. we all got raised into a society that needs us only to perform well. and if we dont perform a certain way we end up being depressed. 	not depression
starting my first ever ssri celexa today. also on buspar. could use some insight! cross posted in r anxiety starting my first ever ssri celexa this weekend. also on buspar. could use some input. after being on buspar for a few months, it is helped my anxiety to the point where i do not really have panic attacks anymore, and my general daily anxiety has subsided a bit. but i am definitely not . even though the anxiety is subsiding, i still do not feel normal. in fact, i have felt blank for years due to anxiety and depression, my baseline is quite low. i do not really know what it is like to feel normal or . i am just used to dealing with it day to day. i told my doc all of this the other day while checking how the buspar was working. when i look to my future, i do not really see one. not because i am suicidal or anything thankfully i do not have those thoughts, but because it just feels like i am living day by day without much projection in my life. i go to work, go home, and my social life is really bland for a yr old guy. the doc said that depression is definitely comorbid with my anxiety you do not say! and prescribed be celexa. i have never been on an ssri, the only med i have ever been on regularly has been buspar. i am a little nervous to start it, for some reason. i am supposed to take my first dose this morning. doc said the only side effect i will probably run into is drowsiness. she specifically chose celexa because apparently it has less severe side effects when compared to zoloft for a guy my age. anyone have some input for my situation? it would be greatly appreciated!	severe
i just remembered a life defining moment it was first grade. award ceremony for numerous things. i do not remember what the award was for, but it did not matter. one by one my classmates were called up. they all started gathering on the stage. i sat there on the floor, crisscross applesauce, thinking almost time to get up my name was never called. i sat there in a empty space of the floor, crying in shame. it felt like all eyes were on me. my mother was probably thisappointed since then. that day, it should have sunk in that i was never going to amount to anything. just like before, all i can do is sit here and cry. the only difference is now i am begging to die.	not depression

the circumstances might change, but i would not i just realized that it would not really matter what i do or accomplish if my mentality stays the same. i thought for a while that all i needed was a goal but goal passion. i do not think that i will ever be satisfied with what i am doing, i do not think i will ever feel like i am doing something that is worth it to somebody. i have not really longed for anything for so long now. the only thing i want is to be alone but when i am alone i get mad at myself for not doing something with my time. it is not going to go anywhere. i do not want people in my life so i can thisappear when i want to because i do not see myself actually going through the stages of adulthood. most of all i do not really know what to do with myself or if i really need to exist.	moderate

this world has no place for people like me. a bit of context. i am an american. i am black. i am big. i am ugly. and i am autistic. i work as an aircraft mechanic. the more i go through every day, the less i see the point of continuing with this life. no one who is gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. people make fun of my quirks all the time they think they are being funny, but they are being obnoxious. besides that, the only friends i still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. my father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while i was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him. besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. i clearly have problems that i do not know how to address. no amount of therapy has fixed those issues. people cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. society here in general does not like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. i know that i would not ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because i am likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. i have been racially profiled many times when i lived in new york city. i happened to be stopped for every random drug search whenever i took the staten island ferry while carrying a backpack. that being the case, the only value of any sort i can provide to society is in the job i do. i am also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day i am questioning more and more why i care. more money is not going to fix me as a person. the truth is, i am a mistake. i learned a few years ago that i was adopted at birth. probably before my new parents knew i would be as difficult as i was. i should have been aborted or left to die. the prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who do not give a shit about us. there is no reason to believe things will get better people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards. before long, i will have a gun. it will allow me to protect myself where i know law enforcement would not. but it will also give me the power to choose when i want to die. that, at the very least, will give me peace of mind knowing i have a way out whenever i need it. i am not some starving kid in africa or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are thiscontented, but i have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. i see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse.	moderate

do i have depression? i know that i can not be diagnosed on here, but i want an opinion on whether or not i may have it. here is what i am experiencing i am , for context no inner thoughts, just made up scenarios and music in my head bad hygiene. i make sure that i do not smell bad while at school and keep my hair clean, but that is about it i bite my nails and the skin around them, this has been going on for as long as i can remember i eat out of boredom and have gained lbs as a result. i do not like my body and it holds me back from living my life and doing things, but i never follow through and lose weight. no care for anything anymore. i used to be the most empathetic and caring person, but i feel desensitized to most things and never worry or care about anything can not laugh easily anymore. i used to laugh all the time, at everything. i guess that as you get older that happens, but i literally do not find anything funny that other people do and i can not remember the last time i laughed really hard i never feel truly happy. if i get something i have been looking forward to a new phone, for example i will be super happy, but that is it. nothing makes me really think or care. like the coronavirus for example, i just am like oh, ok i always sit around on my phone and do nothing when i could be doing so many other things, but i have no motivation to do them. i am sort of irritable towards my mom at times. i guess that i could be bitter from the names she calls me asshole, bitch, cunt, fatass, lazy, failure . my mom and i get into bad arguments as as a result, but not often. during those moments when they get really bad, i feel like i do not want to be here.	moderate

get home and go right to bed i have no motivation or will to live. recently i have been coming home from work and taking benedryl or trazodone and getting right into bed by pm. i relapsed with cutting this morning when i could not fall back asleep. it is almost been months since i found my dad dead on his couch and it seems like i have been spiraling ever since. i have gotten into accidents from drunk driving and i can not stop drinking or chasing men who use me for sex. i have not worked out since he died and exist off of taco bell. i can not afford therapy and i do not have health insurance. i do not know what to do.	severe
i can hide everything except my scent i go to work feeling gross. my armpits are always smelly. i have tried to shower daily, wear deodorant and cologne but i just... do not do anything about it. it weights me so much yet i can not get a hold of myself. i am thisgusting, i can go weeks without showering or brushing my teeth. it is very obvious that my friends, family and coworkers realise that i stink and they are becoming increasingly passive aggressive about it. it all makes me so sad...	not depression
i am so empty i wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. i ponder if i want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. i look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. i begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. to once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. maybe even death. my reminiscing is cut short by a year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. felicity. my baby sister is one of the few reasons i get up in the morning. and to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what i guess was joy. it is now time for me to put on the mask. i have learned many things about depression in the past years. one of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. the trauma, and pain i have experienced from the hospitals i have been subjected to, are second to none. absolute agony. so i wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy. i walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding felicity is hand, and i am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. today i must play with felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. i also can not talk to either of my parents about how i am doing, because i would be bothering them. i do not do most of these things. i simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. i do this everyday. i fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. i do this everyday. i eat. and eat, and eat, and eat, until i feel like throwing up. i do nothing with my life. the only thing i do is listen to music. i love music. i truly adore all kinds of it. i love learning about music. i love listening to music. i play instruments, and produce music. but i do not anymore depression has taken away my future. i do not have the drive to create music. so i just sit. i sit. i eat, i sleep, and i do it all again. i am so alone, i am so sad. i am so empty. not quite sure what this post is, but i feel like shit, and do not want to live like this anymore. any advice is appreciated	severe
i woke up at pm today. nobody has bothered to contact me. or ask if i am okay. i go to a bar that opens at usually from the time it opens to when it closes. nobody is asking where i am. i bet they are glad i am not there. i just slept hours and i am still fucking tired. i am not going to accomplish anything today why am i even bothering	moderate

life just fell apart and i need advice to help me grow in the right direction. i have dealt with depression for the past two years and i have been in a toxic on and off relationship friendship with a girl that i have a lot of feelings for. the arguments are sometimes my fault and sometimes her fault but they usually end with her blocking me and me being miserable until she reaches back out to me a day later. my depression has gotten so bad that i just stopped going to my college classes and did nothing but stay in my room. days ago i was on the phone with the girl and we had a huge argument and that argument mixed with my fear of what my parents would say when they found out i was failing school drove me to the point of saying some suicidal stuff. the girl ended up calling the police and then blocking me on everything. i went to a rehab facility for a bit and i am on some new medication. my parents were very loving and welcomed me back at my home i am . i know that i need to cut her out and i mostly have but i am still leaving strings attached and she is on my mind all the time. what can i do to cope with the sadness that comes from me and her trying to end what we have for good?	moderate

plans hi guys, my names cayden mac. i live at e nd st, oakland, cali. lately i have been so upset and depressed, from my father recently passing and being unaccepted for my gender and sexual preferences in public, like my workplace and daily places. i have planned to lash out against the community by going to st. anthonys catholic middle school, just down the street from my house, and open firing on the class students, and when the massacre is over, i plan to kill myself. the reasoning for what i am going to do is back to my gender, and not being accepted thru the bible, i think this is a justified response.	moderate

life is just very bland, to an uncomfortable, empty degree so, for some back context i am , male, i live with my girlfriend, , and i left home to move across the country for work new zealand, moved from wellington to tauranga, basically km away from where i grew up, all my family and friends . things have been up and down, but despite days where things are good, things also feel highly negative anyway. for example, today i spent hours cleaning my car by hand, polishing, waxing, etc and it felt good to clean it up. as most of you may know, when you get into a slump your environments tend to fall down into a mess with you. so it felt good to tidy it up finally. despite that, i do not feel accomplished, i do not feel happy, partly stems from finding out my girlfriend had been lying to me for months about her smoking habit, and despite switching to a vape to restart quitting for real this time i still feel extremely stuck on that. not hate, just another thing contributing to this overall bland feeling that things are just happening around me in life and i am not really involved in it. i have good hours at work, my boss is amazingly understanding, i have a family wedding approaching in weeks. yet all of it i feel increasingly detached from. it is hard to describe, i do not feel like crying, i do not feel like suicide, i do not feel like self harm, i just feel empty, unattached to anything going on, it does not matter if i act in situations because bad things occur anyway like i do not exist in my friendships and relationship, so i feel like if i just stop existing nothing would alter, nobody would be affected, like i was never there in the first place. i have good days, nothing goes wrong at all, but still i do not feel happy i do not feel good it is just a day where nothing overly bad happened so it is classified as good. i have lost all motivation to show up to my job, i do the bare minimum to pay my rent and bills then i call sick and i am ashamed of it, i hate being at home but if i show up to work all that happens is i get a panic attack, crawl into the bathroom and have a breakdown for half an hour and everyone questions it. i can not even bother to take myself out anywhere, unless it is important i shut any idea i have down and just sit in bed. all of it just gets hit with what is the point ill just be using my time being sad and moody elsewhere so why bother going out just needed a rant really, all my friends i had here in town were workmates who have now quit for university and moved away, the new hires do not speak english and are older, my girlfriend is here but she has her own issues and unloading all my unhappiness on her will just make more issues than it will help because nobody can fix me, except myself and my own motivation to get out of this rut. i just wish i had a circle to come drag me out of the house, or people on thiscord to game with, literally any form of contact to fill my time in with and rethiscover love for doing things. hopefully things pick up soon	moderate

venting.... i do not know where else to go.... i do not know where else to vent. i am scared of judgment. i feel like i am just lonely and attention seeking. i feel like a waste of space. i do not understand why my boyfriend could love me when i do not even love myself. i keep a lot of mental health stuff away from him because i am scared of how he will react. the first time i self harmed i showed my ex and he got angry at me. i wish i never dated that asshole. i wish i never existed. i better off dead but too scared to die. i wish i could manage to starve but i can not even do that right. pounds. fat ass. i am a fat ass failure who could never get a job. can not even stick to trying to learn french. i want to die but like i said i am too scared to. i can not just depend on my boyfriend to keep me happy that is selfish. he has his own problems. i try my best to listen when he wants to let some feelings out. sometimes i feel like he just feels sorry for me.... sometimes i wonder if my friends really care..... if my family even cares. i think my friends sometimes just think how annoying i am. i swear i am better off dead. i am a burden.... nothing but a waste. why am i here? why? i am horrible at writing. why do i try? i can not draw for shit so i basically scribble and call it art i have tried so hard to become better at drawing.... i just can not do it. i try to have good and interesting stories.... they are shitty and predictable. my ocs are all really bad mary sues. why did you read this? i just wasted your time.... i would think you have better things to do. go ahead bully me.... i do not care.... rip into me. call me all the names you want. call me pathetic. i deserve it.	moderate
crying to the point of wanting to claw my face off just as the title says, my chest is hurting too much and i have so much weight on my heart. my husband does not seem to appreciate what i do. he works during the week while i take care of our baby, and he says to me he would rather stay home watching baby than go to work. now to me, that seems to imply that caring for a baby is easier than his job. well it is not, and it is pretty much driving me into the deep end and i want to hurt myself. i have cried with such anger that i dug my fingernails into my flesh causing pain and at the same time relief that i could feel it. and i know you re probably going to say oh that is ppd doctors can give you meds go see a therapist yadda yadda.. i am tired of hearing it. i am only writing this because i have no where else to vent and get off my chest. i am beginning to wonder if the ones who experience depression are meant to so they would eventually take their lives to trim the human population since we really do not have a natural predator to maintain population.. but then again, we are our own predator since we kill off each other through wars, difference of opinion, and just plain stupidity. that is another thing that upsets me. there are way too many people inventing shit that they feel is justified and then push it on others when they do not agree. we do not even abide the laws of nature, instead we corrupt it and even laugh at it. when i was younger, everything was awesome and never had to deal with the social problems that are going on now. i mean, where the fuck did that even come from!? it makes me sick and hate living surrounded by that shit, i do not even watch tv because it thisgusts me too much. i do not want to live any longer having to deal with it .. it is too much wasted energy. ah fuck it.	not depression

my girlfriend is thinking about cutting and i am not sure how to go about this topic hey guys, so i will just give a little background theres not much that needs to be said really . i am a m and she is a f and we are about months into our official relationship after talking for about months beforehand. she has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better body part like legs or waist . she has told me about how she is had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. she has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself which almost everyone does though idk i just thought i should ad even though that is a different topic entirely . she also tends to have severe anxiety or something attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. in an effort to be there for her i have tried to do the following things these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike make it known that i am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she is feeling down. actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it. make sure that when we talk about it i focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess . also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she did not have these thoughts so no random how are you feeling etc... and i have told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever! now i would be lying if i said i have not messed up with doing keeping those things in mind . i have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. i have kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it is just a really sensitive topic as we all know. i was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. any pointers on what i could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? is there somethingi amnot doing that i should be doing? is there somethingi amdoing that i should not be doing? i love her a lot and i really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody is job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this. thanks to anyone who responds! you are all loved 	not depression

i wrote this to get things off my chest. now i have to find the strength to actually tell them... i am home home alone, wishing you were by my side. but you re out with him, wishing it was me, so i am left confused with my head in hands. i do not know what is going on, but this path i am following can not go on. it is pain, it is pleasure. it is guilt, it is bliss. are you someone i have, or someone i should miss? you say you miss me, and want to be by me, yet i am left alone, and depression consumes me. for a moment i feel like i have you, only for you to say i am sorry, i just can not yet i know you do not know when, i know you re also confused. i can not hate you, i can not blame you. i gave you away, and that is on me. i can not find a clue in what we are becoming, and can not grasp the fact i might have to live without you. i know i am being greedy, and its hurting us both, but i am not ready to give up our possibility. i will take this pain, for a little while longer, but idk how much i can keep on without going bonkers. i drive myself to insane with these thoughts and hope s. i feel like i am waiting my turn in a game of jump rope.	not depression
i hate life right now hi, i am going through a really rough period and it feels as though everything is getting on top of me. i am a second year student studying computer science with games programming and i am really struggling. right now i have deadlines due in one in ten days. luckily i have almost completed the programming for the one in ten days, but i still have to write the report and fix little bits. the rest of them are causing me so much anxiety and stress, and i do not feel like i am going to pass them at all. i do not feel like i have learned much at all in my time here, i hate lectures with a passion because just sitting there listening to someone drone on about something when they would rather not be there does not help me at all, and honestly, i am just completely burnt out and exhausted. everything feels like the biggest job in the world even just sleeping and waking up feels difficult and heavy, nevermind having to code an ai and understand quantum computing. i have tried to do my own research, get stuff done on time and look after myself during all this but i just can not do it anymore. i am struggling to remember anything, i barely even remember yesterday. every day feels the exact same. then it comes to placements. i have applied for some placements and thus far have not been accepted for any of them. i have just applied for the final one that i am actually interested in and am really, really hoping that i get it because i know that i will be really thisadvantaged if i do not get one. additionally, the placement sounds awesome and i literally can not do another year of education straight after this one, i would end up just dropping out. i think what is really frustrating to me is that all of the placements have expected us to know several things in a great detail of depth which imo, we have not been taught. i have tried to look at this stuff online and in books, and just can not concentrate on it. i am too burnt out to read and remember the stuff, plus i find learning from books to be just as bad as lectures. the modules which are meant to be teaching us this stuff have either been on strike or have not covered topics in depth enough to meet the placement is needs. we have also had lessons canceled due to strikes for months and now the uni is doing all lessons online due to coronavirus i do not feel like we have been taught much at all and i know that i am going to struggle with online teaching more than i do in person. for two of my modules, we have just been told to copy and paste stuff and that is it. my head is just constantly thinking about uni and work over and over and i can not seem to get it to stop. i just really needed to rant. if anyone has any advice for me or anything then that would be greatly appreciated. thanks	moderate
the happiness mask howdy everyone! i wanted to touch on an interesting subject for me. first of all i am an th grader and i have been suffering from severe depression and ocd anxiety since the th grade...and yes i go to a psychiatrist i have not diagnosed myself on my own. i take kinds of meds with relatively high doses, but i do not want to thiscuss that i want to talk about something else! my life is not the brightest in the first place, but it got worse a month ago. my father passed away at the age of ...and he was a cancer patient. from all the horrible experiences in my life so far i still believe i have not seen anything yet. let alone the dark and suicidal thoughts that i have from my depression. so my question is...i am turning into such a happy and optimistic person and all this suffering has turned me into a much more mature person. i like to think i am more mature than most teens at my age. someone told me that people like to give what they do not have. like if i do not have a happy life, it would make me much happier if i made someone happy. and it was not till recently that i found out that it is true! so it is not like i am pretending to be happy in front of people. it is not a happiness mask it is just that i love being positive to people because that makes me positive as well! so do not think of your depression as a handicap think of it as a way to get more mature and experience life. plus a successful person with depression is way stronger than a successful one without something dragging them down! so stay strong and keep fighting guys i know how it is to feel lost, lonely, not knowing who you are, not knowing if you re worth it, not knowing if anyone loves you. but in the end you should matter to yourself. i know you might hate yourself but you have to love yourself and care for yourself. your mental health is important and do not feel hesitant to ask for help, especially professional help! these are just some thoughts that have been roaming my mind lately! please tell me your opinion on this subject and i hope i brightened up your day and you re definitely not alone in this world. take it from a depression patient. anyways i hope you have a wonderful day! ps i forgot to mention that you re never going to be always happy but you should keep fighting for happiness	severe
forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. realizing this might just help me before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. but when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. as if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and thiscard the old busy life. as for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations i have had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. i could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. you got some of them dark jokes somthing you probably can help me with etc . i guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place. so when i am depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago despite the self hatred and despair. in that way, it might just help me. i sound like a therapist talking to a depressed yo, i know. but i sorta hope this is uplifting. but i want to add the fact that i am , and i have had depression times in my life. and maybe i have yet to thiscover what real depression is, or have not lived long enough to actually state this as matter of fact	severe
