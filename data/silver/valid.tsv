a story i remember the ti ame i would get on my ds to play nintendogs. i would be at my grandparents house, having fun with my chihuahua. it was nice and calming, having no trouble when i need to get in a safe space. peaceful music was played whenever i would walk my dog. competitive, yet smooth music played whenever i would enter competitions. a fun experience was the least i could say. it was amazing. i had a dog once. well, not exactly my dog, it was my grandparents. we called hi am bugsy bugzy? and he was the best goddamn dog i knew. one day, my sisters and i were driving on a highway, when all of a sudden we heard a thud. we suddenly lost control of the vehicle, and we were forced to stop. when we collectively shit ourselves from what the hell just happened, my sister opened her door and went out to inspect what we hit. it was bugsy. a few weeks before, he ran away. i was not sure why he did, he was living a perfectly comfortable life. perhaps he was seeking adventure? nonetheless, we ki willed hi am. we ran hi am over because we did not see hi am coming. we weren t expecting this to happen. we cried. we did not know what to do with the body. she quietly put the carcass on the side of the road, as to not be ran over by others. a while later, i got a ds and my first game nintendogs. and unfortunately, it reminded me of bugsy. i wish i could have done more for that dog. i truly miss hi am. i would take care of hi am as much as i have taken care of that dog in the ds. i feel like an asshole when i say that, because it is ulti amately true. i never played with bugsy that often, but i sti will feel like i am missing out when i think of hi am.	moderate
the world only cares about beautiful people i am born ugly. i have always been ugly all my life and i do not think that i could ever become more beautiful. however, i used to think that if i tried my best and be a good person, people wi will like me too. but i wi will never be treated like those who are beautiful. no matter how much i tried to become a excellent student, a helpful friend, others never really like me, no one cares about my existence. i have no real friends and i have never been in a relationship. in contrast, those beautiful people never have to try. they instantly become the center of attention, have a lot of friends and be successful in life. it is hard to accept that all my efforts would go in vain just because of my ugliness, something that is not even my fault. people usually say not only is he she good looking but he she is also nice . nah, you re wrong. they are nice because they are beautiful, they are nice because others treat them well and they do not have to suffer all the difficulties as us ugly do everyday.	moderate
i try to be social. guess what fucking happens. no one wants to talk to me. this is such fucking bullshit. i make myself available, nobody wants to fucking talk with me or hang out with me. before any one of you comes at me with the you ll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar , i have fucking tried that shit. i have tried it for three goddamn decades and here is what it is gotten me the complete and total lack of ability to create serotonin a shitty, abusive wife who said she would file the divorce papers in october if i had no intention of reconciliation. fuck you, dude, that is all i fucking did was work to make you happy and sacrifice my own goddamned mental wellbeing because i wanted to make you feel like you were worth something. the least you could fucking do would be to file the goddamned paperwork. should not be too fucking hard for you to do, since you decided to not even come down to visit me after our wedding. so yeah. last day i fucking saw your ungrateful face was . the inability to feel anything other than complete and utter hatred of the ti ame the only thing that is kept me happy is the meager social media interaction i have but even now that is starting to dwindle because people keep moving on. people spend all of five minutes with me and oh, i am too busy etc. fuck that you can take ten minutes out of your day and have a conversation with me instead of ignoring me. i wish i had been born prettier. maybe then people would love me.	moderate
i do not deserve love or affection. i honestly am starting to believe i am going to die alone. i have never been good at establishing meaningful relationships with anyone, including my family. i have always felt like an outsider in every situation i have been in. i can not even make friends that ever become much more than acquaintances i see from ti ame to ti ame. not once have i had what i could consider a best friend and dating has never been much better. i have only dated three women, whom i was with long enough for us to meet each other is family. the longest of which was almost ten years and it ended in divorce. i have never been one to feel comfortable in my own skin and going out in public fi wills me with anxiety. i never participated in any sort of hook up culture and it is been a little over two years since i had any sort of inti amate contact with another person. i am miserably lonely and feel like there is just not a single person out there for me. i have seen si amilar posts from people talking about the lack of inti amacy in their own lives and how it takes a toll. i feel dead inside and really do not believe i am in any way adequate enough to make another person happy. with all the other stress in my life due to a complete lack of direction, little to no motivation, and an overall sense of existential dread, i doubt i am even in any condition to maintain a romantic relationship. i am miserable and that wi will only destroy anything i attempt to build. i can not even remember what it is like to truly have feelings for someone, to be excited about the prospect of spending ti ame with them, the joy of having someone in my life. i do not feel like it wi will ever happen again and if it does, i wi will probably just ruin it. at this point, things like getting married again, having kids, starting a family, buying a house, etc. none of those things appeal to me. i have absolutely no interest in them. i see no future for myself where i actually have a sense of self worth or even the faintest sense of identity. i just work and that is it. i try to get involved with a few things or groups, but nothing really makes me happy. i have not got anything to look forward to when i wake up in the morning. even getting a cat leaves me feeling empty. i see the weekend approaching and i know i wi will end up spending my evenings home alone with no one to talk to. it has always been like this, before and after my failed marriage. in spite of the things my ex wife did wrong, i feel more and more that i was the one to blame and that i si amply do not deserve anything good in my life. i can not find it when i go looking for it and it does not seem to fall into place on its own. it is now less a question of if and more a matter of when. i am so tired of all this constant sameness. i just want it over.	moderate
what am i? i am super depressed i guess, i do not want to go out, i do not want to talk to anyone, everything stresses me, i have done things i regret ever knowing or doing. like i do not want this knowledge. i dont want to know anything. i want a easy life, and i dont have one, someti ames i feel like i am in autopilot, when i feel lifeless, like when i dont feel anything, when i feel numb and so over with life, i dont want this life, is so complicated, so full o assholes and dark shit i dont want to be part of, i feel so tired. i guess one of the ways i cope is being isolated, but is not, it just makes this dark entity, it feeds through my isolation, my loneliness, my weaknesses, my stress, and when its full it explodes and it overpowers me. i am weak i feel useless, i dont have any aspiration, all my aspirations and goals are fake, they are not real that is not me. i dont have a me, i dont feel like i exist, i feel like this is not me, i dont know who is me i just know that when i am not doing something everyone expects from me i am not me, i just dont know who am i. the only thing i guess i am sure of is that i have hope, just hope and want to live life, experience things, i want to know the secrets of the world, i want to know the unknown. i know i dont belong nowhere, like i have parents and siblings and a friend nut i dont feel a connection like i dont feel love, am i going crazy? i feel things but i dont know what they are i dont know someti ames. like i care for them if they were ever in any kind of danger or pain and would give my life for my loved ones but in a regular day i feel like doing nothing like i fell nothing, i am always thistracting myself and doing stuff i am good at i guess. i know i am driving my loved ones away from myself but i know is best, they are better knowing i am just an emo heartless bitch who does not care about anything, that is a selfish and has no future they are better of knowing all those things than my true self which is nothing i am just no one with a job to carry on the life of this physical body. i dont know whats happening, i used to be different i used to be the opposite of what i am now, well i guess i was sti will a bitch but with more positive qualities than the bad ones i am portraying right now. ps i am not going to ki will myself, and i am here bc i dont have the resource to seek professional help.	moderate
help i do not know what to do. i can not survive the rest of this school year. i hate going and it is ruining my life. it is causing me major depression. i want to ki will myself. i do not really want to die i just want school to end. please. i do not know what to do. i am too afraid too tell anyone about it. i would not survive more years of school. why does the school system and anyone involved in it hate kids so much. i do not know how much more of this fucking hell i can mentally handle before i decide to ki will myself. i do not want to ruin anyone is life and i do not want to die. i just can not stand school anymore. every single thing about it is horrible. there is nothing good about it. i hate it. i hope my school gets bombed or shot up. i can not handle this shit anymore.	moderate
things are not getting any better i have done what people told me to do and leave the lives of those who really did not care about me. but, now i am alone. i have no one. truly i have no one. my heart aches from this silence in my body that no one understands. video games are not fun anymore. i can not go out bc i think too much. memes do not make me laugh. i just go to school and act like everything is okay, but it is not. it is not and i hate the fact that it is not. i go to school bc it is the only ti ame in my life that i have people to be with, but after that, i am just a side character. no one cares, truly i can say that with confidence. i am losing reasons to get out of bed everyday that passes, i have never been one to consider even hurting myself. but i just can not stop thinking about why me, out of all people that could have been here, was it me? why was i put on this earth, i do not feel like i even have a purpose. i feel i am just, here. i am not happy, not sad, just, here. it breaks my heart little by little even thinking that, if this does not stop, my parents, siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews, are probably never going to see me again. i do not know what to do. seconds feel like minutes, minutes feel like hours, etc. i try to escape in any way i can, but i just can not, even working and putting money in my pocket is not doing a thing, i do not want to turn to drugs, bc ruining my life is a fate worse than death. i just feel like i am in a hole, with no one watching. waiting for an inevitable death.	moderate

i did mushrooms a week ago i did shrooms for the first ti ame two weeks ago and it was the scariest experience of my life. i was so scared of my thoughts and felt stuck in my head. after that experience i felt completely sad and empty. a week later i decided to do it again but under different circumstances people i was completely comfortable with, did not have to go home, etc and it was the same thing. it made me realize how depressed i was and now i can not get out of my depression. i just feel like i am just watching everyone live and i am just stuck in my head. i dont want to live like this forever and i do not know what to do	moderate

i wi will ki will myself i joined this subbreddit because for the first ti ame of my life i found people with si amilar families to me. i am the usual i guess, divorced parents that sti will hate each other after years of their break up, but this just goes beyond everything i would have ever i amagined. i used to live with my mother and it was hell, no better word to describe it. she used to insult me just for being, calling me a usseles son and an autistic no one, constantly trying to make fun of me and shame me for everything she could, this went on for a couple years, around or so, until finally some months back i snapped, i just could not take it anymore. she started yelling at me for some stupid reason and i just tried to ignore her, but she entered my room and started just trowhing everything she could. my lap top, my ps , my phone, everything she could grab and throw into the wall was thrown. i just wasnt dealing with it anymore, the sadness just was pure madness at that point, i grabbed her and pushed her out of my room while she screamed at me full pshyco. i closed the door and hold it close while she tried to smash it down to get back in my room. she started crying and shouting to me things that i can not quite remember, at this point i was just pushing the door shut while crying. the moment was over whelming, i tried my best to stay as stable as possible but i just felt so much anger and fear at the ti ame. an hour later or so, my father showed up at my house and make me grab my stuff and leave. on the way to his apartment, he only stayed silent while looking at me, and i just tried my best to calm myself. when we arrived, he talked to me, he ask why did i did that and if i was okey with what i did. soon i understood what he meant,my mother had called hi am telling hi am that i had hitt her and that i was just violent against women. my father never talked to me again about that, but afther that day things started to go down fall. i started going to the psychologist after that, my mother signed me up and made my father take me every week for about a month. there the stupid bitch talked to me about things like you should feel angry with women or hitting women is not okay . i hated going, i hated going every week to be treated like a cri aminal, like if i was the one that needed help. after that i started living with my father, since my mother kicked my out of my house i had no where else to go. my room now is a little bed next to where he works. he is a lawyer . a month or so starting to get used to living with hi am i was just broken. i went from hanging out with friends every day and every night to stay away from home as much as possible to stay inside every day whit my ps , eating and doing as much as i could to avoid my friends, since they had no idea nor i have ever told them why i just stopped hanging out with them. since then my life has been a total thisaster i dont want to try to fix anymore. i tried my best to go back to the person that i used to be, but every day its more and more difficult. i was just a normal kid, a year old that would play ps and hang around with friends during the week and go partying some saturdays. now i am just a sad fucker, i sti will hang around with friends but i just dont feel the same anymore, i used to be the one that made everyone laughed and now i am just the one that stays behind silent and laughs a little every now and then. my friends have noticed this but every ti ame someone asks me is everything okay? or are you fine? i just do my best to keep them away, what am i suppoused to say? that my mother is a psycho that kicked me out and my father beats me everythi ame he gets mad at me? i feel so ashamed, i feel so sad and angry, and i have to put all of that behind a mask of na bro, i am fine, just sleepy and pretend i am alright. like i said, my father gets angry at me for almost no reason, he hates that i play ps , he hates that i go partying even tough he knows that i have always been really mature with the alchochol and that i have never ever had problems with it. there are nights where he just arrives from the job and sitts next to me, just to give me a large speech of how pathetic i am and how i wi will always be alone for the kind of person that i am, how no one wi will ever love me and how i wi will be left alone once he kicks me out of the house. i just do my best to cry as silently as possible, pretending that i dont care. all this happened in the summer, so when i had to come back school i am from argentina i had to face my mother again. at my school, wich is the only thing i really care, you have to sitt for an exam to enter another year. this exam is really easy and i have always been a good student so it hasnt ever meant a real deal to me, but this year was different. my mother called my father and told hi am that if i didnt passed this exam she would make sure that i got kicked out of school, so my father made me stay home for two hole weeks studying while my mother called hi am every few hours to check on me . i passed this exam with a a i guess but those weeks were a nightmare, my father was all day yelling at me to keep studying and to focus or i would go to another shitty school. those nights were when all the reason why i write this began, the suicidal thoughts every night since those nights i can not avoid but think about how tired i am, how much i want to die and i really mean it. every day i arrive home knowing that mu father wi will look at me into my eyes and give me that thisaproving stare he always gives me. every night i feel the door opening i drop my phone and pretend to be asleep so he doesnt talks to me. his words are knives into my very soul, i can not have peace anymore. every ti ame i look myself into the mirror i see everything that my father described, everyti ame i have ti ame to think i just hear his words repeating themselves again and again, remembering me what i am and how little i deserve from others i had dreams of being a doctor, i dreamed of finishing the book i was writing and i dreamed of getting to know someone else. watching my ex next holding hands with another dude was like a bullet on a dead body. it hurt, it really did, but at the ti ame i was so fucked up that it meant nothing to me. of course she gets to know someone new, she arrives home with a lovely mother and a care father that both treat her with respect and love. if i didnt had parents that hatted me i would be even better than her, but i am not, i am just a sad fuck that can not get over it and she gets to laugh with her friends about me every ti ame she sees me. last night was when i snapped again. my father came to me while i was having dinner alone and he told me that he doesnt want me to be with hi am anymore. he says that i dont help around the house and that i am just wasting his money and his ti ame. he told me that he is going to send me back with my mother and that i dont get to decide if i wnat it or not. i dont want to go, but i dont want to stay neither. my father does and did horribles things to me, but my mother is just hell to me, i can not deal with it anymore, i wi will not i want to ki will myself, i want to get up right now from the bed and sneek trough his bedroom, i want to go to the roof and jump. i am crying and i can not sleep because i know that deep down i really want to do it. i want help, i just want to hear someone, i dont want to do it even tought it seems the only thing to do. please, i dont want to go to a psychologist and be treated like a cri aminal again. i know that my father wi will not care if i tell hi am how i feel, he wi will just get even more angry at me. i can not go back to my mother, i start shaking just of thinking of it. i need help, i need a way out of this no matter what.	moderate
tired it grows, the void, engulfing me in its darkness. anxious, mind racing, unable to sleep. crying has become a normal thing, no one notices. i can not breathe i am slowly suffocating on emotions. they swallow me whole. every possible scenario runs through my head, constantly churning. when did i become this pitiful? when did my laughter turn to sobs? i can not even remember happiness anymore, just this empty feeling, this pit of loneliness. when i am with people i am sti will completely alone, detached. i am scared, scared of what this means. scared that my life wi will just progressively tumble in the direction it is heading. down. i feel like i am falling, the thought of hitting the ground terrifies me, but i just keep falling into emptiness. the ground never shows itself, wi will someone be there when i hit? doubtful. it is like i am falling from space wi will there be anything left by the ti ame i reach the ground or wi will i burn up and thisappear. i try, really hard, to change my perception, to look on the brighter side, but i am always pushed pulled back to this space. this mindset. i am tired of faking it. i am tired of being forgotten. i am tired of watching people slowly thistance themselves from me. i am tired of always feeling alone. i am tired of failing. i am tired of trying. i am tired of falling. i am just tired.	moderate

i am over everything. if you do not want to read a lot please do not even bother. anyways, lately, these past few months have been so bad for me again. i want to ki will myself again but i am really out of options now nobody trusts me with anything anymore since i have tried so many ti ames. i am just over everything. i try everything i can to rid myself of this endless feeling of suffering and pain but i can not. i can not drink it away i can not smoke it away i can not go out enough i can never sleep i am alone most of the ti ame because of my boyfriends work schedule but i know he does not love me and is probably cheating on me anyways. i want to be happy. i really do. but everything seems so pointless. as the days go by i feel like i am losing my mind. i feel so empty. i have so much emotion yet i can never find a way to express it words do not come to mind. i feel like i am just always spacing out and watching myself from an outside perspective. i have at least breakdowns a day. i am always just sad or angry. everything pisses me off but also everything means nothing to me. i just feel so sick and tired of living and i know that nobody cares about me nobody would care if i did anything. nobody is here to help i have nowhere to go i have been through so much these past years and i just want to take a breather for once but i just can not seem to. every day that i breathe seems to add more weight on my shoulder. i am never happy and everyone around me seems to push away because of it. if i am around people i just bring them down and it is getting exhausting having to often fake how i am feeling. i stay in my room everyday because i can not find the motivation to leave it or even to eat. i wish i knew what to do. i wish i could just ki will myself and not hurt anybody. i just wish i could rant about everything. someti ames i feel i am being dramatic , and my boyfriend always says at least i have a roof over my head and food and water and a bed etc...but i for some reason can not live with just that. i want happiness. i crave it so badly. but yet all i ever feel is sadness and emptiness and anger and betrayal, thisappointment, so many things at once. but i have no outlet. i do not know why i came to write this. maybe just to let it out? i do not know where else to do this. sorry for wasting ti ame if you read this.	moderate

girl i loved and loved me back for a short while basically kicked me to the curb and showed she did not give two shits about me. she was everything to me and i was nothing to her. i do not have anyone and do not know how much longer i can go on. i would have done anything for this girl, she was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen, her eyes were big and full of life and always had a shine in them and were worthing looking into for eternity, her smile was tiny but i would do anything to see it one more ti ame, she had long beautiful brown hair that accentuated her pretty face. i would tell her this everyday when we started talking, and then one day she lost complete interest, she stopped messaging me as much, and then the next day came and the next, and we stopped talking completely. she told me she loved me back, she told me she liked me, and then today she did not give two shits about how i felt. how can someone you love be so cruel. i feel like i wi will never meet anyone as beautiful and caring as her, i wi will never find someone i love as much as i love her, i do not know what the point in even staying alive is. before i met her i was looking into buying a gun, now i think i might continue that plan.	moderate

i honestly think the world would be better off without me. i just want to die. i want the pain to end. my life just keeps spiraling. i feel so alone. i am alone. i feel so used and hurt. i am only good enough for people when they can take something from me or use me but are never around when i try so hard to reach out for them or ask for help. i open up to people i feel i can trust after a long ti ame and they always leave. they always thistance themselves. they always show less and less and less interest in me until they ignore my texts or avoid me at work or do what they can to be away from me. it is like i have some sort of infectious thisease and they do not want to catch it. no one ever takes my emotions seriously. i try to explain i am depressed or that i want to ki will myself or i am hurting so bad and i am ignored or my feelings are made invalid or i am told you re too pretty to be depressed, like my appearance has anything to do with how i feel on the inside. i am a thisappointment to my family. i never seem to do right by them. i am always fucking things up or doing things they do not like and ruining everything. i ruin a lot of things for a lot of people it seems, and i ruin things at work. i am struggling meeting my quotas. no one seems to notice that something is wrong. i am just told to bring my numbers up and smile. no one wants to listen to what i say. i have relapsed. i have been starving myself again, and i have been cutting. but i am scared of myself. because the cutting and the starving is not enough anymore. i want to do more to hurt myself and i worry i wi will ki will myself. i want to ki will myself. but i do not want anyone to clean up the mess. i do not want the last thing i do to be just another burden for someone else. i do not know what to do anymore. i just want the pain to stop. i want everything to stop. i want to be numb. i want to die.	moderate

tw a note for my sadness i feel empty a lot, i want to cry but can not. i feel trapped a lot, and think taking my life would be the solution. i want to end it because i want my father to feel it and hope he knows its his fault. he is never around and has other kids, he does not care about me, he did some fucked up shit to my mom and now shes stuck here. i dont hate my mom but i think she does not help with my depression and anxiety, she does not care to do much. my brother is an ass but i also thinks hes fucked up because of the toxic home we live in. i want to die, i just turned and i dont think i will make it to or even and a half. i go to community college and i hate it so much but my dad has other kids he keeps having with another women and he just does not care to put money towards my education. i hate it here and i want to run away. i have no money and no where to go. i just want to die.	moderate
i can not hide from myself it comes and goes with the seasons so i at least get a little taste of reality before becoming lost in my mind again. i have matured and my beliefs have changed but depression is emotional and so it is hard to rationalize with. i used to be sad that i havent had sex and i am now. but honestly its not a big deal, at least not to me and if someone else decides otherwise, fuck them its my life. my depression isnt really based on thought processes as much anymore its just a deep feeling of loneliness. it drove me to a massive drug binge with lots of acid every week for about a year and a half, then a short but intense benzo binge. acid probably taught me a lot that i take for granted, but i know it taught me one thing, i can not answer these questions with anything that quick. it wi will always be a slow, painful and confusing process with some beautiful moments. the benzos stop me from feeling for months. i dont remember a lot of it. during my first semester of college i was almost entirely unconscious. i was effectively the living dead. and then i almost died for good. my friend told me my heart had stopped briefly. but came back as the drugs wore off in ti ame for me to survive. since then i can not explain it but ive changed drastically, in some good ways in some bad. i feel as though i did die and this is the new life i am living. and i often have a sensation that a part of me is sti will in the other world , again hard to explain. but to be frank i saw nothing, just a peaceful unconsciousness. but if theres one thing ive learned, its that no tiny brained human such as me could ever truly understand the nature of life and death, so i am going to stop right their and let mystery be mystery. the depression is coming back even though i am different now. its become blatantly obvious to me that these things ive felt for so long can not be solved with things on the outside. not even the embrace of a lover. i have spent so much ti ame chasing a dream because reality was never enough. in the end i can not hide from myself or my nature, for it is what shapes my existence. and as far as i can tell death is the ulti amate darkness. for that reason i no longer believe death is better than life. and ive realized its better to experience pain than nothing. you dont get what you want. and you dont know what you need until you have found it. i hope i find that one day.	moderate

a bad week i woke up on sunday on hives that progressively got worse and have been coming and going. when i went to the doctor, they just told me to take allergy pi wills because it looks like it is from contact and should go away. the hives have sti will been flaring up and thisappearing, and its usually covers at least one set of li ambs, if not my entire body, including my face. i have been having a more depressed week than usual, and i am currently crying for no reason, and have not been able to dig up any motivation to do school work, or anything in general, and i think i am on the verge of failing my classes. i applied for a position that is a step up from my current position, and even for internal candidates, we re required to go through the hiring process again, and i went into my interview today, and kept getting called out for being off topic, for not actively listening i asked what their names were at the end of the interview because i do not remember them introducing themselves at all , and i am worried that i failed this interview, which means that i would not get the new job which is fine, but i am worried that because i did not so well on the interview, i wi will be fired from my current job as well. i am currently in bed, crying and wondering why i am alive, and why i did not ki will myself last year, when i was so damn close. instead, i reached out for help, only to be abandoned by counsellors, psychiatrists and organizations that i have been connected because they feel like i am doing well enough to not need their resources.	moderate
i hate when people tell me that they care, everything wi will get better and i should just vent. no. it does not work like that. i have been living with those lies for my whole life. this is fucking bullshit. i have been through countless surgeries which made my life only worse. i have been through bullying. i have been through verbal and physical abuse. i have been through shitty situations if you do not count my life as one big shitty situation already . and lastly, i have been through a loss of a friend. she might have ki willed herself, but i do not know if it actually happened. she just told me about her planning another suicide attempt one day, and suddenly cut all ties another day. this was my biggest loss yet. i hate when people tell me to vent. everyti ame i tell someone about my problems, my feelings, my past, i fucking hate myself. it feels like i relive every situation i tell people about. it hurts. this is the worst thing you can tell me. no kinds of insults, bullying or even abuse can do so much damage to me. no one cares. it would not get better. i have been waiting for better days for years. seems like they wi will be only after i put myself out of misery.	moderate

it started again... after counseling with my psychologist for a good six months and having restored my self confidence and esteem, i told myself that it would be a good idea, after two years of being single, to start flirting and stuff. after a couple of days my high school sweetheart that i never expressed my feelings texted, saying that we lost contact and proposed that we should go for a glass of wine. me being the stupid bloody idiot that i am accepted without thinking. having arrived at the wine bar and having drank the first bottle, we talked endlessly, recapping the last years old our lives, and eventually reaching the point in the conversation about our love life. we talked and then i thought it would be a good idea to express my feelings. it was not a bloody good idea. she rejected me by saying hah you? first of all you re fat! and bloody hell at that moment i wished for the floor to open up and swallow me. so i pretended there was a work emergency, paid for the wine and fled like a little bloody cunt. it is been days since that happened. i have not been sober after that. i am always drinking, day and night. girls and ladies i would love your opinion on the matter p.s. i know i am chubby i am on a program to lose weight and i am doing my best	moderate

steps the the end welp... idk where to post this, but i need an outlet or just express myself, cause i dont want the people wondering why this freak with a smile everyday doesnt want to be here , and help me cope with myself a little, so has anyone else ever set up things to achieve before they can really call it a quits? so i decided about year ago that if i can not feel happy or stop feeling numb before i finish my goal of to have a house and cars, and all the debts i owe are paid before i can really enjoy life then ifs game over, it is funny to think i set these goals in order to concentrate on in order to move forward with a thistraction. but it is kinda crazy how much you can accomplish in a year. the reason i came up with this route is to better myself, and if i got back to the old me. i could just keep walking like nothing happened. the main reason i did this is because i am tired at , i wi will be even more tired at . i do not want one thing to just make me say that one small thing hurt me now i am done cause i think that would be dumb of me. if yall can relate or even understand, that would make me at least feel less alone. kinda scary being alone, and never understood.	moderate

depression is real. i grew up in a super restrictive religion. finally broke free at the age of . at the same ti ame my wife left me. i have been floating through life trying to figure it out for the past year. she is sti will the only woman i have been with sexually. social media and technology has ruined dating, it was so much easier years ago. all i get is rejection and i go out trying to meet people day a week. all the women i meet in my city are over and do not want anything to do with me once they find out i am in my s. i am a nice guy who lives a healthy and active lifestyle. i maintain good grooming and hygiene. i go to the gym daily. i do fun things to experience the beauty of life. but nobody wants me. nobody wants to share in my joy. someti ames i wonder who would even notice if i died. my family never calls me. i am living alone in a different state. working from home due to the coronavirus. i have no real friends. i can not even get a woman to go on a date with me. i feel like dating is hopeless. all i want is someone to care about and someone that cares about me. i gave my exwife my all but she did not reciprocate it. it was almost obligatory because of the religion. recently i found a great thistraction with edm music. i was even stoked for months to go to my first rave festival next weekend, which got cancelled for the goddamn coronavirus. i am fucking depressed and have nothing to look forward to. i do not know if my life wi will ever turn out well. i do not know what to do to finally find peace and happiness in this life. wi will i ever get to experience all that life has to offer? i try so hard but get no progress ever. i thought i learned to love myself and enjoy being wi tv myself because i do awesome things. but it does not change what i want deep inside a real relationship with another human being. either a friendship but preferably a girlfriend. why does dating suck in ? why has technology ruined human interaction? was amazing in college so many strangers would say hi to you on the paths walking to class. i took two years off. i return in and on the sidewalks everyone is staring at their phones and nobody says hi anymore. yesterday i went to the grocery store and had a smile on and tried to make conversation and nobody wanted it. i have no sense of community. who lives in all these houses in my neighborhood and how do i get to know them? it is fucking depressing, the world we live in.	moderate

fired today today i was fired from my dream job where i have worked for years. i unfortunately made a comment on social media regarding my political opinions on my private account. however, a coworker was offended by my comment, took a photo of my profile and the comment, and sent it to our hr department. i was i ammediately let go because my opinion did not match that of my company. i did not bash my company or anyone in anyway, it was just how i felt regarding a national policy. however, my company sti will decided my opinion did match theirs and terminated me i ammediately. my job was the only thing i have. luckily i am in an industry where there are a lot of opportunities. but i actually woke up looking forward to what i did. it was my calling and my life. my job was the only thing i had in my life. my boss teared up as she fired me, as we had a very strong professional relationship friendship, but it was unfortunately a corporate social media policy. she fought upper level management and defended me, but it was not her final say. i must have looked like a sad puppy, i thanked her for the experience, told her no hard feelings towards her as this was my mistake, and held back tears as i handed in my badge and left the building. i broke down and hyperventilated in my car and felt physically i will. this was my first social media post in a year and i was feeling passionate and wanted to share my voice, a lot of my friends and strangers supported my opinion, but sadly my company thisagreed. now i have nothing. i have an overwhelming amount of support from friends and other coworkers, but i feel so ashamed, embarrassed, and hurt that someone hated me enough to try and sabotage my career and it worked. i have always seen the good in people and have never intentionally hurt anyone else. i have never hated anyone in my life, but right now i truly hate this person, whoever they are. i have a chronic i willness and wi will not be able to afford my treatments, i love my home and wi will not be able to pay my rent now. my life just did a complete . i know in ti ame things wi will get better and i wi will land on my feet, but i feel like a piece of human garbage right now. i can not stop crying and i have some very dark thoughts about ways i could hurt myself and that i deserve to suffer. i wish i could go back in ti ame and take my worlds back. i do not know what i am looking for right now, i guess i just need support, and advice from anyone who has maybe been through something si amilar. or even just virtual hugs	moderate
already done with life and i am only a teen life has just been rough, i understand it is for everyone but not everyone is mentally prepared for it especially at a young age. god tested me at a young age and i failed, miserably. i was and my dad told me my brother shot hi amself, a few months later my dad had a heart attack and heart failure and i am not able to see hi am. few months go by and my parents split up, my dad stays in a hotel and my mom is selling the house, lose most of my childhood friends due to moving and now life is just, plain. not even boring, just emotionless and flat. no where to go and nothing to do, spending my days in solitaire waiting for good news. at this point i have put all my faith in nothing and of course received nothing in return as that is just the way life goes for most of us. multiple relationships went bad not on my part, but just being under appreciated and lead on. my life is being picked now i would hope with a few friends and an old friend reconnecting with me, its been about years since we became friends again and its hard to tell hi am about my emotions without feeling like i wi will push hi am away. on top of this my mom is sti will dating the man who she slept with when she cheated and that man is the uncle to my brothers last girlfriend who cheated on hi am multiple ti ames, most likely causing hi am to become depressed. there family is evil and tried hiding evidence from me and my father about his suicides cause, by throwing away his suicide notes. at this point i dont know who to trust and what to look up for, i dont even know why i am writing this. i am only and already lost in the sick game of life	moderate

does not feel too good. i wished someone would thank me for being alive, i wished someone would catch me when i was falling, i wish someone would tell me it was going to be okay. my life is become so sad, today i failed again a number on a paper that sticks in my head defining me. today i realized i had never been happy... with myself i never laughed with myself never told myself i was the reason i was going to wake up happy being me. i was happy because i could see others happy, i was happy because i could make them smile and laugh. in the world we live in the ones who make others laugh are assumed to be the happiest which could not be further from the truth, as i write this, i think about what has made me live for so long. and i concluded that it was seeing others have something that i could only share. it is sad to me. i never thought i was smart, i never wanted to be classified, but you gather people with common interests, and those are the people around me smart ones at that. i never realised but admitting to them i was not like them would be the hardest, i did not want to live a life of lies, telling myself i was like them, but i did not want them to leave feeling they wouldn t accept me, at least i felt like they wouldn t . home is not easy either but it is what it is, i always knew we weren t rich but i was grateful, i did not ask for much did not get much too eat and that is how i lived, but dad would always compare to the geniuses the kids who graduated uni at like or whatnot with what he believed was no assistance he talked i will of tutoring which is popular in my area. not having the extra guidance others had always placed me behind them. embarrassed he asked if i wanted to go tutoring as he realized most of his friends sent their children, but i could see his intentions were to force my mouth and say i did not, as he was always belittling those whoever asked for help in life or weren t just naturally gifted which is what he thought to be the cause of intellect. i knew that if i performed poorly even with hi am spending the already low amount of money we had i would become the thisappointment of the family, with a lack of esteem and confidence i did not take up his offer fearing the shame to come. yet the next day i wake up and continue living, fearing to fix the issues i face.	moderate

brief vent of a long issue chronic depression takes many colors and smells. it stays for you for so long so it evolves as yourself. chronic depression can be a flower ish social butterfly, a dusty writer, a goner punk or an emotional retro artist. it mixes up with your favorite songs, your hideouts, your likes and thislikes. and if you do not separate ways you ll see someone besides you. much like yourself jus rotting away.	moderate
i can not even articulate how fucking angry i am at everything right now. i do not even want to elaborate too much. i am angry because i am angry in the first place. this constant need for validation and love from people that do not matter needs to stop. but it wi will never stop. it is a never ending cycle of feeling lonely, seeking friendship, realizing you can not make people like you, and severing ties with a community that did not care and probably did not even know you. rinse and fucking repeat. it is all so fucking pointless. the worst part is, i do not even know what to do with myself after leaving. i do not matter to these people yet i am obsessed with them. what is wrong with me? i need to know where everything went wrong. this mixture of low self esteem and idolization of others is lethal to me. i can not deal with this shit. i need a thistraction. i need to focus on the people that are actually in my life. i need to spend less ti ame online. i need to fucking die someti ames.	moderate
everything is a struggle i swear i live my whole life just struggling to find the motivation to do whatever comes next. i wake up every morning and decide i would rather sleep another minutes than brush my teeth. i decide it is better to sleep a few more minutes than to pack a lunch that day. when i finally get to school i do not want to leave the parking lot. i struggle every day to make the decision to go to school when i just want to stay in my car and listen to music. the whole day goes like that. i even find myself struggling to find the motivation to go to bed. as much as i want to sleep, i stay up all hours of the night delaying the inevitable beginning of tomorrow.	moderate
ahh here we go again. the corona virus. i am not allowed to go to school, or out for that matter for days. a whole month. i thought, maybe days of free ti ame wi will allow me to i amprove myself learn new ski wills and such. the problem is one of the major triggers for my depressive episodes is isolation. my group of friends are the reason i have been recovering. now that i can not see them for a month i am honestly scared. it is been four days now, and it does not feel that bad yet. i just remember the last ti ame i had a huge depressive episode due to isolation, and it is pretty traumatic. i gained weight, had social anxiety, could barely talk or move around. like i was glued to the bed. i hope this ti ame it is different. if it hits again i do not know what wi will happen, what i am going to think, whether i am going to start harming myself again. myself right now thinks and views life different from myself in a depressive episode. it is scary because it is like that is a completelt different person that i can not control. so i have to prevent it. i need to see someone i know. thirty more days to go and then life wi will be back to normal.. hopefully.	moderate
everything i just can not think clearly right now, so i need to say it. at some point i needed to say it. i do not know if you reading this knows me, or your trying to size me up, or if you re just a stranger passing by looking for, i do not know, whatever, but i am about to just say everything about me. as much as i can at least. all of my worst and everything. i just needed clear my head. this is probably going to be a long one as a basis i need to start by saying, i do not know what is wrong with me, like if everything i think is because i actually have some sort of problem or if i am just faking it? who knows. maybe i am just faking it for whatever reason, because it is a lot easier for me to pretend something is inherently wrong with me and not that my actions are the direct cause of how i feel, which they are, but sti will the thought that i am not in control makes me feel a bit better? who knows what i do know is that i am definitely not normal. i have always felt a diluted sense of emotions. someti ames i am just unable to truly feel, and i doubt whether the emotions i do feel are real or figments that is i have conjured up. i am definitely an apathetic person, without care for really anything, having to force myself to care about goals or people. and so i find it difficult to empathize with others, in fact i find it i ampossible to truly connect with others. because i do not care about the people i should care about. i have a long history of hurting those i care about, abandoning them or saying hurtful things because i want to see them hurting. i do not really know why. maybe i am just psychotic. but i never truly felt bad for others even when i know i should. i just do not feel capable of caring about people. but i am not entirely emotionless either apparently i can not even commit to that . i do feel severe guilt in honesty. i feel guilt that i do not care as much as i should. i feel melancholy when i realize i do not have as strong of a connection to people as i should. i wish i could just have normal attachments and senti aments to people but, people come and go, and i si amply could not care in the slightest. but it hurts me to realize that. to realize that i should care but i do not. and i feel pity for those who care. which is why i try pushing people away. because i do not want to hurt them, but i know i wi will. so i keep them away from me so they do not have to hurt. whether if that is because i do care about their feelings or to si amply avoid feeling guilty i do not know, but that is the way it is. so if you know me and your reading this, i am sorry for, everything i know i have done. for turning my back, for thisappearing, for being unable to help you, or for hurting you, i am sorry i refuse your attempts at trying to get close or trying to be genuine or trying to help me. i just do not want you to get hurt. but that is just the people. that is just my emotions and my sociable aspects of all the shit. of course it can not be that si ample, there is much much more. where does the apathy come from however? in short, i am unable to care for others and for even myself, because i do not feel attached to anything. i mean i literally do not feel attached to myself. for visual reference is feels like i am a ghost attached to a host which is my body. i feel a strange thisconnect to myself and to the world. i feel as though i am not the person i see in the mirror. almost as if i am si amply an observer of my own world, of my own story. i feel like i have no true control but only the i willusion of control. i feel trapped and i feel detached. someti ames i even feel physically detached. someti ames i feel as if i am being pulled apart from my body, i feel lighter and i feel numb and cold. so it feels like i am not me if that makes sense. so how am i supposed to be attached to things in a world that does not seem real? it feels like i am reading a story, i read the lives of these characters and for a ti ame, i enjoy it and i care for these people. however it is a fake emotion, because these people si amply are not real, they are fictional characters in a fantasy world. that is what everything feels like to me, like everything does not matter because it is all fake, because it feels like it is all fake, so why should i give a shit? and the apathy is one of the worst things. it makes me unmotivated and it makes me not do the things i do want to do. i can not solve any of my problems because i do not care enough to try. i waste every opportunity handed to me because i could not give a shit. so not only am i a mental fucking mess, i am also just a shitty person. a person who both, does not care about others, and does not contribute. and it is not as if i can not achieve. so much feels as if i can accomplish without trying, how i made it thus far. i have managed my way through school without even trying, usually doing better than a lot of the students. i am and always have been able to learn quickly and i could have been an amazing student, however i do not care enough to make that a reality. so many ti ames teachers tell me of my potential, that wasted potential i was given that i refuse to do anything about. because i si amply do not give a shit about myself or others to make it a reality. and so i waste ti ame, and i waste resources, and i am a waste of just everything ever handed to me. i refuse to let others waste their ti ame on me because i do not see the point. i hate when people try to help me because i would not change, because i do not care enough to change. so if you read this and think you want to try and give me advice or try and save me , do not, because you ll just waste your breath. it would not change me, because i do not want to change, i think of myself as too much of a waste to get help. i am too far gone, it is too late. so please. save yourself the bother, do not even try to help me. that goes for both strangers and my friends. even now i am getting tired of writing this, because i know it does not matter, it is just me talking to no one. if you re actually reading this, and for some reason you care, do not, because i do not even care so why should you? i know it is just me rambling, it does not even make sense probably. i am speaking to the void, to an audience i do not know. it does not matter anyways. there is so much i want to say so many thoughts but i just do not know what they are they over take me. so this is not everything as i wanted it to be but i guess it is enough. it does not matter however i want to leave with one last note, one i amportant thing i just need to say. i do not know how i have made it this far. i do not know why i have made it this far. i do not know why i wake up or what i am planning on going for or how long i am going but i just keep going. i have tried to ki will myself. even now i want to ki will myself. i want to grab a rope and walk into the woods, and never come out. it is just the way i feel. i am tired of living a life where i am not happy, and i am not going to be happy, where i do not care and i would not care, where there is nothing and there is going to be nothing. what is the point! i want to thisappear, i wish i could just stop. i wish i had died to those pi will all those years ago, i wish the rope had not snapped i wish i could just do it. but i am too much of a coward. because i know i need to die and that it is fruitless to keep going but i just do not. i do not know what the point of any of this is. the letter or my life. i just want to die. that is what i truly feel. is a constant craving for death.	moderate

life sucks tl dr every ti ame i take a step forward i end up making step backwards and i am tired of it. p.s. apologize beforehand for all the grammar and spelling mistakes. chapter leaving the swamp i was born in a small russian ghost town called amursk back in . as i grew up i have witnessed the town falling apart and everyone leaving. my mom was one of those people. being a decent english speaker she decided to move to the us in an attempt to start a new life. before she left she promised to me and my grandma that she wi will get us out of there. however, it would be years until her promise would be fulfi willed. my town was not the only thing failing to succeed. i was a bad test taker and my grades were awful. my grandma was a regular visitor in my principal is office. i hated my life and started hanging with the wrong people just to feel the sense of belonging and approval. finally, on september of , me and my grandma get a call from my mom saying that she got married, found a stable job and has already bought us tickets to the united states. our excitement was i ammeasurable. after all these years i thought that i would finally stop being a loser and become a new, better version of myself. i was never so wrong in my entire life... chapter melting pressure during the first months of me being here, my mom and my stepdad send an application to a local high school. my stepdad is from trinidad and tobago and has seen what the lack of education can lead to. he was very i ampatient with me going to high school as soon as possible. i was super stressed out. i did not know a whole lot of english i did not have any friends over here i did not know the culture and the expectations that american teens had. being a bad test taker and being pissed by the apathy that a lot of teachers had towards their students i decided to cheat. my logic was that if you do not want to bother putting any energy in gettin your students interested i am not going to put any energy in studying your material. miraculously, i managed to graduate the high school. now there was another challenge going to college. i took sats in the following months after my graduation and i failed every single one of them. after my final sat i said fuck it and decided to join the army. if i can not work with my brain let us see if i can work my muscles. my parents weren t too happy about me joining, but they understood the lack of other options. chapter sweat and sorrow turns out i suck at being a soldier as well. i barely graduated bct basic combat training with all the mini amum requirements. less pushup or sit up or seconds more on the run and i would fail. from that point i already knew that the chance of me graduating ait advanced individual training was not too high either. i was right. on october , i got a knock on the door from my dri will sergeant saying that i wi will not participate in the graduating ceremony both of us already knew that, he just had to make it official . the process of being thischarged is not quick and it takes weeks, someti ames months. during this tiem i met a guy who offered me to move to nebraska to live with hi am and other roommates. he was living with his parents, i was living with mine and i did not sound like a bad option. i agreed. he left weeks before me and before he left we exchanged the numbers. chapter great plains are not so great after all after i got home, my parents were both happy and thissapointed. there was an unpleasant feeling of uncertainty in the house that none of us liked. after giving myself a couple of days to rest, i decided to call hi am the guy i met in the army and ask if he is sti will down to move out. he says yes. after a short conversation with my parents we decided that maybe starting over in a new state wi will help somehow. i bought a plane ticket the same day and was gone within a week. i moved in, i got my ne id, found a job. everything was fine at first and for the first ti ame i thought that maybe something wi will finally work out. unfortunately, i wouldn t be writing this post if everything went fine. after living together for months we me and my roommates started to get into conflicts and thisputes. it reached it is cli amax on march , when my buddy started spreading rumors about me and had enough of it. i told hi am that if he does not stop, bad things wi will happen. he did not stop. that evening me, hi am, and another roommate got into a huge fight. fucked up all of the living room, threw a couple of thishes at one another, etc. to put it shortly, after the fight was over all we wanted to do was to ki will one another. i had to move out. i had to go back again. chapter present i am so fuckin tired of everything. my life is a chain of bad decisions and poor executions and i am so done with it. i had hopes and aspirations, but now i have none of it. everything seems meaningless at this point. i am tired of taking life is challenges and not getting anything in return. fuck this shit.	moderate

have not left the house in two months...but i am sick, again. i was just laying in bed attempting to sleep, and am unable to because i am so focused on a dry scratchiness in the back of my throat. i can not think of a ti ame where i have felt this kind of feeling and it was not a precursor to me getting sick. i have been feeling off and weak all day, but i go through a lot of drops in energy so i did not think anything of it. i just had the flu a few weeks ago. so twice within a two month period where i did not even leave the house i am getting sick. i bitch a lot, i feel my life is unfair a lot, but this is utterly unfair. i am used to getting sick about once every three years and it is usually mild, twice in two months is unheard of for me. naturally i have to wonder if it is the coronavirus, i saw news that it is here in my city. two months in isolation has burned through my food stores, i am pretty much down to canned beets and peas at this point. going to be a rough ride if i am getting sick as i expect. i am already struggling to make rent, i really can not be taken out of commission right now.	moderate
life is just very bland, to an uncomfortable, empty degree so, for some back context i am , male, i live with my girlfriend, , and i left home to move across the country for work new zealand, moved from wellington to tauranga, basically km away from where i grew up, all my family and friends . things have been up and down, but despite days where things are good, things also feel highly negative anyway. for example, today i spent hours cleaning my car by hand, polishing, waxing, etc and it felt good to clean it up. as most of you may know, when you get into a slump your environments tend to fall down into a mess with you. so it felt good to tidy it up finally. despite that, i do not feel accomplished, i do not feel happy, partly stems from finding out my girlfriend had been lying to me for months about her smoking habit, and despite switching to a vape to restart quitting for real this ti ame i sti will feel extremely stuck on that. not hate, just another thing contributing to this overall bland feeling that things are just happening around me in life and i am not really involved in it. i have good hours at work, my boss is amazingly understanding, i have a family wedding approaching in weeks. yet all of it i feel increasingly detached from. it is hard to describe, i do not feel like crying, i do not feel like suicide, i do not feel like self harm, i just feel empty, unattached to anything going on, it does not matter if i act in situations because bad things occur anyway like i do not exist in my friendships and relationship, so i feel like if i just stop existing nothing would alter, nobody would be affected, like i was never there in the first place. i have good days, nothing goes wrong at all, but sti will i do not feel happy i do not feel good it is just a day where nothing overly bad happened so it is classified as good. i have lost all motivation to show up to my job, i do the bare mini amum to pay my rent and bi wills then i call sick and i am ashamed of it, i hate being at home but if i show up to work all that happens is i get a panic attack, crawl into the bathroom and have a breakdown for half an hour and everyone questions it. i can not even bother to take myself out anywhere, unless it is i amportant i shut any idea i have down and just sit in bed. all of it just gets hit with what is the point i will just be using my ti ame being sad and moody elsewhere so why bother going out just needed a rant really, all my friends i had here in town were workmates who have now quit for university and moved away, the new hires do not speak english and are older, my girlfriend is here but she has her own issues and unloading all my unhappiness on her wi will just make more issues than it wi will help because nobody can fix me, except myself and my own motivation to get out of this rut. i just wish i had a circle to come drag me out of the house, or people on thiscord to game with, literally any form of contact to fi will my ti ame in with and rethiscover love for doing things. hopefully things pick up soon	moderate

just tired of trying it has been long years since my breakdown and i guess i am tired of trying to keep afloat every single day. some days, like today, i do not know if i have it in me to keep going. the depression consumes you and you can not figure out which way to turn. i am tired of trying to find thistractions. i am tired of trying to keep friendships going. trying to find people that understand. i am tired of trying to function like a normal person whatever that means. you know, do normal things like chores, grocery shopping, exercise, eat healthily, sleep etc. i am tired of trying to convince myself that i am worthy of love. worthy of a relationship. worthy of having someone in my life that loves me just the way i am because i do not love myself as i am that is for sure. i am tired of fighting anxiety every minute of the day. i am tired of the persistent voice of self doubt and self hate. i am tired of trying to work at the few relationships i do have. i am tired of looking for work. there is more, i am sure, but i wi will stop now. i am not physically exhausted i am mentally tired. does anyone relate?	moderate

wouldn t crack a smile if i won a tri willion dollars. there is nothing fucking great about that at least to me. why get it so i can get a shitty house to stay in all day to just watch my fucking fictional shows alone since i hate everyone. or get a super expensive car just so i can just flex on poor people and just drive pretty much nowhere since i hate every place and am thisgusted by every person myself included . i could not care less about fucking clothes or being stylish because it is unnecessary and i am not trying to attract attention to myself or get a fucking girlfriend anymore. could not care less about traveling this shitty smelly thiseased world just to see some different buildings, people, and also cultures that i do not understand. i have seen and experienced enough of this world and this world can use less humans anyway. i hate existing and the fucking feeling of it and sadly after i die i am probably going to be reborn as some strange thing in the universe or somewhere in existence. if popping up from non existence can happen one ti ame it can definitely happen another ti ame and possibly infinite ti ames after that sadly.	moderate
how to cope with the i ampeding death of my dog with heart thisease sorry already for any grammar issues, english is not my native language. last weekend my year old chihuahua was feeling down and just sleeping, not eating. i had to take hi am to the vet during the night because his condition deteriorated. the vet took blood and x rays and said his heart murmur was very strong and i needed to come on tuesday for an ultrasound for his heart. i suffer from depression and anxiety and my boy is my world, he is my support and friend. he got some medication and felt better, so we could safely wait until tuesday to get the exam done. after the ultrasound the vet said that he had a condition very normal for senior chihuahuas, his heart was enlarged and during pumping the blood was leaking in the left ventricle. the vet said with four medications his condition would become stable but that he only had one year left until he would be getting breathing issues, fainting and other things common for heart failure. i was devastated and cried. these past nights have been horrible. i can not sleep or eat and i have seen three nightmares, all the same my dog is dying and i am screaming his name but can not get to hi am and i just hear his whi ampering and see his eyes. i wake up in cold sweat and check that he is sti will breathing. i feel lost. i did not know his i ampeding death would be this difficult for me to accept, before this i at least was understanding of the fact that he is a senior dog and some day he too wi will pass. i do not know what to do. he is now happy and energetic again with the medication but i have a fear that one day in the near future i wi will come home and he is dead. if you have had the same situation with your dog, how fast did his condition deteriorate with heart failure and was anything helpful with coping with the loss?	moderate
i ghosted everybody and i feel amazing well, maybe amazing is too much. but i feel so much better. i deleted all my social media aside from reddit, no one in my life knows of this account . without all the added pressure of pretending i am okay, talking to acquaintances that really do not give a shit about you, and constantly having to see how good everyone else is lives are, i feel like i am free. the few people that care text me, and that is all i really need. although i am sti will struggling with a lot of anxiety and depression, i feel like the ton of bricks that was sitting on my chest turned into a small pile. just wanted to vent and share my thoughts, if anyone has any si amilar experiences and some tips for the future, i would love to hear them!	moderate

i am about to give up. i do not know if i am suicidal but i am so jaded that i do not care if i wi will live or die. i just accepted that my childhood dream of being a filmmaker wi will never happen. i never really pursued it because of lack of money. i finally bought a camera when i was and i got into so much shit with my family because it was money that could have been spent on other things. and when i looked into doing paid work in cinema i realized it would take several months to years of unpaid work to go after it and my mom needed me to pay bi wills now. at , the age i should have been trying to start my life, i was expected to pay off the house that we were living in which of course no one at could possibly do. we lost the house anyway and i am now almost and i sti will share a room with my brother. i sti will get guilted into not moving out because my mom can not afford rent without me. i am basically in a pickle where i can not afford to make my mom and myself happy so i chose my mom is happiness. and i feel like living in orange county is just extra salt in the wounds. it is so close to los angeles where the film industry is centered in yet it is inconveniently far enough that my busy work schedule i work a safe office job that drains me of my mental energy and i have only gotten stupider since taking it makes it too difficult to actually be there. and the only way i can describe the oc is that it is los angeles for people who think mayo is spicy and their favorite artist is hootie and blowfish. i refuse to date at this point because i can not look at myself in the mirror. i hate myself for just giving up on my childhood dreams and i do not feel worthy of being loved. this is not a life i would want to share with anyone. i do not know what else to write. i know that i would not ki will myself but if i knew growing up that this is how my life would turn out i probably would have. and i did try making youtube videos with friends but it never happened because of scheduling and friends suddenly thinking they were too talented for me when all they did was get a few roles as an extra. i do not know where i am going to go from here. i just feel like i fell into a rough current and i do not care what happens from this point on.	moderate

my family and i got kicked out of our apartment and i realise how useless i have become. a couple weeks ago we got asked to leave our apartment of which we have been renting from for years. a little backstory, i am and have not regularily gone to school for and a half years. i had to go to court for it every year until i turned , through that ti ame i went to many different psychologists, was on probation for a year and finally started taking medication! for the past year i have been feeling much better and stopped considering self harm as an option. fast forward to the present and i am sleeping in the basement living room of my grandparents house. no job, no school and only grade education. i keep thinking about where to go from here and how much ti ame i have wasted. i am going to stop worrying about proper grammer now cause its too tiring recently i have been feeling a decline in my cognitive ability and memory and that really scares me. i keep trying to think of some kind of job i can do but most ti ames i finally get the courage to apply i read highschool diploma or higher. then i go back to wallowing in self pity and feeling sorry for myself. i hate how little i exercise i get but everyti ame i try to do it i miss a day or two and quit. i can not even enjoy gaming with my friends most days now and i feel like i have no redeeming qualities. i am unhappy with my weight and i feel like a thissapointment to my family who are super supportive of me considering how useless i am. anyway the point is i am , i can barely take care of myself and i am terrified of the future. any advice?	moderate

my wife left me. we were together for years. everything seemed good. she seemed like her happy normal self leading up to it. even on the morning it happened i was getting ready for work she kinda awoke smiled at me said said she loved me and to have a good day. then hours later i got the text saying she was leaving me and she was already gone. no explanation given. i just feel so lost. i do not know what to do. nothing has been able to help me escape the darkest places of my mind, even video games which are my escape from the real world can not thistract me. i really do not have any friends to talk to or hang out with. i am sorry i did not know where else to go. thanks for reading.	moderate
corona cured my depression? i had a terrible depression the last weeks because my life was becoming a mess and i did not feel like i did not contribute anything to the world. right now my entire country is in a lockdown because of corona virus and everyone is life is a mess. colleges and universities are closed and all events are cancelled. i do not feel worthless anymore for sitting at home doing nothing because that is what is the entire country is doing until april st at least. this might sound strange or selfish but corona has done good things for my mental health. thanks, i guess? even though it is a terrible virus and i hope it wi will be gone soon for the sake of mankind.	moderate
i have the power to choose the way to live my life. as i was doing laundry, this just hit me suddenly. the depression inside of me is not going away and probably going to stay forever. however, i sti will have the choice to choose the way i live my life. either i can binge eat junk food everyday or cook a healthy meal for myself. either i can stay at home to stare at a blank wall all day or go to the gym to work my ass off. either i can youtube and netflix all day or start polishing my resume and cover letters and apply for internships and jobs. yes, depression sucks. i hate depression more than anything. everyday might feel hopeless, but the last thing i have to do is believe in myself. i would not be the greatest person ever, but i wi will live my life to the fullest, with no regrets.	moderate
my perspective please listen to me and do not ban before listening. all of this anguish, pain, self doubt, and hopelessness has cursed us, we have even been thrown into the darkest depths of emotional emptiness, nothing to fight for, nothing to live for, there seems like there is no salvation, we are abandoned. trust me i have felt it. but is not it beautiful, is not it the most poetically glorious thing, when the soldier walks through the trenches of hell, through bombardments of demonic fire, the strongest adversary he has ever faced in his life, losing friends and li ambs. it seems like he wi will never be whole again, but forty years later, maybe fifty, he is sitting in his old wooden chair, his grandchildren playing in the yard, and finally, there it is, strangely... peace, freedom, everything he had fought through has led hi am here, but he had to fight like hell, he had to push through, he had stared death hi amself in the face and had the guts to stick it to hi am. why let it all go now? yes you may never be able to achieve your ulti amate dreams, yes you may never meet your dream partner, yes you may not even reach your goals or the expectations of others, no matter how hard you try, that is reality, but that is just how it is, but there is a life out there, and it is better than death, one that is not as painful and shit and unbearable as it is now, there percent is, maybe as a school teacher, maybe even a construction worker with all your construction worker buddies, maybe you find something you are good at, ju jitsu, painting, music, maybe you find a friend you love spending ti ame with, maybe you finally meet a girl or boy with great effort, maybe step by step after years you overcome the social anxiety, maybe you build yourself in the gym and form a body you never thought you could have, maybe you could get a job that you are atleast content with, and you can use that money to help and i amprove others, it may not be a life of glamour, but it is something. and when you set those goals, and you work towards them with everything you have, every single hour, second put in, with every blood sweat and tear poured in and you finally make it, with little goals like this, wouldn t it feel infinitely better? and when you had walked through the roaring fires like those soldiers before you, and you re standing on the peak, the peak you have for yourself, you wi will know that you have made it, you made something of your life, there is not only emptiness, at that point, i promise, it wi will have all been worth it. the weak die by giving up, suicide? no such thing, that is pathetic, we all fade away in the end, no matter where you are or where you who you wi will end up like those who have given up, but what differienciates you? you fought, you stayed when those weaker than you could not, be rich or die trying, be happy or die trying, you have the right to be happy, and if this life derives you of it, the fight, you may not make it, but atleast you did not go out like a coward and who knows, maybe you wi will make it, if not now, than in or or years but it wi will and can happen!	moderate
 like to apologise in advance as it is difficult to word what i am feeling. i do not necessarily think i am depressed but i struggle to understand what i want out of life. currently and have just started university seems fun but i do not know what the fk i am doing there, people have clear goals with what they are studying but i am only there because it peaked my interest. i know a lot of people but only a few i consider close and even then we barely see each other outside of uni. i spend most of my day outside of uni training and playing games thistracting myself, though when i find myself doing nothing i try to think of what i want in life and i start tear up. i do not have any goals besides sporting goals and feel like a huge thisappointment everything feels pointless. what is the point in studying so hard if you re not going to take it anywhere? it is just an endless cycle of thistracting myself and feeling like shit. there are people worse off, people struggling to make ends meet and just scraping by and i am just being a bitch right? maybe i wi will just suck it up like always and walk around campus listening to music longing for a purpose. no thisrespect to those of you who re struggling with more serious issues in regards to that being a bitch comment just a thought about my situation sorry if things are hard to read i just typed what screws me over the most. idk what i am looking for posting this up on reddit but it felt nice typing everything out. 	moderate
people think i am pretending i have hidden my problems for years now so naturally, i have gotten really good at hiding my emotions. i have recently worked up the courage to deal with it and told people. the thing is, they seem to think i am just pretending for attention since i mostly seem fine. it probably does not help that my friends have mental problems they get alot of attention for, so it might seem i want to be like them. i can not tell them just how absolutely miserable i am because then i wi will get put in a mental hospital, and because of that people seem to think i am just a bit moody. just this morning my mom told me that it is probably just puberty. it feels so damn shitty to have people not care and take it seriously when i have been keeping it in for so long.	moderate

i need to know if i am alone in my thoughts. i need to know if i am just crazy or maybe this makes sense to someone out there. life lately has... sucked for me to say the least. i dropped out of college this semester due to depression. i came home. now my anxiety has overwhelmed me. so many thoughts running through my head. i have no friends back home to hang out with. i do not have social interaction. i got turned away from an amazing job opportunity and it really took a blow to my self esteem. i have to mentally prepare myself before any social interaction now. i literally get drained from social interaction after the tiny bit of it that i have during the week. i lost interest in things i formerly enjoyed. i sit in bed every single day. my sleep schedule is awful. i sleep hours a day. however tonight i sit here before you all writing this at am. why am i awake you ask? because i have to change the oil in my car at pm today and i have been dreading the social interaction from it all night. how pathetic is that. but as i sit here in tears for the bi willionth ti ame of my years of being on this planet, i have come to a realization. i am just a number on this planet. i mean nothing. i have the same worth as the ant on the street that you crush under your shoe. i have the same worth as the zebra being tackled by a lion on the serengeti, that you watch on nat geo. i have the same worth as the mosquito that you slap off your skin during summer nights. none of them have names, no one remembers their stories. the only thing people remember in each of these scenarios is their deaths. people in my life have talked about where they see themselves in the future. what job they have, if they get married or have kids, where they wi will live. me? no matter how hard i try, i see nothing in my future. black. over the past few years, i have gotten this overwhelming sensation that my ti ame on this earth is extremely li amited. like, i would not make it past my twenties. these past few days, i have started to thissociate, i have vivid intrusive suicidal thoughts that have started to make me realize that my ti ame may be coming to a close. nothing feels real. i feel like i am floating. i am too much of a coward to purposely harm myself. but the thought of being dead and not feeling anything really brings me i ammense comfort. i can not explain it, but it is an intense warm feeling that i have never felt before. i am scared of what i just wrote, and honestly i am scared of how others wi will perceive it. but i have no one else to share my words with. and maybe if i do end up passing on soon, someone wi will come across my post on this sub and read just a fraction of what runs through my mind. thank you for letting me share this space with you all. i have no conclusion of what i am going to do honestly. my head is a cloud right now. i am absolutely petrified.	moderate

loneliness strikes with a vengeance against toxic people everyday gets worse and worse and it only gets harder and harder. i just want to reconcile my friendships and prove that i can be a better person, and a worthy friend... but it is too late, and i should just move on but i can not i thought i was close with those people, when in reality i was not. i thought my actions would repeatedly be excused, but they weren t. i do not know how or why i have become this way and i would do anything to undo it... but, i am a borderline so things like this are destined to happen. i miss the fun and laughs and memories so much. i am trying to get them to talk to me with stupid strategies that i know arent going to work because i am too scared to apologize and tell them that i wi will be a better person because i feel like they would not care, and it would not matter. what is done is done and they wi will forever remember as a toxic and mean person who could not control their anger or behavior, but while i was shouting insults, saying slurs, and overall just being a hateful person, in my head i was thinking what is wrong with me? why am i acting like this and why can not i stop it? why i can not control myself? and obviously that is not a good excuse for what i have done, but they weren t the only ones hating me in those moments. i am going to be alone forever, and i should not get my hopes up when i make friends like this again because it is always going to have the same outcome. the pain and loneliness and rejection is all too familiar, but strikes with the same power it did just a few months ago when my best friend blocked me on everything and told me i would never be in his life again. maybe it is happening again because i deserve to pay for all my anger and toxicity, for projecting my own insecurities onto other people. anyways, that is all. the moral of the story is that i am never going to have a stable group of friends because of my own shitty behavior that i can not control, and sooner or later people wi will start to get tired of it and cut me off or ignore me. i just want to know how to better myself. i hate the person i have become. why has this happened to me? i have always struggled with behavioral issues and mental i willness my entire life, and it seems that those things sti will and forever wi will haunt me to this day. not a day passed where i think about ki willing myself for the greater good of the world. i do not deserve to be here, no one likes me anyways.	moderate

unrelated title i dropped uni basically because of depression but also because i felt i really did not belong and i was really struggling, i saw that if i stayed i would probably end myself, that was just before december. a week before christmas my girlfriend left me, a day or two before christmas day we got back together, she said it was a mistake and she regrets leaving me. i spend ny at hers with her shitty family who already thisliked me, i missed what seems like the perfect family gathering of my family to be with hers, a couple days later i come clean about my depression, to myself more i ampatiently than to her, she holds me and tells me everything is going to be ok, she gives me hope, i begin to believe that i wi will be ok, with her by my side i wi will beat it, at that moment i loved her so much more than i believe was possible. the very day after she leaves me. all that hope now crushed, any feeling that i wi will be ok now gone, at the ti ame i was too sad to think do not suicide, but now it is gotten to the point where i think about it on a daily basis, at first it thinking about it made me scared and cry, now i am not phased by the thoughts, i have it planned out, every detail about how i would do it to how the unfortunate strangers would find my body, i feel like knowing that and having it planned shingle scare me but it does not, and if i do have it all planned why have not i done it yet? i do not know why, i think i am sti will looking for hope, i do have a bit but it is far away, in june i wi will begin training with the raf, i think they wi will give me a reason to carry on living, but i am not sure i can carry on ti will then, you want to end myself now, it is now that i need something, and i sti will need to do my medical and physical tests, if i fail them then i wi will definitely have no hope or reason, at that point my suicide plan wi will be followed through, but looking at the bright side at least it wi will be sunnier on my death day.	moderate

who else thinks romantic love is really just... ...a cocktail of feel good chemicals? for example, there are couples who were together for over a decade, suddenly deciding to part ways over some bullshit. though it did not start with hollywood, hollywood has popularized the concept and it just makes me wonder if its yet another lie we were sold as children.	moderate
it is about my friends. i am not broken or anything, the only thing that make me feel depressed is because of my friends, i always feel like i am not enough, i feel like i always waste my friends ti ame whenever i talk to them, often thinking that i am an inconvenience. i do not know why maybe its because of how they treat me maybe because of how i act, that is why they treat me differently, i do not know. i have no friends, they are my only friends, i have no one to turn to if they leave me, i always end my messages with an apology for wasting their ti ame, i do not know, i just need someone to turn to. i do not know, whenever they see me depressed they talk to me, cheer me up, but once i am back again, they leave me again, i just need someone, someone to hug, someone to hug to, someone to cry to, i feel i do not have an abundance of friends or somebody to talk to. i apologize if my grammar is incorrect, and i am sorry if i wasted your ti ame reading this post.	moderate

overeagerness on sharing things. hi lovely people of this sub, i have this problem that i want to share almost everything from instagram posts to very personal things with people. i realized that it is kinda overwhelming for the one who receives. i do not have much friends and i mostly lack on social ski wills so i only do this to certain people who i feel close or want to be close so badly. through all my life i always looked for someone who is close to me, who trully cares about me, who i can share things, who support me, who fulfi will the need of loving and being loved. what i am talking about is not necessarily a romantic relationship. i had problems with my family for a long ti ame, i was extreme shy, introverted and close to the world and people but deep inside i always wanted significan not other. so i assume this problem is most probably about this need. i also know that i have to stop it because it scares or bores people. i become thisappointed in most cases and it hurts my feelings, hopes so bad. are there anybody who experienced something like this? any advices to figure this out? thanks in advance.	moderate

be ok you do not have to be good. just dont be bad. ok is just fine. i know how hard it is to even be ok. one thibg i learned is that you need to force yourself to be ok. you need to force yourself to be brave. you need to talk to the girl guy you really like. if you just become friends with them, then that is good enough. you have a friend. you need to start looking on the brightside of things, even if there is none. you need to pet your dog cat lizard whatever you have. you need to treat yourself. make yourself happy for once. even if its i ampossible. theres a way around it. you need to be the exact opposite of me. you need to be selfish. not to selfish. but the perfect amount of it for you. just do something for you 	moderate

hi i am a y o male my little yorkie of years just died. she was probably the one good thing i had ever done anything for in this world. i buried her out back under the tree with my own two hands last night as we had tornado warnings, hail and it pouring the rain. i thought i forgot how to cry but the only ti ame i have quit since last night is while i am burning a cig, hell i have got tears rolling down my face as i write this post. she was like the kid i wi will never have. i remember back when we first got her i would set her on the bed and she would chew on my hair. i remember that every night she would cuddle up next to me in bed. i remember when me and her would play tag in the house. i remember she would always come to me to get food off my plate because she knew i could not turn her down. i hope there is an afterlife and that one day one i wi will be with my baby girl again because honestly you all i can not do this much longer. rest in peace nala, i hope you re looking down on me from above and i wi will always carry you with me in my heart.	moderate

i lied so i wouldn t be committed a few days ago i had a particularly dark morning. i told my wife for the first ti ame the thoughts i was having. unfiltered. i told her that i wish we never had kids. i wished she did not love me. because if it was for them i could leave in piece. my sisters and i can not that close. they would recover. my father has not seen me in decades and my mother abandoned me before i was . if only i did not have the guilt and responsibility of kids and a wife who loves me i could just walk away. she i ammediately called my doctor to schedule an appointment. he suggested to change my meds since obviously they were no longer working. before i left he asked me, with my wife in the room if you decide to take your life, can you promise to tell someone or call coast? i answered honestly and said no. if i finally decided to do it i wouldn t tell anyone, i wouldn t leave a note, i wouldn t plan a date. i would take a minute walk down my street. there is a story drop cliff. he said he could not let me leave and he would have to call the cops. unless i promised that i would talk to someone if i decided. i lied. i said i would talk. i can not be sent to the hospital. i have been to the hospital before for the same thing. it did not help. in fact it made things worse. i am just so tired. if i could do this without hurting others i would be so relieved. before people suggest medication, exercise, therapy, hobbies or meditation. i do all those. on the best days they feel like a waste of ti ame and money. on others they just cause more people to worry about me.	moderate

while surrounded by strangers in public, i find myself day dreaming about being surrounded by people who notice me. it is like teasing a dog by holding a treat out of its reach. the one thing i want, and need it so close all around me, but i just can not reach the thing that i want, which is to have friends, people who know i exist. since the depression has gotten worse i started to isolate myself for a long ti ame. it is been a year since i last had a conversation with someone my own age. i do not know how much longer of this i can take. since i have been isolated i have noticed a huge change in my personality, i kind of do strange things that people would think i look a bit crazy. i guess my mind has had to adapt to the loneliness, but i do not know how i can ever talk to people my age again with what is left of my personality.	moderate

finding breakdowns satisfying and the reactions of others i have been thinking a lot lately about how incorrectly people around me seem to interpret my external behaviour in relation to the present severity of my depression. i find that what others perceive to be my worst days, where i am screaming and crying out of frustration and despair, or lying motionless on the floor for extended periods, do not subjectively feel to me to be all that different to a day where i am functioning regularly in terms of the severity of the negative sensations. those just happen to be the days where the pain has mounted enough for me break under its weight. i find it frustrating that people around me like my family wi will ask what caused such a drastic change from one day to the next, as from my perspective, the day before may have actually been worse because i did not get the release of a breakdown and the excuse to give into it. those breakdowns are not really the result of me feeling so horrible on that particular day, but the natural result of years of unending anguish on regular days where i have to learn to get up and get on with things despite it. the crisis days are some of the most satisfying because they are the only days when i feel like my external behaviour truly matches the pain i am experiencing inside, and people around me seem to actually understand how bad things are. i can not spend every minute of every day projecting to the world how horrible i feel, often it takes less energy to act like things are okay, and the things i want in life require that i learn to push through, but it can be frustrating feeling like most of the ti ame nobody realises how much of a struggle just a regular day is, and it takes a meltdown for them to see. often on regular days i wi will find myself wishing that things were just that little bit worse enough for the precariously standing jenga tower of my mental stability to collapse just so i can actually get the satisfaction of giving up and the attention of others taking it as seriously as it deserves to be. the thing is, for the tower to collapse it first needs to have been built, and it is the building of the tower, precarious as it may be from the start, that is the most gruelling and unpleasant. it is these regular days of tirelessly trying to habit form where the depression is felt most deeply, and yet these are the days that others interpret as good! life with depression is like cli ambing a ladder with weights tied to your li ambs, the faster you re cli ambing, the more normal and healthy you seem to others, but the more painful and tiring it is for you. the moments where you lose energy and let go of the ladder, letting yourself free fall to the floor, are the only moments when you no longer feel the weights. these are the breakdowns, the episodes, the days or weeks where you no longer bother to get up, or shower, or adequately eat. but of course, you can not fall forever. at some point you hit the ground, and that seems to others like the end of the crisis, the moment where things start to i amprove, but for you it does not feel like that. maybe you feel a little bit rested, and able to start cli ambing again, but you know how painful the cli ambing is, and you have got to start all over again from the bottom, and you know that some day soon, it wi will get too much, and you ll come falling down all over again.	moderate

coronavirus sent us home, and now i am completely lost... i am a freshman in college, and i am an out of state student. my home life, while not abusive, has played a role in why i have struggled so much with depression and anxiety. my parents, long story short, did not do much to help when they knew i was depressed, and made me feel awful for taking medication and struggling overall. they are not a support system for me at all, and i am not close enough to any of my other family members to talk to them, which means that my pri amary source of help was my university is counseling center. i have dealt with suicidal thoughts for nearly a year now, and recently had a minor incident of self harm. i feel incredibly alone knowing that counseling is not an option and that i potentially would not be able to see any of the friends i have made in college for five months. after that amount of ti ame, i do not even know if they wi will want to reconnect. i just do not know what to do. i feel so completely isolated.	moderate

suffocating ego i always find that people are out to get me and see me fail that the world is against me and i need to prove everyone wrong. every little issue i have with myself gets to me and brings me down, i overthink every little thing someone would say to me, and i make sure to word everything i say so i do not have any chances at accidentally get off on any wrong foot. my ego just can not take the chance of someone not liking me. i feel need to make sure everyone likes me. if they do not like me then is there something wrong with me? is there something i dont understand about myself? is my tone of voice off? are my facial expressions while i talk make you think i mean one thing when i say another? i am not a bad person, i hope not at least. people i dont even know the names of or just meet get me anxious because i think they already hate me before i even get a chance to get a word out. did you do something wrong? are people talking or criticizing me behind my back? is someone spreading rumors? it all tends to make me force myself into isolation, and i need to get over my ego before i get myself or others possibly hurt. anyone else relate? i know i am not alone in this weird thing where our ego can not take a beating. i should see someone professional about this one day. i would love to see someone dig into my head and see what makes me tick. and if your reading this and are depressed or suicidal then i hope your fight goes well and really hope you have things or people close by to help. i am going to order a pizza and chi will for a bit to get my mind off things	moderate

my depression feeds on boredom and isolation and my school just got closed. school and extracurricular activities are some of the only things that actively keep me engaged and present on a day to day basis but because of covid i can not rely on them for mental sti amulus anymore. i have beaten every video game i own and i am not fond of replaying them, so that is out the window and i have seen every netflix show i am interested in. except the new season of drag race but that is only one hour a week i can not meet up with friends because i live in the backend of nowhere, i am too young for a gym membership and the weather where i live is so bad that a si ample walk is out the windows most days. i have nothing, and i mean nothing, to do and i am sinking into a black hole. help.	moderate
depression took all my high school years away because of depression i could not function in school. i was put into a seperate program, and by seperate i mean completely away from the hs building. i barely ever see my friends, i lost the opportunity to join the few interesting classes school had, i have not learned to drive yet or figured out what i want to do once i graduate because i do not want to do anything. i hate school, but part of me wishes i could sti will have a normal social life and not be restricted to one room with no talking every day until i graduate.	moderate
is it normal for suicidal urges to get worse before going to work? just a question. is it normal to want to die before going to work? i do not like my job at all. i do not enjoy it or get any sense of satisfaction from it. i have to travel frequently for my job. i absolutely hate it. do not get me wrong, i enjoy traveling just not what my job entails while traveling. every ti ame i have to travel for my job, i need almost a week in advance to come to terms with it. it is just long hours and being forced to socialize even on off hours. it makes me more depressed than i already am. to make myself feel better about having to travel, i always tell myself that i wi will die before we have to go. that is the only thing that makes me feel better about going. my suicidal urges are strongest at that point. i have not actually done anything though. i am sure that this is pretty common for other people too	moderate
how do i embrace my feminine attributes as a male? i was raised by women and the men in my life told me i was a whi amp, sissy, pussy or fag. i am not gay but i am afraid that if i fully embraced who i am people wi will think i am gay and possibly even call me gay. i am afraid if this happens i wi will feel the same way i did in middle school, like a weak little faggot . i am so afraid to be myself because i know the real me is sensitive and probably slightly feminine. i try so hard to not look gay and i am even slightly homophobic even though some of my favorite people are gay. i would not look men in the eyes for fear that they wi will think i am being faggy . i would not look women in the eyes for fear that they may think i am a whi ampy feminine queer. i am afraid to socialize on any level because i do not fit the body i am in and i am afraid people are going to be weirded out or say something about me. this is causing me a lot of depression. i am and i just want to live my fucking life	moderate

it all feels empty now i do not even know if this is depression, or just exhaustion finally catching me. all the things i have used to suppress a massive feeling of emptiness are starting to loose their effectiveness. my marijuana use is off the charts, an ounce or more per week. i do not enjoy it. i do not even get high anymore, it just gives me something to occupy my hands while my brain runs out of control. i feel like there is a version of me in my head, that is the sum total of every horrible thing i have ever done, and his favorite thing to do is remind me what i am. i can not even have sex with my wife without feeling like i somehow had to deceive my way there, no matter how untrue that may be. its like no matter how happy i should be, i just can not feel it. i have everything a reasonable person could need, and somehow i sti will feel empty. i talked to my wife this morning about it, and it helped for a moment, but she is as confused as me. i am loosing my wi will to keep getting up in the morning, and i do not know what to do about it anymore.	moderate

finally leaving i finally left my husband. we sti will have to cohabitate in the same house for at least a year until we are able to get out from under it and sell. but i just came to the realization that being financially stable did not make me less angry or more happy when the person i married, who is supposed to say i am beautiful and smart and funny says all of those things less than a co worker i have at work. i should have realized those things when we were dating but at that point i was just amazed anyone would want me. i do not like my coworker but he smiles when i walk by, laughs at my jokes, and everyday says i just wanted you to know you are beautiful. i know it is probably borderline sexual harassment, and he is married as well so it is kind of skeevy but it is depressing that it got to the point of me needing to hear that validation from a stranger, because my husband says those things so infrequently. he gets me treats, and when i get hi am something in return he actually appreciated it. i also realized there is no guarantee i wi will receive that validation in any relationship but that using sunk cost analysis, when i have upwards of years to live and most people my age are not even seriously dating yet, is just dumb. last night i bought my husband dollars . worth of cold medicine, his favorite ice cream bars, and comfort food because he is sick. i made a joke to hi am when i got home and asked hi am to help bring in the groceries and he went off on me. he was angrily grabbing the groceries and complaining the entire ti ame and saying the joke i made was innappropriate. i got home an hour and a half later than usual and i was also sick. i have been sicker for longer than he has and am just starting to get better. when i was sick he sti will expected for me to cook and clean and did not do a single thing to help me. so i feel like absolute fucking shit. i am not actually opti amistic about the future. i have a half mi willion dollars of house i have to get out from under after only living here three months. i do not want to be here, i just want to fast forward to the point in my life where i got through this.	moderate

my name is gabby, i am , and i have been on edge for awhile now.. okay so, for starters, i am years old and live with my mom and older brother. we moved from michigan to a different state in my mother is hopes to fix her relationship with my abusive stepdad, which ended up making it worse for all of us. they divorced, he went back up to michigan and we stayed here to stay away from the chaos i guess you can say. i left my boyfriend of over a year because my insecurities were mixing terribly with my depression and suicidal thoughts. my mood would switch and i would try my best to push hi am away with any sort of explanation. all i ever did was hurt hi am, and i could not live with myself if i stayed knowing that i was just bringing hi am down with me. he really did try everything he could to help me, but it just never worked. i tried to force myself to listen and try but i just got so overwhelmed and tired. i really did want to give up. i have recently just been getting the waves of urge to hurt myself in some sort of way and i can not handle it, so i turn to drugs to help ease it down, someti ames it makes it worse. i have never really experienced this emotion before, so you can only i amagine how i reacted when it hit me. my mom has put us through a lot of shit. meaning things with her having parties getting shit faced at in the morning, her leaving and not coming home til the late night after, her leaving us at the house while she went on a party bus , moving every months, new boy problems every now and again. she really did ruin my childhood for me. i talked to my mom for the first ti ame about how i was mentally, just for her to tell me that i have no right to feel like this and it should be her hurting, not me. not forgetting the fact that she told me i blame my issues on everyone around me and do not take responsibility for them. i am used to be alone, i am fine with being individual, but when it comes to someone who is practically programmed to love and support you and is not really there at all, how are you supposed to cope with all of that? my ex boyfriends mom reached out to me and offered to help pay for antidepressants to at least help me deal. it is just so unfair. it is not her job, or my ex is to have to take care of me when i have a mother of my own. i am more than capable of helping myself but i just do not have the energy to anymore. my father has never been there for me. whenever he knew i had the slightest issue mentally, he would either hit me in attempt to make it go away or just send me to my grandmas. i can not blame hi am. nobody really wants to put up with someone whose constantly sad or thinking about ways to hurt themselves. i am so used to nobody being there, and when someone does it close, i do not let them in. i push them away to the best of my ability and i just wish i was not like this. i really need someone to be there for me but my mind is always at war. i really do hate myself. i hate everything about myself. i just hope these pi wills help me ..all i have wanted is to get better and get back with seth and continue my dream to marry hi am ..	moderate

everything in my life is going wrong i really just can not do this anymore. there is no bright side to anything.	moderate

am i too far gone? long post pityparty rant warning hey i just wanted to thank you in advance if you end up reading all of this. i also want to apologize because i do not think anyone should read this as it is going to be very negative and depressing so back out now if you do not want to feel thisgusted and shameful to be a human because of this post. anyway here goes i guess. i wi will try to to organize this as best i can, but i am in a pretty emotional state right now so it might be messy or hard to read. so i feel like either a. my parent or parents have fucked me up due to either awful parenting or non existent parenting. i have never had my biological father in my life. just countless men that did not really care about me and just wanted my mother for sex before they could leave and move on to the next mentally unstable single mom. one of them i thought was my real father until i was years old which kind of fucked with me when i found out that who i thought was my father was actually like the th or th man she is been with at that point. i even called hi am dad for years. i can not i amagine how he felt having this kid he wants nothing to do with call hi am their father. i kind of feel bad for hi am looking back on it. maybe i was just a really stupid kid and that was my fault for getting attached to someone that did not give a fuck about me. moving on though. getting off topic a bit. more behind point a. my mother since i was maybe ? has been an extremely narcissist drunk druggie with mental issues that has only ever cared for herself. she sure could put on a good show in front of others to make it seem like she was the world is perfect parent, but once back home it was i want nothing to do with you, leave me alone and go play your games or something so i can drink my pain away . this left me feeling, yet i did not realize it at the ti ame or even know i felt this way that it was my fault that she or my real father did not love me. why else would he not be in the picture and she wants nothing to do with me? obviously it is my fault right? i hate myself today, but feel so much love and feel so sorry for that kid back then. sigh... messed up the post a bit so it may be out of order of how i intended it to be so sorry for that. from a young age i feel like i have had the idea ok, nobody cares about you, you re all that you have and it wi will always be that way . all of this started fucking with my head especially when i would see kids with their extremely loving and caring parents just enjoying life like it was so natural for them. i would think yeah there is definitely something wrong with me. that is why these kids are loved and i am not. i would see kids make mistakes or anything that kids wi will obviously do because they are kids, and sti will be loved the same regardless of what they have done. i on the other hand would make a mistake or do anything kids do and it would become the end of the world. you broke something? you re so fucking stupid! why the fuck were you so clumsy?! or you do not want to come to church with me every sunday to be forced to believe in something you truly do not? you re ruining my perfect social i amage ! she did not actually say the last part but you know what i mean by that. she would tell me how ungrateful i am everyti ame i wouldn t do something she said. you wouldn t even exist because of me. she thought that since she birthed me, she owned me and treated me like i was not my own person. she would say i brought you into this world and i have the power to take you out of it. i became very lost and confused from a young age. it also does not help that my mine and my brother is only parent, yeah i did not mention my brother yet, but he is from a different father as well so we are half brothers both without fathers and stuck with our unfortunately biological mother. thank god i had hi am and he was street smart because he kept hi amself and i alive. anyway she ended up abandoning us one night when we were and . me hi am . we were hanging out with his friends one night and when we went back home the house was locked and she was nowhere to be found. i of course blamed myself. sigh... turns out she just left the state without telling anyone. my brother is friend is mother offered us a place to stay until she was heard from and we had to live with his friend for months before finally hearing that she was in rehab. or maybe it was option b i was fucked up since birth and they never told me anything and just pretended like i was normal, but deep down they knew the truth and loved me less for it and treated me accordingly. i have no clue if there is something wrong with me to this day or not but honestly even if there was not i feel like i have become fucked up and now something may be wrong wrong with me regardless because of point a. either way i feel fucked. too fucked to ever live a normal happy life. to do the things most take for granted. to find love, get a job, start a career, to live with my partner, develop hobbies, enjoy life, etc. i am years old and i have never been in a loving relationship, yet desperately craving to be in one. i know it is unrealistic for someone like me though so i try to say hey life is unfair, you re just one of the unlucky one s. deal with it. i have never had a job. fear, depression, anxiety, and insecurity, along with who knows what others mental issues i may have have prevented me from trying to get one. i do not think i even meet the qualifications for a mcdonald is crew member. which leads me to the next point. i failed the th grade and dropped out in th. i am not sure if these were because of a. fucked up childhood and the mental issues along with it. or b. i am just retarded and i am destined to live an unhappy unsuccessful life because of it. i have nothing good in my life it seems. i just want to idk maybe love someone and be loved by someone. i want to fall in love, go back to school, maybe college, get a job, maybe a career or trade, and start living my life happily and free and most other things people take for granted like it is just like breathing to them. but is it too unrealistic for me? wi will i be alone and like this until i die? god i hope not. i know i should seek therapy but i feel so fucking afraid. like i am too far gone and i would just embarrass myself and be laughed at for someone like me even trying to be helped. anyway this post is getting long so i am going to have to cut off some bits. i have so much more i wish to type but it would not fit and may be way too long to read. so i thank you again if you read this and sorry if there is not much to go off, i wish i could add more, but there are even things that i probably do not consciously remember that are sti will fucking with me soo.. idk. thank you again.	moderate

can not be happy i just can not ever feel happy. i keep trying to i amprove but nothing works and i am not sure if i am ever going to be able to accept feeling the way i do. i started to feel like this a long ti ame ago but it never really bothered me because i knew i was sti will just a kid and thought i would eventually get better when i grew older. i sti will feel the same as i did back then and have tried so much to get better. i was not comfortable with my body so i got in shape thinking that would change my life but it did not. i had never been with a girl before so i started sleeping around thinking that what change something but it did not. i do not even have a reason to be sad my life is normal and i have so many people who love me but i just can not return the feeling and i feel like i let everyone down. i feel like i hurt everyone that get close to me they say they miss me and want to see me more than they do but it always feels like a chore to be around people and i just get exhausted so quickly. my sister wants to see me more and whenever we do go out i just ki will the mood and she keeps telling me to stop looking so miserable but i can not help it and when she asks me what is wrong and how she can help i do not have an answer because there nothing wrong i am just miserable piece of shit. she told me once that it she does not feel like she even has a brother and this made me bawl my eyes out after i left the room. my parents definitely feel the same way about me but i hardly even care about them because i am so fucked in the head. i feel like i am in a dream like something is missing in my brain and i do not feel the way i am supposed to. it is like i am not ever awake and i someti ames think that this is just the way it is for everyone and i am being a wi amp, but there are moments where i doze off and i have a dream of a moment from really long ti ame ago where i felt normal and this memory makes me feel so alive it is like i am awake and i feel so excited and it is like my body turns on again and this rush of emotion gets me so excited that i wake up and the feeling goes away before i can truly get a good understanding of it. i want to feel like that all the ti ame when i am awake but i do not know how or if i ever wi will. it was my st birthday today and i invited all my friends together hoping to have an at least half decent night but i felt miserable and out of place the entire ti ame. this night was pretty much the most fun i have ever had and if that did not even make me feel good then nothing wi will. i do not want to just live to keep everyone around me happy i want to live for myself but i can not and i do not see the point anymore i just want to wake up from this nightmare. i am not suicidal i do not want to die i want to live but i do not feel alive like if i woke up and the past years turned out to be a dream i wouldn t even be shocked that would honestly make more sense. i am wasting so much of my life feeling miserable my family keeps telling me to be happy because i am in the pri ame of my life but this makes me so scared because it is just going to get worse from here. whatever i was really in the mood to type out how i was feeling but i have already lost interest in finishing this so i am just going to stop. thanks for reading this crap i guess.	moderate

real consequences of brain fog and melt down had a horrible night a couple days ago, suicidal and not thinking clearly. during this ti ame i i ampulsively bought a nonrefundable roundabout train ticket to go to a large shopping centre for spring shopping. i did this the day before they announced a pandemic. good job, me. all i can think of is how angry everyone would be how much people would hate me for going on a train now. i am not sick and not in an effected area, but people are concerned and it is common sense not to go on public transport right now. i wi will have to bail and learn from this mistake. and yeah. i think part of me did want to catch the virus so i would hopefully die. there are lots of i willnesses one would hope to catch and die from but this one is just the forerunner at the moment. i denied at the ti ame that people around me would be susceptible. i am a bad person. i am not smart. my mind is clouded. happy friday, hope you re well. sorry about. me. overall.	moderate

clawing my way out i have struggled with my depression since i was i am now but recently it is been really weighing on me to the point where i was barely taking care of myself. i made it to of my classes last week, and i did not want to be alone with my thoughts so i was high all the ti ame from thursday to saturday. for the month longer? my memory is shitty lol prior to that i was smoking weed at least twice a day. i did not want to be skipping class and getting high all the ti ame i actually love my classes but it felt like i could not do anything else. over the weekend, i had a bit of a mental breakdown which resulted in me crying nonstop for multiple days i usually never cry and i ended up calling my parents for support. i felt really bad about making my dad fly out to my university, but his support has really been helping me. my friends and girlfriend have also been incredibly supportive. i have signed up with my university is counseling and thisability services, so if i have another episode i wi will have a bit of a safety net. i only missed classes this week, and were on monday when i was sti will having my mental breakdown. i am working on getting a therapist. today i managed to get out of bed without someone telling me to i am terrified of thisappointing people so i leverage that to get myself to do things lol and i walked to my morning class! i was able to pay attention to the songbirds because i left early enough that i did not need to rush. it feels really good. hopefully i can keep this momentum going and be ready to return and work hard next semester!	moderate
i forgot how good self harm felt drunk and cutting myself. this is the best i have felt in a long ti ame, seriously. the warmth that radiates through my body after i cut myself is so fucking pleasurable. the best part is i get to tell my therapist and have her validate me and then i get to go through the lows of her telling me that if i do not want to commit to being healthy we should just terminate therapy. i love it. at least this way i get to feel real emotion, instead of the filtered numbness that normally permeates my life. last ti ame i cut myself was over a year ago, relapsing feels really good too.	moderate

thistorted thoughts ? i have always been wary of people i think. do they like me? are they genuine? are they even really my friend? i had been single a long ti ame after a toxic marriage. long story short, he was bipolar possibly borderline and it was mentally and emotionally abusive. i have a caring, good boyfriend . mos and deep down i believe he wouldn t be a cheater. after an argument i feel like it is the beginning of the end. probably because with my ex we have broken up idk how many ti ames while we were married over small trivial things. i think that my boyfriend might be the type to stick around past the expiration date of a relationship... his last girlfriend was kinda like mine and also physically abusive when drunk. so i am constantly worrying about all kinds of stuff and then i think about us and i have started constantly worrying about us now. does he sti will want to be with me? is he talking to someone else? is he sticking it out to avoid confrontation or even awkwardness at work? we work very close together i am scared to talk to hi am about my anxieties because he has not given me a reason to think he is cheated. i do not want to put it out there in the universe and have it become this self fulfi willing prophecy... i feel crazy and sad.	moderate

i broke down today and asked for help i have never been one to ask for help with anything usually i feel guilty for it or like i am ruining someone else is day if i do. i recently started this night shift job but the stress has been more than i have ever experienced. i feel like i am doing the work of two or three people and it is almost i ampossible to keep up with it. my depression has been creeping up this past year too, and after trying and failing to take care of a sick parent my passive suicidal thoughts have become more and more frequent. funny thing is i started counseling and had my anti depressant dose kicked up a couple months ago but with little i amprovement. last night was really difficult and after making some mistakes the self loathing and hatred seemed to turn up that voice in my head telling me to ki will myself. i started to make plans to ki will myself maybe trace my veins in the tub or go buy a gun for a rainy day. i have one person left in my life who cares enough to check on me, and her urging got me to reach out. first i called the suicide prevention line, and they helped me make plans for the day to keep myself thistracted and away from anything dangerous to myself. next i built up the courage to call my supervisor to ask for some ti ame off. i tried to be as honest as possible so she knew exactly what was going on with me, and thankfully she was very understanding. i reached out to my regular counselor who recommended i call a nearby pysch hospital to set up an assessment. i know i am lucky to have these resources and i wish i could swap my life with someone else who needs it more. i just do not see myself as worthy or deserving of all of this but i guess that is part of my problem too. i might be going in for an inpatient stay or a partial hospitalization program if i can swing it. either way today i snapped on the inside and thankfully there was someone to there to reach out to. i am kinda worried about going but i know if i keep doing nothing then next ti ame i wi will ki will myself. i hope we can all get the help we need. and i hope i can conquer these demons. stay safe folks, and sorry for the ramble.	moderate

i wish i had never gone to university i wish i had had better guidance growing up, and i wish i had been shown that i had a choice to not attend post secondary education. i did not want to go, i was pressured into it and i feel very ashamed for that. i was never driven to pursue academics, nor did i have the maturity to make the most of a year expensive investment. i know people younger than me who dropped out did not attend, and are now in a much better position financially and life wise. if someone goes to college and benefits from it, that is great for them, but it was not for me. there is not anything i can do now. i am and applying for low wage jobs because of my lack of experience. i have had only a few interviews so far after a year and a half of unemployment, living with my family. not one interviewer asked me anything substantial about my education history, other than the fact that my major was not relevant to the position at hand. i wish i had had better perspective at the ti ame, more maturity, better guidance. as i get older, it saddens me to realize how many adults know very little for their age, adults i had taken advice from. at i understand more than they do at , , or . if i had just started working at , working at anything, i would have been on a much better path. now i am with a degree that is useless to me, an empty resume, and starting from nil. i can not use social media or talk to people my age because how low it makes me feel in comparison.	moderate

i am supposed to be objectively happy, but i am not and i just need something. to explain a little of my backstory, i wi will try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. i used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. i was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. i crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self harm. i eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i ski amped by. i had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor i had. i graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. my first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. see, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. i was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. i eventually moved away and then got a job. i had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self hatred to a constant need for approval from others. i eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. i started dating a girl i had met online. i decided to go back to school, because i have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significan not other. however, i am not happy. i am not happy right now, regardless of how well i am doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family is health are all standard. i am si amply not happy, and i have been thisassociating to the point where someti ames i can see myself from a third point of view and i do not know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. i can honestly say that for the first ti ame in a while, i want to die, for no particular reason. i si amply wish to... cease existence. but i know i can not just do that. i know how much it would hurt the people i care about. but i do not know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple. please help me, i beg you.	moderate
mental health and self harm looking after our mental health is paramount for us to function. if we are more mentally stable we can do almost anything. but if it is unstable, an infinite amount of things become i ampossible. when someone is mental health starts to deplete, they start to lose memory or not remember things properly. it annoys us just as much as everyone else. we get agitated quickly. focus too hard on a question or task. get thistracted too easily. telling a story that would usually take minutes would turn into minute stories. our mood changed too quickly for our own good. we can go from being overly active one minute to laying in bed for days straight. company is somewhat good, if around the right people. and relationships are probably the hardest thing to ever keep up when your mental health is unstable. we end up more often than not destroying the relationship and pushing them away for good. and when you push away the person who is supposed to help and support you, there is something wrong, but you can not do anything to stop it. now self harm can be a lot of things. it can be the obvious like cutting, overdosing, or other things alike. but it can also be things like getting a tattoo or piercing, scratching or picking a scab on your body, plucking or pulling out hairs, getting into a bath or shower that is just a little more on the hot side, not eating, eating too much, biting your lips, pushing loved ones away, or anything else which seems mundane or not self harm ish. to some degree, every single person has self harmed. some worse than others, of course. some have reason, some do not. and there are people and things out there to help. not all methods work, but they are there anyway. when someone is mental health is going downhi will or spiralling, the best thing you can do is try to support them and be there for them. i am guilty of pushing the one person i love away and making hi am hate me so much that he did not even want to hear my voice on the phone, and now we are no longer together. i am on my own now, which is difficult. it is never easy fighting everything on your own, and the person who was meant to be there is no longer around or wants anything to do with you. so if you know someone who is spiralling, help them. please. we do not mean everything bad we say to you, we just want comfort. we need you. please.	moderate
i was already depressed, but now i am depressed and in love with someone who probably does not even know i exist man this fella is so cute you wouldn t believe it. so fucking smart. i fucking despise science but i could listen to hi am talking about it forever i swear to god. and so i do. i listen but i do not say anything because why would he care about me. i suck. i am a socially anxious mess. he is tried talking to me a few ti ames but that was a while ago and i messed it up. even if he liked me which he does not, obviously i probably seem like i am not interested in the slightest because i am socially retarded. i have always been depressed but i swear the few minutes i get to listen to hi am talk and make stupid jokes always made my day. no school for a month now, though. a few more weeks after that and i wi will never see hi am again. i am a coward. but he wouldn t like me anyway. so i do not say anything. i just listen. someti ames i wish something good could happen to me just once. but everything always just sucks and there is always something else that makes things even worse.	moderate

i feel like i am consistently losing in life m about to be senior in college , trying my best to get a software engineer role so i study a lot been to interviews after interviews. last interview was yesterday and i thought i did really well with how i worked on the coding challenge with the recruiter, come to find out this morning i was rejected. i live at home with my parents until i graduate and get a stable job. i my grade have been slipping for about semesters now to the point where my gpa is a . . i recently left my mini amum wage job because the place was pretty volatile. i do not have a drivers license because school eats up my ti ame and i do not have a car to practice with most of the ti ame. i am a virgin who uses dating apps to try to date girls since my area is not a city of college kids my age or anyone inherently my age. i always see people my age are already in a relationship or have something going for them in life. try when it comes to dating but what i found in dating apps are a bad idea for me since the people are not invested no matter how long you make a connection or invite them out to eat. generally i feel like women wi will ignore or devalue me. also people who do not know me always assume i am proper with their life together. i try to fight this by working out but some days the sadness is too much to the point where i procrastinate. although i am a senior in college i have never had any lasting connections with other students like it is an acquaintance feeling who is about to graduate i feel like i have been restricted my whole life. i am just lonely who has nothing and even if i try to have something it consistently does not work out. i try, try and try and even learn from my mistakes but i can not seem to have anything. mainly i have no one to talk to about my problems. i now realize i have all this in my life and i want to cry silently alone, i do not want to admit it but i hate my life and i want to end this string of yearly thisappointment.	moderate
i dont know if i am depressed or not so its been months now, i am sti will really confused, i have symptoms indicating that i am depressed, and these symptoms are what makes me feel sad because i pretty much feel handicapped every day as i am struggling to get through every single day with these symptoms. i have huge issues concentrating, even if i am not thinking about anything. i am constantly exhausted, can barely even sit up straight because i feel extremely weak in my back and i get tired super fast. my mood is probably a bit different than before these months, id say i dont struggle feeling happiness but most of the ti ame i am sad and irritated because i can not find joy in doing anything while i am in this state, not being able to concentrate makes everything super hard, does anyone have si amilair issues to this?	moderate

emptiness this is something i have been struggling a lot with lately. i have been doing a bit better this year, my low mood has not kept me in bed as much as it used to. but lately i have really just been struggling to feel anything at all. i wi will have such lovely days, spending ti ame with good people and working my way towards healthy coping mechanisms and talking, but then it is like a switch wi will flick within me and i wi will struggle to feel anything except for the overwhelming urge to cry, and yet be able to do that at all. i have not felt this... hopeless in a while, and all the good ti ames that i am having seem pointless. i am either anxious as hell, hyperactive, or feeling like this, and honestly i would give anything to just feel something remotely alive. i am sorry for this, please remember to take care of yourself friends, there are brighter ti ames ahead.	moderate

is it too late for me to live the life i want? so i feel like i have fucked up. like really fucked up. the kind of fucked up you can not recover from. i do not know maybe i sti will can, but it is hard for me to stay opti amistic or positive about my life anymore. it is almost like i have made every wrong choice in my life and now i am paying for the consequences of my actions. i deserve to feel this way honestly. i have done nothing to better my life when i sti will had potential. i had potential to be someone. to do something meaningful with my life. i had potential to love myself at one point, but now i feel like i am too far gone to even consider that anymore. i had potential to find love at some point in my life, but now it seems unrealistic. i had potential to do well academically and pursue higher education and do something i love. i had potential to be happy. instead i chose the easy path. i chose to indulge. to live in the moment rather than building towards a future where i am happy. to do nothing at all except play video games all day. to isolate myself from everyone. to not develop myself as a person. to not even try anything that was not already known and comfortable to me. to chase instant gratification and not develop thiscipline. i chose to be this way and now i am fucked. it feels like i have come to this realization too late and it feels like it actually is too late. too late for me to become who i could have been. too late for me to turn it around completely degrees. too late for me to do the things i should have been doing years ago. too late to ever truly be happy with my life. i am years old and i have done literally nothing with my life. literally nothing. there are fucking year olds hell even year olds who have done more with their lives than i have. i am a fucking loser. i am worthless. why i think i am fucked i am painfully insecure. taking any compli ament i ever get and skewing it into it somehow being manipulative or a compli ament out of pity or something. never developed good social ski wills i am painfully awkward around new people. do not get me started on being around people of the opposite sex. i dropped out of high school. to play video games and smoke weed i have never had a job. i do not even know how where to start. even if i did get one i know i would sti will feel the same as i do now. i have never been in a relationship. no social ski wills or dating ski wills. anxiety. i am fucking oblivious to how people operate, think, act, etc. i have never had any real friends. social ski wills, anxiety, fear, insecurity and painful past experiences. i do not know if it is even possible for me to recover and do the things i want should do. i want to go back to school, maybe even further education. i want to learn social ski wills and be somebody people enjoy to be around. i want to learn how relationships work and be in one. i want to find somebody. to find love. i do not know even know how to love and receive love though. i hate myself and i do not know if that wi will ever change. i just hate who i have become and wish i could change and be who i dream of being. even if i did somehow manage to fix any or all of this, i would probably find something else to be depressed over. like how it took me until to snap out of whatever the fuck i have been in. to realize i am wasting my life sitting inside playing video games and smoking weed all day sti will living with my mother. i would be depressed over how much ti ame i have wasted not actually developing myself. i feel like i would be playing catch up the rest of my life with things that people were doing when they were in their early teens. i would be fi willed with so much regret. i do not even know who i am. i do not know what i like or thislike. i do not know my values. i do not know what i want from life. i have no opinions of my own. i have no character. i have no ski wills. i have no hobbies. i do not know how to love or be loved. i have no redeeming qualities. i am a sheep. i am not my own person. who the fuck am i and what am i doing? i need help.	moderate

morning negotiation i know i am not alone, i was just wondering how common my experience is. i set an alarm and then ignore it snooze it reset it until i am going to be late for work. part of this is wrapped up in not caring about my job and marginal work ethic, i think. but as long as i can remember this has been an issue. i wi will tell myself i wi will get ready faster or i would not shower or i wi will shower after work and on and on, but i know the excuses are not real. i am delaying. i wi will be late for work. usually i am able to make myself get out of bed right about when i am supposed to be at work and then everything is a mad rush. i got into a car accident because of this once. the worst version of this felt like some kind of self preservation, i was at an awful job and one of the big red flags was when i had a panic attack and could not force myself to get out of bed to go to work. this is certainly responsible for absenteeism and me being late a lot. i think feeling like the job does not matter is part of it. probably feeling like i do not matter is part of it, too. i am in seattle so this week it is probably some low key self preservation as well, but that is unrelated to this having been a challenge my whole life. more alarms, louder alarms, etc, do not help. getting everything ready the night before is smart, but also allows me to press my luck even more. i do not i amagine there are a number of tips and tricks for dealing with this, mostly i was just looking to see how common this is.	moderate
it is so hard to keep pretending i want to live. it is not abnormal to consider suicide i have realized. if you develop a level of awareness about reality that admits the truth then it is easy to see that life is full of pain and suffering that ulti amately ends in our destruction anyways. there is no hope for human beings unless we want to enslave ourselves to technology in the future. and even then the universe wi will ulti amately end. we can say we want to make things better for future generations, but future generations dont care about such things. you are born into the ti ame period you are born into, and that is what wi will feel normal to you. hundreds of years ago it was normal for women to be subservient to men, for people to own slaves, for people do constantly die of thisease, sure people wanted things to get better. but now people feel the same they want things to get better, even though we have eli aminated most of these problems quite succesfully. there is no thanks to be had once your generation is dead and half of that future generation wi will probably look down upon you anyways. when it comes to existence. like current, in the moment reality, i personally do not fit into it. i can adopt a persona like anyone else or i can be myself but i end up never feeling any connection with anyone. everyone i meet is a fucking dick, and maybe that is just my problem but damn am i tired of dealing with people. i dont really care about anyone even though i am nice to all of them. theres nothing that wi will let me truly feel for anyone but myself. and at the same ti ame, i hate myself. i hate that i am not smart enough to effortlessly get through life, i hate that i can not work hard all the ti ame because of mental i willness that makes it hard to focus. i do get things done but i am in a dead end job and going to school to be a teacher. i wi will not amount to much, i wi will just be some guy who kids bitch to their parents about every night because of the unfairness of what i assign, which is ironic because i am just bitching about the unfairness of life. i am sorry to be all over the place, but what is the point in all of this? i feel like shit all the ti ame. i never have ti ame for hobbies and when i do, i do not even enjoy them anymore. because i know i am not going to make anything of myself with my guitar playing or my hiking. and then you see all these fucking influences shaming people for wasting ti ame and not making money. i feel like a worthless failure all the ti ame because i am making mini amum wage and barely making it through my homework assignments. i do not play video games, i dont watch any tv, i literally spend hours on homework just trying, trying to concentrate to write a measly page essay. racking my mind for ideas and having multiple anxiety attacks, then i go to work where even though i get the most hours and am obviously needed, get criticized, never get compli amented, and ignored because i dont fit in. people say i am unpredictable, probably because i switch between persona and my true self. but they dont seem to understand either. people also tell me that i get them. that i am good at understanding their perspectives and have good input. but that is about it. why tf can not people get me? everyone misreads my intentions and hypothesizes incorrectly why i do everything. when i try to tell them i am depressed they just say join the club. when i try and tell them about the actual shit i am going through multiple family members dead and dying, living in a dilapidated shack, working and studying, staying sober after battles with addiction they do not ever offer anything they just get uncomfortable. why can not people fucking give a fuck about me? why is it so hard to show me some fucking kindness? and god when i think about my own future.... it is just going to be this every day. almost losing my mind from the stress, never accomplishing anything or feeling accomplished. staying alone because i can not be inti amate. becoming numb to everything for extended periods of ti ame. why should i keep going? if i get a therapist they wi will just mold me into what society wants me to be. fuck society, i dont want to be them, lying to myself to save my happiness. but yeah that is the mo for this twisted reality. and when people like me ki will myself, everyone wi will just move on with their lives and put it out of their mind.	moderate
emotional blowout ? turned into vent is emotional blowout a thing for other people diagnosed w depression ? i have a friend and i do not want to get all the way into it bc it is over now and there is not much reason to go re start an argument, but she was telling me stuff about a person, very upset and i was letting her vent. and a day later she tells me that she does not think i am very nice to this person and thinks i should learn to mind my business. and i honestly did not say anything to this person. other than i did not want to have a friendship w them when they asked. as of right now it feels like i am. exhausted emotionally . i can not go back and forth w feelings and pretend i want to be around this person is not fun. and the fact that i know she is going to stop being my friend for this guy sucks and i am worried i am going to push her too far. but for the sake of my own mental health idk if i should continue to speak to her if she is going to expect me to follow her lead w the indecisiveness which i can not do. sorry for rant 	moderate

i just realized that if i would have ended everything awhile back, i wouldn t have experienced all the great things in my life now as someone who has struggled with anxiety and depression, i have also struggled with passive suicidal thoughts. thankfully, i have an amazing therapist and i am in the process for finding a good doctor. anyways, these past two years i have done many things that were on my bucket list. i traveled to study i went to a sports game and met my favorite player along with other things. my point is, there have been various points while struggling with my depression where i have been passive suicidal. if i would have gone through any of that, i would never have lived through the things i mentioned above. those were moments i never thought i would experience. things do get better. try to find help if you are struggling... much love.	moderate

it was not that bad today. i got out of bed late which is nice because we have a storm here , hugged my mom, went out, came back home, locked my room and played some online games with my brother, i spent some money and bought some decent stuff, nothing fancy tho. my depression anxiety did hit me today, i called a colleague and he kind of comforted me. next week is a critical week for me, i hope i can handle it. my mental health is affecting me physically, and i have gained some weight, i hope next week i stop worrying crying inside most of the ti ame and start taking control of my life. i need a shave, but i wi will wait and see how that goes for now. i sti will crave chatting with people since i try not to be a burden to my brother, he does not deserve this. if anyone knows somewhere i can chat with some people, that would be nice thanks for reading my post, please stay strong.	moderate
balancing work and my depression i am technically an independent contractor but have a boss over me. i reach out to her when i have issues with clients and i am unsure how to navigate them. i am currently in one of the worst depressive states i have experienced in years which is really inconvenient considering work has picked up. i go from crying in the bathroom before work about how i would rather just be gone from life not necessarily dead and then an hour later trying to smile and be professional when i see clients. i have a difficult ti ame communicating with my clients and whenever i deal with ones who are upset at the work i have done for them, it crushes me deeper. cuts deeper into how i feel worthless, faulty, not talented, pointless being... etc. i might be paranoid, but it feels like my boss is annoyed at me how i ask her a lot of questions due to me overthinking things or feeling like people are mad at me when maybe they are not. should i tell her that i deal with depression and also anxiety and this is a tough ti ame for me, or should i just continue on and ask the questions i feel?	moderate
why do i not want to talk to my friends anymore and get easily irritated over everything and anyone? i feel like i am slowly starting to lose it and my depression is going to start getting to a point where i can not handle anything anymore, i have been fighting for so long and i have not been able to talk to anyone or legiti amately resolve any of my problems. i have burnt so many bridges with so many people, i get mad and annoyed over everything, to the point where even in school today i literally crumpled up a piece of paper over the teacher telling me i got a wrong answer. i have been thistanced from my friends too and i have given extremely shallow replies and i have barely been in their lives now. i do not know what is happening to me and i do not like it. depression is overtaking me.	moderate

unconscious thiscri amination is evident and it is ruining me. i feel as if thiscri aminated against because of my appearance tl dr because i am short and not attractive, i feel people do not treat me the same as others unconsciously. i am a stereotypical nerd. always does well in school and participates in clubs and all that. what makes me different is that i am a high schooler is who is exactly feet tall. i do not know about the median height where you live but where i live i am about the bottom for my age. i always had a lot of people i could consider friends but it is not the same as having authentic friends. all the friends i had in middle school became the popular group in high school, and i am sti will friends with them today. see, i have known them for years and i have only ever hung out with them once. i feel as if they do not include me but i do not know if that is true. also, i just do not look good. i am not attractive in any way, even though i am short i am somewhat fat as well. i have liked a few people through my high school years, but never have they liked me back. my repulsive face and body, my height, and that fact that no one has ever liked me before just chisels down my confidence. my friends on the other hand just do so much better than me. they have all had girlfriends and they all have hung out with each other multiple ti ames. i enjoy being with my friends in school and i believe they enjoy my presence too. i just feel like the only reason i can not get a partner is due to my height and appearance. i do not believe my friends do this intensionally, but i feel segregated every ti ame i talk to them or i am with them. i remember reading this scientific article about a persons appearance singlehandedly being able to control how many words a person wanted to communicate with them by . maybe this is what is happening to me. i am being unconsciously segregated from everyone i talk to because i look repulsive. i try to dress well, smell nice, and be a nice person who would listen to you and not talk about you behind your back. i just wish i could be included in the grand puzzle of life. what did i do to deserve this? edit spelling and overall stupidity	moderate

it is not about whether people care i always get people care about you or you wi will be missed or whatever when i talk about wanting to die and or ki will myself. it bothers me because these responses focus on what other people have the potential to feel instead of what is actually happening, and that is that i am really suffering. i am dealing with both mental physical health problems w no effective treatment and an upbringing mindset that prevents me from being able to function as i am expected to in society. i am also constantly struggling to accept that the world is fallen , i.e. there is a bad side to everything. i know some people justify wanting to die b c they do not believe the whole people care but i hate being lumped into that. i just want peace and relief and not to have to continuing living in pain just b c it makes other people feel good.	moderate

i am only alive because i am afraid to take my life i have come close to committing, but in the end the fear of going through with it wins out. i reason that eventually the depression wi will outweigh the fear, but until then i am just too much of a coward to do it. it is strange i am not afraid of dying, but of taking my life. i do not have anything to live for. no pets, no children, no friends or family people tend to forget about me unless they need something , nothing. i just wish i could be free of this. i am so tired.	moderate

this is for every living surviving warrior. hello my fellow living warriors , this post is for anyone who is feeling somewhat misplaced , mistreated in life and is suffering from emotional and mental self torture. the world is big and vast and for that there are some topics that not everyone is aware. this would not solve your problems but can make somethings clear. you , like anyone else, were brought into this world and you embodied specific body characteristics , home environment , family , local community , physical and mental ski wills that you did not choose. this makes it look that our lives are not so free as we think. everyone has a journey, a wound and a purpose in life. anything that is alive , even if it is for one second , wi will i ampact in the universe in some way. why would someone be born into this world and repeat the same type of stressful situations over and over ? well, like i said, everyone has a journey and a wound and a purpose , we need obstacles and adversities to progress towards our purpose. what is the point of being born in your best self? what is there to achieve if i already know what i need to know? exactly! you are born to face certain obstacles that wi will make you learn certain lessons in life so that you can progress . you need to let go of the pain and go against the other direction, the right one. i do not mean resistance, but acceptance. life gives us the exact tools for us to achieve our unique purpose ,it presents us with our ski wills , when the ti ame is right it shows us the right people and situations to progress, otherwise you wi will be stuck in a never ending loop. in the end, after every chapter in your life , you wi will thispose what you do not need anymore for your progress. every living thing ,dies every day, we die every day, we thispose of the yesterday and embrace the tomorow, while living and experience the today. it is when you hold the yesterday that pains and stagnates people. we can conclude from this that we grow from hardship and not from stagnation. about other people, when you see someone that has a certain opinion , acts a certain way that goes against your way of being , ask yourself what did this person had to go through to end up like this? you need to accept that people are the way they are, but this does not mean that they have the right to do what they want. know and love who people are , but if needed put them in their place or stop them. do not ruin yourself for others, just accept them. about depression, let us be honest, it is ugly and highly unappealing, but there are ti ames that you need to be thrown to the floor so that you can get back up.we are attracted to smiles , confidence, people who take care of themselves and we reject the opposite , this is mostly unconscious ,but it is in our biology. the way you view life wi will attract like minded people and situations, like i meant earlier, chaos attracts chaos , self love and acceptance attract self love and acceptance. there are certain things that makes men and women more attractive , like having a good straight posture and not being curved, shoulders down or keeping good amount of eye contact when talking to someone instead of not looking at all. fight for yourself, get a house if you can, get a job, it does not matter, just fight. do not be sloppy , do not let go of yourself because you are feeling down. try and be the best version you can be. there are not any heroes , princes , or princesses that wi will come to aid you , you are your own savior. knowing all this , specially the part about life and death , you can develop something inside of you that wi will protect and shield you from these bad moments and that is called faith . no i do not mean religion , i mean faith. faith is when you understand that the obstacles you are given in life are for you to learn and move forward. when you feel that tomorrow wi will be better than today because your learned and let go of something you did not need anymore. faith makes you open your arms to life and whatever it throws you. life wi will open the right doors at the right ti ame for you to fulfi will your purpose, believe me, but mostly believe in yourself . thank you	moderate

i have a stressful month is ahead of me, and the corona virus took away the only thing i was looking forward to. i have been depressed for about years, and ever since going to my first therapist some years ago, i have taken on her advice to try to always have in mind at least one thing to look forward to whether that be a vacation with a friend, a new album soon to be released, or even something as si ample as seeing next weeks episode of a tv show that i enjoy. throughout the last year, that list of things to look forward to has gotten shorter and shorter. at the beginning of this year i had two things on that list a new album by my favourite band, and a concert i was going to with another band. the album was released in february, so the only thing that i have been looking forward to this month was a concert that was supposed to happen tonight. as it so happens, all concerts in my country has been cancelled due to the risk of spreading the corona virus. so now i am sitting here, alone, and i no longer have that one thing i was holding on to. and the month ahead of me is going to be a real stressful one, with lots of big assignments and exams. the previous two weeks have also been stressful, as i have started working on some of the assignments and i have tried my best to keep up with everything going on at school. now i lost that one thing i thought would give me at least a little drip of happiness, a little bit of joy to get through this all. i do not know. i am just very sad, i mean, i am more sad than usual. i am not just empty, i am actually feeling real sadness. i feel like i have lost something, as dramatic as that may sound but that is what i feel. i do not know what the point if this post was. i think i just felt like i needed to share this with someone.	moderate

am i really depressed? hello. this wi will be my first ever post on reddit. i am here to seek comfort or probably just to rant. i have been having weird thoughts for awhile now. i keep hearing voices in my head. it keeps bugging me and i wi will get so angry. i wi will start thinking of all the things that upset me. i hate being at home. i was born in a broken family. my parents argue everyday. my father was abusive and i grew up watching my mother getting beaten up half to death and it is the same for us too. my dad only comes home once or twice a week now. lately he has been more religious and has been making amends. my mother seems to forgive hi am so easily and continue on to be submissive. it irks me so much. she does not work and wait for my dad to give her money monthly. he gives her a very small amount and idk why she is even doing this to herself. working as a cleaner would allow her to bring more money home than what my father would give her. i wish they would just get a divorce. i hate that they are just staying together for the sake of it thinking that it is for the best. everyti ame i look at my mother, i get very angry and upset and wish she had the guts to take the leap and leave my stupid father and just have a life of her own with all of us. i am also sti will studying my bachelors and it is been so difficult for me. i do not have the support of anybody to be giving me school money and i can not find the ti ame to work part ti ame as my assignments and exams pile up a lot in a short period of ti ame. my boyfriend is the one that has been supporting me since day . everyday i can not help but to feel like a burden. i have never borrowed money from anyone before and now, i can not even keep track on how much money my boyfriend has spend on me. he keeps saying that he does not mind and that when i get a job things wi will get better. but i feel guilty and completely useless. everything in my life is taking a toll on me lately and i keep having the urge to hurt myself. i would punch the wall when i am angry ti will my hands really hurt. and someti ames i feel like just inflicting pain to my body just so i could feel i ammense pain and stop the loud thoughts in my head. i am getting scared and worried. i share this with my boyfriend often and he wi will always comfort me but i can not help to feel that he would be so much better without me.	moderate
pointless event so yeah i am m and its going to sound stupid but there is this girl i have been talking to who i like and they just said they liked me but i ended up just leaving her on read. it is just that they do not know about my depression or self harm and it is just i am scared that if they found out they wouldn t like the real me so instead i am just pushing them away, now i just feel guilty for leading them on as i believe deep down i knew that it would never really work out. now just because of my issues they are going to be upset which is just unfair on them. i know that i am never going to really be able to be in a relationship as i am inevitably going to commit suicide but then as a result i just feel so alone. i just want it all to end but am struggling to get the courage to ki will myself but this might have been the final straw. after being depressed for so long i thought that a relationship might be what fixes it all but if that clearly would not work i do not know what wi will.	moderate

today i broke down at work... this morning started off terrible with a leak of unknown origins in my car that seemed a lot like brake fluids with the information i had. overall i have a good ti ame at work since its really the only place i ever go that is social . today i got so overwhelmed with not only a clog of my own work but busy helping others because they were in the space i needed and the area itself was a complete trip fall hazard. i spent minutes helping another department while those in that department thisappeared. i got so frustrated and upset i just started crying and once i cry there is no hiding it because my eyes turn super red like i am stoned out of my mind. one of my supervisors came and checked up on me multiple ti ames once he found out. and several coworkers gave me hugs and one even took over what i was doing so i could take a minute break instead of the usual . i wanted to spend it alone in my car and when i walked outside i remembered i did not even drive to work today so my car is at home so i sat in the basement instead of the break room. back to my supervisor because this really made my day and it meant a lot to me the last half hour in the shift he pulled my aside and wanted to makw sure nothing happened and that he did not put too much pressure on me because of what was happening he did not but the fact that he seemed to genuinely care about what happened and what he could do to make sure it did not happen again meant a lot.	moderate
i have no friends i have pushed so many people away in my life that i am sti will in contact with friends from high school, but nobody actually is close to me enough to actually spend ti ame with me. it was the biggest mistake of my life because for the first ti ame since i have been in school, i feel completely alone.	moderate

i am ready for a big change... i am posting here to share some very difficult and personal feelings i have struggled with for almost years. i am a male and have struggled with depression since i was about . lately it has gotten worse and harder to control. i am ready to seek help and am looking for advice on where to start. first off i wi will say i am an intensely private person so it is very much out of my comfort zone to be sharing these thoughts with complete strangers but i do not think i have much to lose at this point. so i am just going to be black and white about my main problems. . i hate my job. i am a machinist and know it is not really for me. i have ideas about new potential careers such as obtaining a cdl but i am so convinced that i wi will fail at this or any other career for that matter. that feeling of being a failure can be pretty much applied to anything i do. . i recently ended a year relationship that was incredibly toxic but i am having a hard ti ame adjusting. i know it is for the best, but i am hung up on what happened and am struggling with coming to terms with having to let that person go for good. . i moved across the country about . years ago and while i love my new state a lot has happened and it is been extremely difficult adjusting at ti ames. i also miss my friends and family from back east. . i feel numb most of the ti ame. it is so hard to feel any real joy or happiness. i just feel hollow and life feels unfulfi willing. i struggle with suicidal thoughts at ti ames because i can not i amagine living like this for the rest of my life. i can not even bring myself to cry anymore. . i have so many goals i want to meet but i do not have the strength or ambition to pursue them. this makes me feel useless and like a complete failure. . i absolutely feed my own depression with bad habits but i can not seem to change them at least not permanently . this makes me feel like i can not even change even though i desperately want to. . i feel detached from most people and have very little faith in humanity in general. i do not care for the way the world is today at all. i do not want to be this person. i know i am wasting my life being stuck in this hopeless rut. i want help and i want to change. i know i have a lot of potential but i need motivation to reach said potential. i am sick and tired of feeling like a shell of a human being. please, if you can offer any advice i would love to hear from you. i wouldn t wish this on my worst enemy. this is not living it is merely existing and i can not get through life like this.	moderate
i live worst life ever possible. i need help m, i am living in russia. i have only mother left. my grandmother is very sick and tied to a bed. my mom is taking care of her. father is rarely in touch and living far away. i have an uncle beside them. my first girl, now ex gf of almost years left me recently, and i am serving probation for a stupid mail order of lsd in my s, which i wanted to try out of curiosity as a musician and reader. so i do not have anyone to help me besides my mom, and my life is fucked up because of a cri aminal record. my girl left me, and so did my friends. i wi will never be able to move out of my country, and i can not find a job, because of my record. i just stay at home now alone, because my mom supports me, and looking for a job. i just cry daily and can not stand myself anymore. i fucked my life early on, and i wi will never be able to do anything with it anymore. drug record messed relationships. i want to end it, but my mom that truly loves me, that is what stops me. i do not have any friends anymore, only or good friends from my childhood. i am getting into alcohol to ease it a bit. i used to smoke weed, it helped i ammersively, but now i can not. i used to be the center of company and fine dude, and now i am miserable, dying inside. i took a break from university, to find a job, but it is so hard. it is getting darker every day, and i see myself in the end.	moderate
i do not have any friends except for my girlfriend so i have a big problem with making friends, i am not that type of guy to just start a conversation. i do not have anything to talk about, i am not a very interesting person. i had a handfull of people that i called friends, they were always there for me when i needed it. at the begining of summer something happened and one of them came up to me and said that they all do not want to see, talk or hear about me ever again. that hurt alot, losing my only friends meant that i wi will be alone. i think it was at that point when my depression kicked in. i did not want my mom to think that i am a loser so i just went out saying that i was going out with friends when in reality i would just sit at the park for hours doing nothing. i sti will do it now. i do not know how but a few months ago i got a girlfriend, we spent ti ame together alot and i started feeling better again, but now we see each other only ti ames a week and i feel that things are getting worse for me again. i know that i can overcome my depression by being around people that care for me. i feel like i need to find at least one friend that i could hang out with, but i do not know how. can someone please tell me some tips on how to find friends? school is not an option because most people at school hate me. my class mates are not the best aswell...	moderate

i am honestly pissed, and it has come to a point that i just hate everyone. i am just fucking sick and tired, i am done, i really am fucking done. everyday is like a fucking mental war between life and death, i am over here forcing myself to stay alive hoping that something good would happen, while the other side of me understands the truth and knows that my life is shit. i am fucking done with everyone. i feel as if all of my friends just say that they are my friends just so they can use me for shit, i am sick and tired of being constantly reminded every. single. damn. day that no one loves me and that no one wi will love me, and that no one cares about me, and that i most likely have no friends, in all honesty i look like a freak if i should say the least. i am fucking done, i am really just about done. fuck everyone, fuck my friends, fuck my family, fuck my school, fuck corona virus, fuck everyone. there is like only a few people that i actually like. i am sorry if this goes on forever and ever, but seriously, everyday when i feel like i have an actual friend, i am always ditched and not cared about. i get it universe, no one cares about me, and no one loves me. i am starting to come to the point in losing my trust in everyone. i felt like i lost everything, i lost the love of my life, i lost all of my self respect and confidence, i lost my wi will to live, and i bet these friends of mine do not really care about me. i am seriously thinking about suicide everyday, but i can not!!! cause i am too much of a fucking wuss, so now i am starting to get back into drinking booz and shit drowning all if my anger, sadness, and hate. good day.	moderate

life has gone to sh t again trying to make this as short as possible, i am a failure, so do not expect me to successfully write a summary. male , from central europe. last years were basically hell on earth for me new class, fewer and fewer friends, depression, anxiety, worse grades, pressure from parents increase in being bullied from teachers, students, old people, fkn everyone hated me, like i am some kind of postal dude . but this shit all does not matter and it would make this crappy text even longer so i do not put it in here. pulled serious non acting suicide attempts in november , could not make it because i am too fkn stupid to ki will myself properly like an honorable person. after that being in shallow treatment, where the psychiatrist is a psychopath herself with no empathy whose thinking is all about cause and effect. cancelled this crap after sessions, she just made me feel uncomfortable and more depressed what irony. parents were like oh hey you re back? my son we re sooo sorry insert shallow acted empathy here do you know how much you hurt us with that suicide attempt?? but now that you have talked to this very good psychiatrist, you are cured right?? . after realising how shallow my parents were i was just like yeah like you would care , but i did not say that. so after that incident i kinda just stayed in contact with one person, a friend who is my age. he is also a drug dealer and we would see some herb now and then to kind of cope with life. in i basically went downright crazy, i told myself okay, now that i know that i dropped out of school, wi will never have a stable job i did apply for many, never got one , wi will never have a girlfriend, because i am a virgin and anxious, that my life has no meaning and i do not fit in the whole system and can not seem to find happiness in a healthy legal way, i wi will just fuck my body up with dxm , a strong hallucinogenic cough suppressant, which goes nuts in your brain and liver in high doses. my plan would be either dying from acute liver failure or some chronic body i willness, that would reduce my life expectancy. i do not care about my life and i do not see why i should fight for it. i tried to give life many more chances and i put efforts in many things but nothing was good enough. in the last weeks my situation has worsened, as i had spent hundreds of euros around on herb, melatonin and dxm just to get high or to help me sleep. i did not care if i would become a junkie or not and i sti will do not do. when i was on a solid rd plateau a few days ago i had been sleep deprived for months and in these days i have probably slept for hours in total i totally became insane, got some nice drug induced psychosis, lost my identity ego death and i was so overwhelmed with experiencing my life going out of hand like that that i just laughed. i thought about ki willing myself and i just laughed. i did not feel anything, i was robowalking through my room in a creepy way and would just say completely crazy shit like once i am finally dead, i wi will be finally able to free the jesus sculptures in the church insert maniac laughter now i am lying in my bed sleep deprived, confused, not able to detect how i feel, thinking about why the hell i should continue life. death could just swipe all my problems away, because i go insane if i do not do drugs in life. but drugs do destroy my life in other ways, and i am a bit aware of that, it just does not matter to me. my tendency would be to pull one really good planned multi suicide attempt, so that i can finally get over with this shit, as nobody wi will ever love my character and you know why? because there is no real me, i si amply do not exist, i am just a mirror that thisplays emotions from others trying to make them like me. i am very very confident, there is no single fucking individual out there, who would really care about me or my death. i just know how all of them are faking, because they are expected to react that way when someone pulls a suicide attempt. well, might as well be successful this ti ame, i wi will never experience true love anyway. i mean, which woman does want a mentally insane boyfriend or husband? do not get me wrong, i would love to have a girlfriend, not just for the erotic aspect. i want to make her feel comfortable around me, help her with chores, release her from stress stuff like that. i basically want someone to care about who also cares about me in a way. i miss that feeling, even though i did never experience it. the pain gets stronger and stronger, the dxm effects are slowly wearing off, making my emotions negative emotions come back. i feel the stomach tilting feeling of just wanting to die creeping up on me. while i am typing this my fingers are shaking, my mind is blank, my heartrate is high as i myself was high on drugs within the last months. cold sweating, but deep down inside myself i know, that there really is one thing to do. one. option. that is the perfect solution. all pain gone at once. never experiencing depression and hopelessness ever again. being si amply gone for good. i already see the people ignoring this post or commenting the typical stuff like tell x or y or do not commit suicide, we need you, you are one of us or you can sti will change, it is never too late or suicide is a permanent solution for a non permanent problem . i know encouraging suicide is not a thing either, but to me all of those sayings just seem to be the same to me. i do not know what i expect from you guys, i am just wasting your ti ame what am i doing have a good one, i wi will just try to make a plan for the next attempt, this life is gone anyways.	moderate
friends stopped trying to help me. i am an absolute dumbass. got drunk and angry a few days ago, shouted a lot, told my friends that i did not care about my health anymore, that i did not want help and that i would refuse any help if offered. they actually did what i asked them to do. they stopped worrying caring about me. i am a lost cause. this is entirely my fault and i am ashamed of how i acted. from now on, they just do not act the same with me, like if i was some kind of stranger. no more smiles, nothing. no more please eat something , stop drinking , stop cutting yourself or some how are you doing? every while and then. i have been an absolute idiot for refusing help just because i thought that i had to deal with my own problems and man up. for someone who wanted some peace and quiet, i am served.	moderate
birthdays suck i do not know how to explain this correctly so it might not make sense but i want to get it off my chest. my birthday was on the th. when i was a kid birthdays were great! seemed like every year they got better and better until they started getting worse. i learned to lower my expectations. then for a few years only a couple people would wish me a happy birthday. i did not even mind not getting attention on my birthday. i have a few people that i used to be super close with but i do not talk to anymore because of a bunch of different reasons. they were kinda toxic for me and wouldn t put in the same effort into our relationship that i did. after i stopped putting in effort, they did not talk to me anymore. it was super hard for me to realize that someone i used to be so close with did not like me anymore. anyti ame they reach out i remember how awful they made me feel. for the past years these people from my past have reached out to wish me a happy birthday and i thank them and i appreciate the thought but every ti ame i talk to them, it brings be back to the feelings i had at this low point in my life. it sucks that a nice gesture on a day that is supped to be fi willed with happiness can make me feel so sad. knowing that these people wi will reach out to me makes me dread my birthday every year.	moderate

i wi will forever be alone ive never had a girlfriend, everygirl ive liked ive been shut down, and when i think girls like me they dont? when a girl that i like liked me back, we really didnt even like eachother. were more like brother and sister. but its probably because i have horrible genes, arent special in any way and have a horrible fucking family. ive just accepted the fact that no girl wi will like me ever, and i was born to be lonely. i admitted that i had been having dark thoughts to a girl i loved, she said she loved me and for a short while i felt complete. but she lied, when i said i liked her she blocked me and she and her friends bullied me at school, and she had alot of friends, and now i am just nmb, and that is why whenever i get a compli ament out of the blue i am speechless, any girl i am friends with i never share me feeling because of my extreme fear of pain and rejection and the fear of losing my friends and being some pathetic loser again.	moderate

not feeling enough and wanting to lighten my heart by sharing hi reddit, this is going to be one of my first posts so bear with me. i was feeling blue and did not really know what to do except for just lying in my bed, listening to loud music and staring at my laptop screen and feeling empty. so i came across this subreddit and after reading some of the posts here i thought that i might feel better to just write a fucking post to get it all out. i am an anxious person. i love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how i deal with it is to make myself busy with life. school and side activities, part ti ame jobs and partying. but now that i have had extra ti ame i get remembered of demons and all the reasons why i think i am a failure. first, i get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. i have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and i have seven nieces. i am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since i came into the picture rather late. my relationship with my siblings is non existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. i also live in another city than them which does not make it easier to get in touch. i feel like i actually do not know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. i do not know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. and the thing is i really do want to get closer to them, but i get so anxious around them and i can not relax. i feel like a personality less person who does not even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because i have this barrier that would not let me just be calm and be myself. the only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol does not mix well together. but i love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. but the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that would not let me leave the bed and i would not even open my phone for hours because i always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though i know that there is not anything bad there. when i am feeling my worst this anxiety would not let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one wi will find me. my mailbox, both email and at home get fi willed because i have the fear of finding something i would not like. i, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since i do not have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. i wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school. but i always tell myself that i am not enough for anyone and that i am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. but i have had guys showing interest in me, but i get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. and then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it is for the best because i like being alone anyways. friends. i have met a lot of people in my life, but i am not very good at keeping them in my life. people try to get into my life but i get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. or when i am with people i actually do like i get scared that i am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. i get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that wi will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and i am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they would not leave the salon. that is why, if i do not get invited to one smaller thing or do not hear of something they all seem to know i take it so fucking personal even though they did not even mean to not include me. but since i am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and i start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck i am doing on this planet. i suck at calling people or asking people how they are. maybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and i hope that i wi will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry! because anxiety. lots of love from this anxiety fi willed blob.	moderate
advice for people recovering? i think i am getting better with depression. i have not fallen into a deep episode mainly because i look at for it. mindfulness helped a lot for me. but the problem i have now is pain , bad sleep, and lack of focus. it is like all the thoughts of depression is gone but most of the symptoms say behind. i do not know if it is a medicine issue or something. anyone has any ideas what to do?	moderate
today i told my parents about wanting to see a psychiatrist so i have been high functioning depressed without a medical examination for years now, but recently it has become significan notly harder to suppress it. so i told my parents that i want to see a psychiatrist, they were supportive and agreed even though they think it is just anxiety which i hope , i kinda leaned towards letting them know that i am suicidal but they freaked so i kept that to myself. i really believe that this is the best way to go about it...	moderate
i hate myself everyday, i wake up having anxiety attacks after realizing that i am not where i want to be in life. i have had a host of issues. i helped take care of my grandmother from until she passed away. i did not graduate college until age . at almost , i have been unemployed for nearly a year. i live with my parents. i worked a few dead end jobs because i was struggling with my mental health and did not know wtf i wanted to do with my life. looking at my other cousins, i see them ultra successful making nearly figures and we re all the same age. i am at a point where i am starting to pick myself back up and try again. i want to attend grad school and i finally have a few job interviews lined up. i really want to get my own place this year, workout again, and study for the gre. it does not help that my family members basically call me a loser without explicitly saying it. i am so damn tired.	moderate
coronavirus is destroying my mental health i live with my parents due to financial hardships and we have a pretty toxic relationship. theyve locked me down on quarantine away from my life partner whom i havent seen in weeks and i dont know when i wi will see them again. being locked down away from my support system is making my depression and anxiety unbearable. anyone in a si amilar situation or have some words of support?	moderate
anger and pain that is all i feel now. i can not even enjoy sex or the most basic things that bring me joy or make me feel like a real person. i feel spent, like i have nothing left like i can not even manifest a little happiness for a second. i am in a relationship that feels like it is tearing my soul in half and i know that it is all my fault that i am in this position. i feel guilty whether i do or do not. i feel bitter at the world and people that seem to be free from their psychological prison. i need alcohol or weed just to feel comfortable and i smoke cigarettes more than i breath air it feels like. the worst part is that i got over a serious episode before one step in front of the other. one day at a ti ame and one hurdle at a ti ame. but i do not know if i see the point anymore i want to talk to people about it but they do not really care, and i understand why. when i was free for about years i am ashamed to say but i looked down on people for being depressed. i looked down on my former self and felt relieved that i was not struggling anymore. but that seems like a thistant memory now. nothing rolls of my back i feel suicidal but also homicidal it seems so easy for my mind to get there now. someti ames i wi will just get such intense emotion i can not even understand why i am sti will living it does not make sense. you d think i would just end it but i know that there can be light at the end of the tunnel. i felt it. i felt what it is like to not be like this to not hate myself and everyone around me, to take pride in what i did and who i was. but each ti ame i break down and succumb to my emotion i feel my grip slipping and ik that if i give in enough ti ames i wi will be gone. i do not want to die, but i can not keep feeling this way it is tearing me apart. i feel damned if i do and damned if i do not. i feel trapped and suffocated and who knows maybe i do not have much ti ame left.	moderate
i am trapped in living i am m , all the friends i have known for years have changed and moved on whilst i feel like the same dumb kid i have always been, i am just not one of them, more of a straggler or someone who they always invite then remember i am not a good ti ame. my only daily activities include working, playing mindless ai am trainers on my pc until i pass out and then i wake up and work again, it is a dead end supermarket job where i just work and work with no days off as despite always being more of an introvert i have found recently that i am starting to feel alone. at i have never been in a relationship, kissed or even really talked to a girl in that way. i am ugly, that is just a fact and fuck all this your beautiful in your own way shit that is not true at all. i am in no way an incel in that i am not condemning women for not wanting anything to do with me i wouldnt want to be with me either and that is just life, honestly i only stay alive to not hurt family and make my sister fucked up. you can say i am young and make new friends but it is not that easy, i am no longer in any form of school and i am not committed enough or can really afford uni, work colleagues r all older and all that are my age have their established friendships already with their little groups, i am fucking miserable. tell me how to get my life better if you want but i do not believe it is possible i have always been a bit off and friends used to make jokes about my mood swings but now maybe i am fucked up. this is just a dumb rant from a stupid kid with no motivation really to live and i can not really ever commit to a relationship as with all relationships chances r they wi will end and badly and something that makes you happy makes you sad again. i doubt anyone is read this and if you have hope your having a better life than me and enjoy what you have b you wake up and it is all gone and your the one wanting to go back to when you were and things were so good. no way anyone is read all this you would have given up after the first few words i am that pathetic oh well	moderate
just can not seem to get my shit together. everyti ame i think i have finally got the motivation to do go towards my goals and do the things i wanted i end up relapsing and hating myself more than ever. i really think i am a pussy for not doing things that i can easily get over with and want to do but something keeps holding me back. that something is the fact that i am a scared pussy. i do not have the balls to do lots of things and i hate myself for it. someti ames i really can not help myself and i feel really down about it. i am just not happy with who i am, and maybe it is down to insecurity, but i do not know how to change that. i try but i always end up relapsing back to my shameful habits of being lazy and whatnot. and it is been like this for so long, it is like i am at a standsti will in life, where nothings going on, and i am just waiting for something to happen. meanwhile the ti ame is flying and i am sti will here.	moderate

deeply worried about coronovirus i have been heavily depressed for the past years. i live in a small flat in a mostly quiet town and i rely on the government for financial support. i sit most days in my flat with the four walls as my closest companion. i feel on a day to day basis my depression is in a intertwined dance with my anxiety. its so deeply bad i someti ames have a fear of my surroundings and reality. this epidemic seems pretty major which is sending my notorious anxiety crazy. i fear there wi will be no food to eat and chaos among society. my mind plays countless frightening scenarios in my head. my depression always lingers and grips me tight though, reminding me of the pit i am destined to be in, even in a normal world. anxiety and depression are evil twins embedded in my mind. can anyone relate?	moderate

when you realise covid maybe the answer... so if you re anything like me, which chances are someone is, then you re not scared of this new virus. at the end of the day i have harming techniques that that help me get by poor diet poor sleep pattern poor hygiene each for a reason, for example when someone says how are you tired is an acceptable answer. no more question. poor diet and hygiene are to increase the likelihood of getting an i willness that hospitalises me and also helps me feel on the outside like i do on the inside. but does any one realise what is going on? nope, not even the folk i live with. so with all of that i have become more susceptible to sickness which mean i could relatively easily catch the dreaded c word not that one . and i am excited not scared. if i get sick and die then it does not matter cos that is a natural thing, life goes on with out me and without blaming me.	moderate

depression in a relationship i am in a year relationship with my girlfriend and i have been suffering with depression since i was a teenager. my depression has gone pretty bad and frequently lately and it shows in our relationship. my girlfriend knows i have been suffering for this for awhile but someti ames she does not understand how to handle my state because she never had any experience before which i do not blame her. for the past year, we been in fights and our communication has been good lately. we tried to talk things out but when we do, my depression would kick in because i felt so bad about myself and our relationship. i feel most of the ti ame my depression comes from our relationship. i dont know if i should break up with my girlfriend. i sti will love her but i feel she is getting frustrated with trying to help me. our relationship is becoming unheathly. someti ames i feel if we were to break up, we wouldn t put the pressure on each other anymore.	moderate
no one cares about you when you become an adult do not get me wrong, children are the most vulnerable part of our population so medical, educational, and financial programs to help kids are very i amportant. but man, once you hit that y o mark it is like society could not give less of a fuck. got cancer? too bad. mental health issues? good luck figuring out that shit on your own buddy. unemployed and about to be homeless? better find a good bench to sleep under! and it seems like the older you get, the less people care. i did not ask to be born or thrown into this world, yet i am expected to work until i am literally to decrepit to be useful anymore. all of that with mental i willness and barely any support. i know people wi will tell me to just get over myself but i feel like i had to get that off my chest.	moderate
i wish i could believe that people liked me my parents and close friends always tell me that i am fun to be around, and that people enjoy my company...but i see so many signs that it just is not true in my daily life. maybe my counselor is right that i am seeing life through jaded glasses, but that just does not seem to be the case when i observe how others get treated relative to how i get treated. why does it seem that people ignore my texts? why does it seem that people avoid me? i feel like i can make friends so easily, but after they meet who i am none of them want to be friends anymore. just surface relationships. and what hurts more is that i talk to my coworker who deals with depression, they say they have the same thing happen to them people avoiding them, etc . the mistreatment is awfully thiscouraging. but when she takes her meds, she forgets about it...and acts like it is solved even though i sti will see people mistreat her the way i feel like i get mistreated. does anyone else feel like everyone thislikes them even though it might not be true? how do you deal with this when you can not choose the people you have to be around?	moderate

my shitty comedy of a love life my love life is a very shitty comedy. i wouldn t mark it up as a tragedy because in retrospect it is really fucking hilarious but arguably one of the largest sources for the depression i am currently in now. i wanted to post this on here to see if i could possibly get any advice and or support mostly because my friends in real life keep shoveling me the same shit over and over again. alright anyway let us begin. th grade year my first year of middle school. i had all of the normal classes and pretty much a standard setup. i go through about let us say months worth of school before i caught eye of this girl that i thought was pretty cute. my mind pretty much wiped all memory of interactions so some might be out of order on a general ti ame line . i do not remember how exactly, but i got into contact with a friend of the girl i was interested in, i wi will call her l. fuck i can not remember anything from this ti ame period . anyway i think i remember using her as some agent garbo type shit. tl dr i end up doing some really weird shit which i wi will list down below playing the knife game to get pity from the girl i like scratched my skin with a kitchen knife and sent a picture to the girl asked the girl who her next boyfriend was going to be winked at her for no reason hindu habbibi instagram compli aments i feel like i am describing something a weird fuck would do but this was actually what i did. jesus christ. so th grade ended with some decent grades but i had pretty much no progress with this girl. i also did a naughty no no mustache man salute in band class. th grade year so this is my th grade year and i am back in full force. i tried asking the girl out but of course it was too awkward to even sound like a sentence. anyway a ti ame jump is deserved here since nothing really happens until the beginning of th grade year. right now is basically an intermission to another act. i finally got my hair cut from some ozzy osbourne type shit to iraq war radio backpack skinhead type shit. my relationship with l got a bit closer with some phone calls. i think it was around this ti ame where she got a boyfriend. it may sound like that relationship would have went somewhere but she was taller than me and already told me how she would never date me. th grade year a turning point alright the first nine weeks of my th grade year is what is probably a defining part of my s experience. so i have completely given up on that one girl and turned my attention to a new girl, i wi will call her f. anyway i had art for the first nine weeks which put me in the same class with her. i had one of my old elementary school girl friends as a double agent to communicate with f too. this is going to be a theme on this show . i barely communicated directly with f, which was completely different from my last interaction with what i wi will just call z for si amplicity now. so the f relationship was getting nowhere and z got another boyfriend. here is where it gets interesting. z accidentally posts her, how do i say this, naughty no clothes pics all over snapchat. this was by accident, the intention was to send it to her boyfriend. of course i rode the bus with her and as some fucked retributive tribal warfare, i started to make fun of her. every. single. day. so this got so bad that i was called down to the office one day and i was just told to stop doing it. i am surprised i did not get a harsher punishment. around this point f told my double agent that she would never date me as well. yeah i know i know my plan was perfect how could it fail? so another intermission between now and near the tail end of the year until i started looking around in my band. i find this really beautiful girl who looks like a d ani ame girl in my band on percussion. how the fuck does this happen. so this new thing started. i wi will call her g. l also happened to be friends with her too. so i suppose it is ti ame to list some things that happened before this initial moment of realization that doomed me from the start i have barely talked to her she witnessed my heige seil i made fun of her a few ti ames, accident and on purpose alright so there was a chicken pox problem in our school around state testing ti ame in . what i did not know was that g got chicken pox because her parents are anti vax so her entire family got it lol , which completely fucked all of the kids who did not have the chicken pox vaccine. i get banished from our school in the middle of testing season which completely fucked over my schedule. tl dr i had to take a few tests inside of the office, which may or may not have contributed to my shitty test scores that year. i come back to school and i am so pissed that i just rant and rave about some degenerate who got chicken pox. so math class comes and i continue to bitch about it and i only had this revelation that she was the one who got chicken pox in the summer of . like holy shit what are the chances. not only did i make fun of her those many ti ames, act like a fucking maniac eating shit out of garbage cans and off of the floors did not mention that earlier did i lol , now i have just called her a fucking degenerate retard. i was going to ask her to formal but it was held during my quarantine, so i could not even go. th grade year tl dr homecoming is around the corner and i attempt to ask g. i could not even say anything as i was awkwardly standing next to her locker. it could have been worse. this one was the worst for me. it built up for a half year and then it crumbled within a day. i do not know what my friends were thinking at the ti ame but later on they commented on how they hope something like this never happens again. anyway this next girl i wi will call her k basically fucked with me for like weeks for some reason. i thought i got lucky but then i realized what was actually happening. it went from like a mild sadness to just no mans land with a nerf gun. present so now in the present i am currently crushing over this junior that said hi to me once and initiated some small talk. i have fixed most of the problems with my last attempts along with continuing to maintain our band storage units just to gain some gta san andreas respect points. i think this shit has contributed to why i believe everyday is a cycle. everyday feels the same unless i interact with this one individual. along with the fact that anything that is happy in nature does the opposite for me. i have no idea what i am going to do next, but this week break that we just got courtesy of mike dewine should help. i hope reading this was not too much of a pain because i am too fucking lazy to proofread this, along with the fact that i doubt my memory is accurate since i have kind of mashed th and th grade together. i wonder what your comments wi will be and i wi will provide any context that is needed, hopefully.	moderate
do not ever say things can not get worse sorry this is quite narcissistic and vent y, i just really need to let this all out i thought my life was bad. all my friends abandoned me are just generally apathetic towards me, i did not get into my dream uni even though i was practically overqualified for it, i have an eating thisorder that i have allegedly recovered from but more because i am too depressed to do anything about it, i can not hang onto a job for any long period of ti ame, and any ti ame i ask for help the door gets shut in my face, and so i felt that i was just watching all my peers experiencing life whilst i waste away. so what do i do? i book a holiday to visit family and get it out of my system. i decide to write an anonymous message to the boy i have been in love with for months and who i have some inkling might like me back . and i am thinking ok this could be the beginning but haha!!!!! i thought it was going to be a good ti ame but no! i get fucking sexually assaulted by a family member, someone i knew and loved and trusted and was probably aware of how vulnerable i was. and now i have to live with that on top of everythinh else. so now i am too anxious and depressed and scared to do anything, and if the boy i like did like me back, it is too fucking late now because it is been weeks and i am too ducking terrified to check social media or anything so i have managed to lose hi am in this mess alongside any trust i had of my family. never ever say things can not get worse because they do, after rock bottom there is another rockier bottom. so honestly i barely see the point in going on. in some ways, i almost feel my life is such a horrible joke that i detach myself from reality and just laugh, as if life is some video game i am playing. but honestly i just feel so exhausted and heavy all the ti ame and i do not think there is a way out. i am in therapy, and my parents know about the assault, but i just feel like everything is too much, i am too much, i just want a really long sleep.	moderate

suicide on my mind i wi will try my best to keep this short and sweet i have had depression for half of my life, starting when i was years old. i am now. i did not have the best childhood but that is for a different story. i have been crying every day here lately and it is drained so much out of me. my appearance is shit ball, i no longer do my makeup, wear nice clothes, and my hair is just a rat is nest. i do not really talk to anybody about my depression anymore, other than when my boyfriend sees me crying and i have to tell hi am why. all of the years since my depression first started i have given up hope on medication. every single ti ame i went to my old psychiatrist, it seems like i was on a different medication every ti ame i walked out. i felt like a zombie and it robbed me of my teenage years. i am not on medication anymore. my life got better but now it is getting worse. and it would not stop until i am dead i guess. i have set a date to ki will myself but that is far into the future, october of this month. that is plenty of ti ame to maybe let therapy work and try to make myself happier. i know how i am going to do it but i want to try and get better first. i am going to try therapy again next week, but it is just so hard to talk. i can not force the words out on how i feel. the nastiest, lowest, worst feeling ever. i can not go on like this. it hurts every single day and i have no friends because i am too antisocial to go out and make any, and people get on my nerves. i hope before october i can get my ged i dropped out of high school the exact day i turned , school was hell and i did so much better after i got out! and go to college to hopefully work in my dream career someday. i slacked on getting my license, but i have had my permit for the required ti ame but i sti will do not have my license. i am too afraid of driving. my anxiety makes a common fear for first drivers literal agony as i sit in the drivers seat but i know i need my license if i want to go to college. i really really do not know what to do right now and i do not have anything worth staying alive for right now, and i feel very selfish because i have a family and a boyfriend and his family, my nd family who loves me but it sti will does not seem like enough. i really do not know what to do right now and suicide seems like it can not wait.	moderate

i do not get it. friends leave, and quickly. i would say i am an above average looking female. guys talk to me but only for sex, or expecting it lowkey. i am sti will in love with my ex. basically, i can not say i am depressed as most people would say they are. but when no one talks to me i feel very lonely and sad, lowers my confidence and i do not move for hours and hours and stay in one spot. the depression hits when i am not working. it is pretty awful all these bad feelings come when i have free ti ame. i wish i could have that girl friend or someone to talk to and really understand me. my ex used to be my best friend, and always by my side. we did not have the happiest relationship and i kind of depended on hi am in a toxic fashion to make me happy. he was the only person i really talked to for the past years. we sti will talk but he has moved on and i have not. i am so broken by it. when i opened up social media accounts, i realized that alot of guys from my past and such have reached out to me and i have hung out with a few. only to know they only wanted sex the whole ti ame, where some have come on to me and i stopped it from happening. coming home those nights just crushed me. and those guy friends, stopped talking to me as well as soon as they knew they were friendzoned. at work, i have a few co workers that are nice and we talk but only really at work. one even invited me out a few ti ames and we drank together, but of course she had her whole family cousins etc with her at the ti ame so the attention was not just focused on me. i even had to be picture girl and take pictures of just them and she never included me in any of the pictures of the nights we had. i felt hurt by it, since she says i am such a good friend to her. she rarely texts me and invites me out anymore. i have texted her but it gets cut off pretty quickly. i just wish someone had put me on a pedastool like i do with others. i am always there, i may not have the most unique and exciting personality but i sure wear my heart on my sleeve. i just want to fucking give up on being such a nice person to people and start being a cold bitch, although i am super warm and caring on the inside to those who show me any sort of appreciation or attention. sorry if there was not a point i just needed to vent. and if someone could help or say kind words at this ti ame it would be appreciated. i just do not know what to do. i know i need to focus on me but i never have the motivation to do so unless its exercise or something. thank you for reading..	moderate
how do i stop pushing away the people i love? advice please f , taking depression meds every months when i think things are finally looking up, for some reason i start thistancing myself from those closest to me. my friends usually stick with me the first couple ti ames no idea why since they deserve better but eventually they assume i am thisinterested or we re growing apart, when in reality i am thistancing myself and i do not know why. this fall i found the first group of friends that make me want to leave bed, and a few months ago i started dating my best friend and i think i am in love. this has been the best few months of my life and i actually enjoyed going through each day. i thought i might have finally broken the cycle. but the other day i noticed it starting again. my boyfriend asked me to hang out and i i ampulsively made up a bullshit excuse for god knows why. i just did it again tonight. and yesterday i found myself struggling to sustain eye contact with hi am. i know he is noticed by now and i can tell he is confused and hurt. i hate myself for hurting hi am like this. i feel like a terrible girlfriend and human being. he does not deserve this. i have no control over the cycle. i can not lose hi am or anyone else i love. if anyone can relate or offer some advice or anything that might help i would be eternally grateful. lots of love to anyone on this subreddit reading this. lt 	moderate
do i have depression? i know that i can not be diagnosed on here, but i want an opinion on whether or not i may have it. here is what i am experiencing i am , for context no inner thoughts, just made up scenarios and music in my head bad hygiene. i make sure that i do not smell bad while at school and keep my hair clean, but that is about it i bite my nails and the skin around them, this has been going on for as long as i can remember i eat out of boredom and have gained lbs as a result. i do not like my body and it holds me back from living my life and doing things, but i never follow through and lose weight. no care for anything anymore. i used to be the most empathetic and caring person, but i feel desensitized to most things and never worry or care about anything can not laugh easily anymore. i used to laugh all the ti ame, at everything. i guess that as you get older that happens, but i literally do not find anything funny that other people do and i can not remember the last ti ame i laughed really hard i never feel truly happy. if i get something i have been looking forward to a new phone, for example i wi will be super happy, but that is it. nothing makes me really think or care. like the coronavirus for example, i just am like oh, ok i always sit around on my phone and do nothing when i could be doing so many other things, but i have no motivation to do them. i am sort of irritable towards my mom at ti ames. i guess that i could be bitter from the names she calls me asshole, bitch, cunt, fatass, lazy, failure . my mom and i get into bad arguments as as a result, but not often. during those moments when they get really bad, i feel like i do not want to be here.	moderate
blocking out memories i think that i have had some form of depression for atleast years now, i say some because its changed into different things over the years. there were these ti ames where it was like the logic in my thinking was corrupt and i could not reason just why , about anything, if that makes sense. the only thing i found to do was just block it all out forget and just dont think about it. i kept a diary of such ti ames because i did not want to forget. flash foreward to a month or so ago when i open this diary that i promised myself i was not going to open until i was sure, and upon reading it i realized that i would forgotten most of my memories, my childhood, and the person i was. whack.	moderate

life goes on. hello everyone from r depression. i wish you all good vibes. it is always hard to write a text where we are venting, where we are expressing ourselves, especially if we are in a fragile state, emotionally, physically and when we read it after one day or two we might think it was weird, it was dumb to write, but oh well, we wrote it, it was what we were feeling and as such it is a valid thing, it is valid for us to vent, express ourselves. well, moving on, honestly, my life is not bad, i do not think so, i have one or two good friends, my family likes me and supports me, i am healthy, i am studying. seems normal, seems good. and i have to say i am much better than when i was before, undoubtedly. but i sti will feel bad. i am horrible at making friends, every friend i had was because they approached me first. i have not made a new friend in years, and i have tried, it just never gets anywhere. probably because i am boring, because i am not very good at talking, who knows, everyone is free to not talk, and i respect that. i have zero friends in university, my class is entirely made of girls, and while they are nice and fun, it is really hard for me to talk to them. i want to, but the anxiety of saying something bad, or boring, just completely fi wills me up. i can live with almost no friends though, it is fine to me, i had more friends but a bad period of months made me push them away. i am sti will angry, sad, lost because i lost my best friend, girlfriend i guess, some ti ame ago. it was a bad breakup, but honestly my fault. i should have tried harder in the relationship, i did not, and that is that. the past is in the past, but it sti will hurts me. i honestly just feel alone, even though i have my family and friends. i dont really like living. i have things that i like doing and make me happy, and make me laugh and i like being with my friends, i like cooking, playing, spending ti ame with my family, but if i had the chance to just thissappear, i would. i have never tried suicide, do not think i wi will. but living is not really what i like. i have done a lot of different things, i have my hobbies, i have traveled, i have laughed with friends, go out with them, and sti will, i return home and while i liked it, i would die. i am not expecting anyone to read this, or comment on this, honestly i think many people write here just to vent, somewhere where others are feeling the same.	moderate
 work from home so you ll be safe. let me start by saying this post is not to slam anyone who is stuck in their homes either by choice or not. there is too much of this going on in this subreddit and that is a whole rant i wi will save for another day because it is honestly ticking me off. what i am going to bitch about though are people, especially the government telling me to work from home to contain the virus. i currently live in nyc which is in full blown hysteria right now. well guess what? i do not have the option to do so and tons of other people do not. it is easy to do that when you have a real career that allows you to work remotely, but if you re in a shitty, barely above mini amum wage at best job like the rest of us, we si amply can not. we re putting ourselves at risk constantly because we can not afford to lose out on even a day of pay and we re lucky if we even get vacation days at all! not everyone has the luxury of doing this and i can guarantee that the people getting sick are mainly the working class people. this shit is getting depressing and i feel even more like a loser for not having a real career than i did before.	moderate

lifelong depression i am a year old girl with chronic severe depression. i started writing suicide letters when i was in broken crayons. i remember yelling at myself in my head for not being able to make a pretty spiral on the sidewalk with my chalk set, and i always felt like i deserved the scrapes i would get on my fingers from the pavement because my chalk spirals weren t as pretty as my babysitter s. at years old i had a lot of meltdowns about being a burden to my parents, and an annoying friend. this is sti will a very big thing for me. i moved from oregon to i willinois almost years ago now and i hate it here. i recently lost all of my friends due to my best friend who turned out to only hang out with me out of pity. i never saw it coming. he was always so kind to me and i would remind hi am that he should be honest with me about our friendship and tell me if there was ever anything i could i amprove on. he never did. he left me out of the blue without any explanation of why, and i spiraled into further self loathing about how i was a mess up in every aspect. i was hospitalized a few weeks later. nothing helped. i feel even more like i should bottle things up and find a way to end it all so i do not burden anyone ever again. i do not know what to do anymore.	moderate
depression made me the monster i was always afraid of becoming and i did not even know it until it was too late. just in january i finally moved out of a toxic and abusive home. i finally started a job that i was proud of and happy with. i sti will had one of the most amazing, loving pets in my life. in february, the company let go of my whole department. in march, i finally had to put my childhood pest friend tiger to rest. this week, i started a new job and i have stopped crying mornings and nights because the pay is awful and the workload is i ammense and no other jobs i have applied to have reached back out. now, i am going to lose my apartment because i can not afford it. today, my manager at my second job said she is considering closing up for a few weeks and i literally rely on that paycheck to pay for my car. less than days, my life has turned upside down. i got so depressed and got so drunk from gin at a d amp d session that i threatened to harm or ki will my self in front of my party and i do not even remember. and you know what is scary? i wished i would have done something about it later when i was not in my right mind to think about it. today sitting in the shower i realized that i have become the one thing i was always afraid of toxic. my mental health has deteriorated past the point of salvaging. i had not noticed how nasty, rude, thissociative, and standoffish i have been to people until i realized that one text from my mother nearly sent me off the deep end of packing my bags tonight and leaving to go camp alone or just go to the beach and drown. what the fuck? who fucking does that? i randomly deactivate my social media accounts just to see who would notice. i try listening to my therapist but things she says makes me so mad or make me realize things that are so out of control in my life that i just give up and sink down into nothing instead of trying to fix it but also what is the point? i have come home every day to lie in bed and watch videos until i sleep. i nearly broke down crying in the grocery store today from how overwhelmed i was and the intrusive thoughts in my head are growing worse and worse and worse. i am a failure. the world is literally ending. none of the mental health methods i have tried have been successful at helping me. i just get worse every year. i do not contribute to society in any healthy way. even my physical body is shit and iv been in and out of doctors office and hospitals for the amount of pain i am in regularly with no answers. i just want it to stop.	moderate

what is he was right? on mobile so bare with me. when i m was in high school i struggled a lot in school. i loved learning but hate the structure of school. teachers did not seem to care i was struggling and my friends sure did not as they all abandoned me. it got to a point where i was so far behind i was not on course to graduate. enter my counselor. he called me into his office one day to notify me i was going to graduate. i explained i did not enjoy school and how it was hard for me to follow along someti ames. he looked back through my recorded and said it looks like i have not been doing well in school for awhile and i agreed. i wi will never forget what he said next. i have felt with losers like you before. you might as well drop out as you ll never amount to anything in life. he said it so matter of fact that it took a second to realize what was just said. i was speechless. i gathered my thing and went home. i told my parents and my mother went to school to talk with hi am. she came back a hour or so later and told me i was dropping out of school. apparently he convinced her it was the best thing and she agreed. she told hi am and the vice principle off and that was that. later i got my ged and tried to live a normal life but that counselors words have stuck with me. what if he was right? i am single, broke, stuck in a dead end job and work way to much. i hardly have friends as i have a hard ti ame letting people close to me. he was not the last person to call me worthless and a loser. what if they have all he right? i have tried to better myself but i feel like a wasted life. like a chunk of flesh going about the motions of life with no joy or happiness. i lay awake at night replaying that day. hearing those words and i think i might be starting to believe them. maybe he was right.	moderate

not eating i have never starved myself like this. i have had ti ames in depressive episodes when i ate less or nothing for a day what was considered a normal symptom but never for multiple days in a row. and i do not know what to do. i do not want to eat anything anymore. i could easily just order pizza or anything but i do not. i open the app like ti ames a day but instantly close it again. even drinking is hard. i just do not want to. and i do not know why. have not eaten since wednesday thursday a few pizza rolls and nuggets someone brought me . but i have not eaten days before that either. i am so wasted going to the bathroom is a challenge. i can not walk right anymore and almost pass out when getting up. this is just a part of my problem. there is way more and way too much not minding corona. do not care too much about that. i am taking care but that is it . and i wanted to meet w a girl from school this weekend she is one of two persons i feel comfortable talking to about my problems . i would get something to eat then cause she does eat cause she is sane and probably force me to eat too. what is a good thing. but cause of corona her parents prohibited her to go out for a whole week. what is pointless as the virus would not be gone in a week. it wi will be only be spread more... . so now i am totally alone. got nobody to talk and do not eat. i do not know what i want tbh. but do not tell me that things wi will get better or anything like that. you do not know me and what i am and have been going through. but i would appreciate advice or something. if you have been through something si amilar maybe what helped you eat and stuff. i just do not know what to do.	moderate

last summer last summer i went to a local lake with some friends after we took our final exam for the year. i probably should not have gone as i can not swi am, but it felt good to be included for once as i am almost never invited to hang out with them after school. we messed around in the water for a bit, but then they wanted to go onto the diving platform that was on the other side of the buoys and jump off it. after doing that, they convinced me that they could get me over the buoys and to the platform despite the fact that that area was too deep for me just to stand in, so needless to say things went awry. i had pretty quickly gotten caught in the buoys and had begun to sink while flailing my arms around trying to grab hold onto anything to make me feel secure. and for a second or two, i stopped fighting and enjoyed the feeling of being in the water, i think i even accepted my possible death, maybe even welcomed it. but then they managed to get me back up and over to the safe side. now i find myself thinking about that day. how much better it would be if i just gave in sooner. how much happier everyone else would be. how much easier it would be. i wish i had drowned. i should have drowned. i should have tried to drown. the more i think about it the more i think that the next ti ame something like this happens, i wi will just give in. no hesitation. and i can not tell if that scares me or not.	moderate
i just started to write a suicide note. might be worth a read now, first i want to clarify, that i have no intention of going through with anything. i have been super severely depressed, for a long ti ame now. around years. that is around the ti ame i got out of jail, had my own place, good job, a good group of good friends. i might want to add that prior to going to jail i was in a relationship that destroyed me completly and had i had the means to do so, would have taken my life anyways, life was really great. and then i started using heroin. i am soon. i was, at the ti ame. anyways, things went downhi will really quickly as i overdosed not long after getting into it. did that for a couple months, like or , and i got a wake up call super long story, there is so many things i wi will have to leave out of this post so i can save some ti ame but, i ended quitting cold turkey. and shortly after went on a week binge, ended up crashing my car almost ki willing myself and my friends. i blacked out behind the wheel fast forward a little, years ago, from present day, i met a girl. and we had a vibe like i have never vibed with a girl before. it ended up being a mistake. and pretty much ever since then, i find little to no enjoyment in my life. i hate myself. everything i have done, people, and family i have hurt. there is so much regret and guilt, pain and sorrow. everything is become stagnant. and i do not think i can ever get out of the rut that i am in. i barely go outside, or go anywhere really. i do not talk to people much, and i barely see my friends or family anymore. i just stopped leaving my house i feel thisconnected from this world. from all of the people. the only reason i am sti will around is because i know what it would do to my family if i were to take my own life. because the thought of that brings me enough pain, that the pain that makes me want to die becomes irrelevant. starting to write a suicide note, was a decision i made in order to vent. but, to actually dig into everything that is deep inside. everything i have buried over the years. all the secrets. everything. i got quite a lot of it written actually. and it felt good to release all of what i held inside. i think that was the first ti ame i have actually cried since before going to jail, years ago. in the note, i came to realizations, about myself, and my life. my place in my life. the places that i do belong. i was scrolling through this subreddit and to see everyone, all the people that have alot of the same feelings as me, it makes me so sad. i wish i could help all of you, i hope this post helps alot of you. here is something i wrote in my note maybe i am just stuck in a loop. searching for answers i wi will never find, to questions i wi will never know. obviously this is a paradox. but i feel like it describes so much. to me, it is like a state of nothingness. a place where even i do not exist. and i just want to say, to whoever might be reading this. please, do not hurt yourself. i understand the pain, the suffering. having nothing left. all of it. i get it. but, stay alive. stay alive for you. even if you feel like you re not even worth that. do it harder. for the past you s. and the future you. always here if you need someone to lend an ear. thank you for reading.	moderate

failures, failures, failures okay, so, this needs a bit of background to set it up first, so i wi will give it my all. september of last year, i moved into this neighborhood. my girlfriend had just broken up with me, so i was not depressed, only depressed . i am almost years old now, btw, which makes this story all the more harder to tell. but anyhow, i hung out with this girl in the neighborhood, and soon, i asked her out. late october, she moved out, and i had no idea about it until they were long gone. we d either meet up in the woods, somewhere in the neighborhood, or my house, never her s. she did not even say goodbye, i was destroyed when i heard about it. but this is not all. i actually fell into depression when the next door neighbor kid, my only friend anymore, said that we could not hang out anymore, of which the reasons are beyond me. late december, another girl moved in. i hung out with her for a bit, then she asked me out. this definitely lightened my depression, but not all of it. it was early january when she broke up with me by these exact words, you thisgusting, conspiracist hob goblin! get off of my porch, you vile creature, i do not ever want to see that face ever again! i was so completely devastated that i cried the rest of that day and through the night. i would ignore my parents. i would ignore my few school friends and teachers. this caused my grades to fall, causing constant harassment of my family and teachers, and a huge loss of friends. in late january, she came to my house with a silver ring, a raven. she apologized for her nasty behavior, and we talked for a while. my parents were out of town, so we went back to my house. we chatted, then we, uh... uhhhhhhh, this is kinda hard for me	moderate

i am only and my mom is dying of brain cancer, my girlfriend just broke up with me while i am away taking care of my mom. i just do not know what to do. sorry if it is a long and shit read, i just need some help so a month ago i got a call from my mom, she told me she has stage four brain cancer and has about months to live. i was living on the other side of the country so i moved back to take care of her. i have barely been able to handle that. i take care of her , and it is rough. i do everything around the house, i do everything to take care of her, she does not want any social workers or support so i get to deal with that. it is fucking hard, i do not know what the fuck i am doing. i have been trying to do my best, but it is a struggle to find the motivation and to try and be happy around her. i am tryn then tonight my girlfriend of years breaks up with me. it just really fucking hurts. i am sti will in shock and i do not think i have realized yet, but i am fucking broken. she is blocked me on everything. she sent me a video of her throwing the ring i got her into the ocean and told me to not even think about getting my stuff back. when she called me she told me to think of all the guys she going to fuck tonight because she is going to a party. so that just kinda haunts me. it was not a great relationship but i i just really needed her, i really did not need this to happen right now, but i fucked up so bad. i had this coming, but i was too fucking stupid and fucked it all up. i feel like such a failure and a pathetic loser for doing this. i do not even know why i did it. i just do not fucking know. i am fucking broken because of this, and i know i am not going to get her back. i just do not know how i am going to deal with this and my moms death at the same ti ame. i smoked a fuck ton of weed, but even that is not helping. i do not want my mom seeing me like this, but i just do not know what i can do. i just need someone to talk to but i have zero fucking friends, i have got my two brothers and my mom who is about to die. i do not know how i am going to get through this alone, and idk how the fuck to make friends. so i am just fucked. uh	moderate
i think a tornado might have cured my depression. around the past months or so i had been battling depression i had lack of motivation, losing weight due to not eating, grades suffered, etc. my house was one of many that were destroyed in the nashvi wille tornado outbreak on march . i was i side the house as i watched my roof being ripped off and felt the lift from the tornado, but oddly, i was not afraid. i thought to myself, this is the end, i truly accepted and even embraced death. i kept telling my mom i loved her. but miraculously my family and i survived. here is the kicker, since the tornado happened i have been eating more, feeling motivated, all that... it makes no sense... i had legiti amately accepted death and thought i was going to die, but the past days i have only felt a small part of my previously, in my opinion, heavy depression. thoughts?	moderate

i do not think i am cut out for adult life in this world i am currently a year old student studying the health side of biological sciences i do not want to say exactly what as there is not many on my course and do not only one with my name and i am paranoid a professor wi will recognize me lol ... i had an interview for a placement year today at a world leading organisation and it went pretty well and i was fine, but then i got home after a hour train ride and skip forward to now and it is am which is not late for me as i just do not sleep at night and i am just completely anxious. there was nothing to put me off the organisation earlier, it seemed bri williant but i am hoping they phone and say i am not really what they are looking for... why? because i just do not think i am suited for adult life or anything really, i just do not think i can do it. i am not lazy at all but i just can not ever see myself getting a job and working hours a week, especially in my area of expertise, yeah i am good at it and knowledgeable on the areas involved and i like it but i can not see myself doing it for hours a week every week for years. i would much rather actually do a menial job such as my old part ti ame job stacking shelves, a job where thinking is not required and i can just stand there and do a repetitive task all day and be off in my own world. but ideally i wouldn t have a job at all and i would live in a small hut in the woods or on a farm or even on a boat somewhere away from the troubles of real life somewhere where you do not have to worry. i just do not see the point in spending your whole life working to just die someday and it all be meaningless and your forgotten there just is no point i do not even want to complete this shitty degree but i am in too deep it is already been years it is to late to leave now and it would thisappoint my family, the only reason i do anything these days is to avoid thisappointing other people. i have always been an inherently sad and pessi amistic person but now i just do not think there is anything but pessi amism left. i do not even know why i am writing this shit to be honest no one is going to read this much writing it is more for me really, it is something to do other than talk to myself in the mirror you know what is tragic too? i would rather be depressed than go to the doctors because a prescription would cost pounds a month and i do not think it is worth it and i can not really afford it either to be honest, but i can not get it for free because i do not fall into that bracket. my lack of motivation due to the fact we all die anyway is not helped by the fact that i do not think i wi will live past and am always diagnosing myself with new conditions currently a brain tumour, last week it was kidney failure so i figure if i have only got years to live what am i doing here wasting ti ame, i feel like my life has not even started yet i took mdma a couple of months ago and just sat in my flat and it was the best experience of my life but my anxiety stops me doing it again because i am convinced i wi will die if i do so that is fun i am really sorry if anyone has actually read this random rambling, sorry for wasting what little ti ame you have tldr we all die in the end so what is the point in doing shitty jobs and shitty university when it is just making you miserable and i would rather just live on a boat and travel around ai amlessly and be alone	moderate

i am having a pretty rough night i do not know what i need, i usually do not reach out for support because i was raised that men do not show emotion ever but ever since i woke up i have been on the verge of a panic attack. i tried to watch some youtube and play video games but it is not helping, i talked to my parents and told them i am on the verge of giving up, we talked for well over an hour and i sti will feel like i should just end this shit. i got myself caught in the system, i was a heavy weed smoker and one night picked up grams and pain pi wills so i could relax for the night. i was not addicted to pain pi wills because i have been down that road, went to rehab ti will they accused me of shooting up my suboxone when i was motherfucking months sober, my parents know needles are one of my biggest fears but i was so thistant and drugged out that they even sided with the doctor ti will i proved my point that i was being accused of straight up bs. when i got caught with the weed and pi wills i was sober and the cop accused me of being high so now i have to fight a fucking dui when i was not even high. i feel like i could save a lot of ti ame and money by ending this shit, i want to stay alive for my mom my dad my grandma and my pup but it is to the point i am feeling like i am starting to lose touch with reality, i started seeing patterns on the carpet when i stare at it for too long and even going almost a month without smoking and i sti will can not stop thinking about it. i can not sleep without benedryl or melatonin and i li amit myself to only getting drunk every other night. i am sick of this shit, my parents would not let me leave the house and go for a drive to clear my head so i barely even get sunlight which i feel is making me even more depressed. i have had thoughts about self harming the last two nights just so i can feel something. i do not know what to do, i am seeing a psychologist next week to hopefully get medicine to balance me out but i am honestly sick of trying, it feels like everyti ame i start doing better i am back to square one. i am at the point where i feel like ending everything because whatever happens when we die would be a better alternative to this. i feel like a prisoner in my own mind, my own house, i can not do a fucking thing. my lawyer said the charges i got were bs and he can probably get them dropped but i sti will get treated like a cri aminal. my parents want me to start going to bed on a normal sleep schedule but i do not want to be awake, i usually sleep at am and try to sleep the day away. my parents are working with me and want to help, i said i want to look into a service dog so when i am on the verge of a panic attack like this i would have something to keep me calm and help me out but they said you ll get a service greyhound a fucking hyper, tiny, greyhound. i have a greyhound now and he does not want anything to do with me unless i have food or pet hi am. i really want a golden retriever since i have worked with a few and they are the kindest little pups ever but it feels like nobody gives a shit what i want or need.	moderate
struggling student, grief, and now i can not the help i need because my university health counseling center is closed. hi, all. so, in case you could not tell, i am struggling. a lot. f so, this semester has been rough. i am failing and doing poorly in my classes, which i normally do not do. i am incredibly upset and thisappointed in myself because i am set to graduate in the fall, and i am worried that i would not be able to. i just do not want to be a thisappointment. while i am doing better today, i have had a rough ti ame grieving the loss of a prominent figure in my life to suicide. it is made me quite sad, and i can not seem to stop thinking about it. i went to my university is nursing center, and we had an appointment scheduled today to thiscuss medication options and counseling options for severe depression anxiety symptoms. our campus closed due to the virus pandemic, so i can not get the help i need. i am too worried to seek help when i get home my mom has typically tried to keep me from medicine for mental health because she thinks i do not need it. i am just really struggling, and the thought of having to go home and pretend like i am doing great in school and emotionally is so stressful. i also plan on staying with my fianc this upcoming week. i am so ready to see hi am, but i also do not want to be a downer the whole ti ame i am with hi am. i guess everything in the world is just overwhelming. i am also a music major, and my senior voice recital that was scheduled for tuesday was cancelled, in addition to my other choir performances and music fraternity events, and it is been quite a shock to my system. i hate that my mental state has made me struggle to enjoy making music, and now i am sad to know that i may not get to perform with my ensembles for the rest of the semester, and i am not sure if i wi will be able to have a recital. my birthday is tuesday too, and i feel like i would not even be able to enjoy it. i am sorry if this was a lot, or if it seems like i am being negative over small things. thank you for reading if you have made it this far.	moderate

how do i take my mind off of job searching? i am getting so tired of unemployment. it is vicious, because there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. plenty of jobs out there, i would love to do, but they would not even consider me, because i am fresh out of college and do not have much experience. i have worked my ass off for years sacrificing days, nights, weekends, sleep, my sanity. i am at the point where i am going after jobs requiring a high school diploma. and yet, they sti will want tons of experience. how do you even get experience when everything requires experience? i just do not even know what to do anymore beside sit in a corner and cry.	moderate

easier to lie i am exhausted from telling the truth. telling what i really feel and what i am going through. how difficult it is. how lonely it is someti ame. i keep telling myself that sharing to those who i trust is a good thing but it is not. all those words, promises, from others are just lies. they wi will forget their own words and wi will just hurt you again and again. i know everyone is tired. i know everyone is stressed. how is it that i can not feel tired when everyone can? i did not ask for this kind of mental state. i did not want to be in this mental state. i guess it is easier to lie saying i am fine, or making myself look happy. it is easier to fake your happiness than to be truthful of what pains you. i have probably vented too much on this subreddit and i think i should just keep myself quiet from now on. it is difficult and probably i ampossible but i really do hope everyone of you wi will have a good day, one day.	moderate

first and last post i do not know if i am feeling depression or if something deep inside of me just craves the attention i have never received before, but i just need to vent. since the age of my mother would work hour shifts every single day and the only other people who could take care of me were abusive. my brother would physically assault me with punches and with finger penetration of my rectum, and when i was left alone with my sister she would lock me in the closet so that she could go out with her friends and my mother would arrive at am with me soiled and scared in the closet. i promised myself to never allow myself to be that weak again so i thistanced myself from everybody to better myself. as i grew my family became closer to god, but quite the opposite happened to me. i did not feel that a god could exist that would allow kids to go through such hardships. they constantly tried to apologize for their behavior, but it is just things that i wi will never forget, they ruined my perspective on life and completely ruined any future relationships i would have with people. throughout high school i made my family very aware that i would leave the very first opportunity i received because i did not feel comfortable around them. i signed a contract to join the military when i was , but before i left i managed to get my first ever girlfriend. amazing girl, great heart and beautiful as can be. she instantly made me regret signing my contract, but the deed had been done. i left to basic training on the month of my th birthday, and although leaving my new love was very hard, i was ecstatic to be away from such a toxic family. throughout basic training i would stay up past lights out just to write her a letter and a poem every night, at that ti ame i knew i would marry this girl. i know so cliche to marry your first love in the military i would go visit this girl every months, and i ended up getting her pregnant on one of these trips back home, unfortunately for us, i was and she was . we wanted to wait for her to turn before we involved the government in any type of family movement, but once she turned of age it was too late to try to get her to live with me. i was doing an overseas tour and i was told to wait for my tour to be over. i missed a year and a half of my sons life, and throughout my tour i felt like an empty shell. i would talk to nobody, i wouldn t eat, i wouldn t exercise. i would just work and go home. maybe it was the thistance, or maybe it was all my emotional issues getting in the way, but my feelings for this girl weren t the same, and i felt like the only thing saving me from doing anything stupid to myself was the fact that i had my baby boy waiting for me at home. i just got home last week, and this boy is amazing. he makes me feel like i have never felt before, but every now and then there is just a switch in my head that reminds me that i am just living a lie. even then i would never leave hi am, i just could not. i wouldn t let hi am be raised without a father like i was. his mom is amazing and we re sti will together, and i feel like it is my fault for not telling her about my mental state, but she is not the most supportive person in the world when it comes to my emotions. it is just really hard to explain to her how i am feeling because most of the ti ame i do not even know how i am feeling. today she playfully touched my rectum even though i have told her plenty of ti ames that i do not like that, and i just got furious and upset because it reminded me of my past experiences and i almost broke down. i later brushed it off as if it were nothing, but i feel like there should be no reason for me to justify something i have told her not to do. she then pulled an innocent cheating prank on me on the span of hours that really got me upset so we both went to separate rooms to cool off. i was over it so i walked into the room with our kid ready to make amends before all hell broke loose. mind you, i just landed from europe days ago and i am sti will a bit jet lagged so i was really looking to take a nap, but as soon as i stepped in she asked me why i brought my son in if he was not ready to go to sleep, he sti will wanted to sleep. i told her to take hi am out if she would like to because i was very tired, and she just angrily stormed out reminding me how useless i am for not taking care of my kid. i have not had the practice of being a dad and i completely agree with her statement, i just feel like a piece of shit. someti ames i just feel like it would be better for my son to just get a cut of my life insurance instead of having me around and just get all of this over with. i am just not made for this and i really just feel like there is nothing i can provide for my sons future. i am sorry that this is just a long run on sentence with not a lot of details, but i just needed to vent to somebody. anybody. thanks for reading, but i would not be replying to this. hopefully the rest of you are not as stubborn as me. reach out for help	moderate

everything just dollars ing sucks ... i am years old. from the ti ame i was able to remember until this very second, i have always been taunted and made fun of. being asian american and born and raised in a predominantly white neighborhood, i was always stuck out like a sore thumb. no one ever had any faith in me. everyone always had negative criticism. my family always thought of me as a failure, and it all caused me to have the lowest self esteem i amaginable. life was not ever easy. being sad at all ti ames i am awake, i have to keep my mind occupied and thistracted by video games or movies or television so i do not think about how much i have not accomplished anything in life. only when i sleep do i get to escape reality and dive into the nothingness, but with all the anxiety i can not sleep without taking a bunch of zzzquil or unless my body and mind are just to exhausted to keep my eyes open. no one understands the pain i am suffering, and they want to push their agenda on me. they do not understand that i have been conditioned to only know failure. they do not understand that i wi will never become successful at anything i try to do in life. they just think i am not trying hard enough, but every ti ame i have ever tried at anything, i have only been rejected and condescended. i am just so done with all the mess. i do what i can to survive. i can not take any more. i am so sick and tired of it all. i just want to thisappear. i just wish everything would end. i wish god would strike me with lightning and just let me go. i am sick of living. i hate the world. i hate humanity. everyday, all i encounter is stupidity and morons.	moderate

why???????????????? i was going through some photos on my laptop tonight and came across some that were old and i did not expect to see and it made me so very sad. some were of my mom, who died last april. some of my youngest daughter who i have not been close to for the last few years and barely speak to. my dad, who has had cancer and been in hospice but chose a low life loser over his own family. it breaks my heart in a way i could never explain in words here or anywhere else. why did it come to this? how? i need answers and nowhere to turn. i have become so depressed the last few years that i only feel like my life is sinking further into a dark abyss of nothingness. i feel all alone despite having my boyfriend around . he only really seems to care for hi amself most the ti ame and my feelings and needs do not seem to matter. more less the fact i am upset and depressed about my losses and past. i keep praying to god but i am really starting to question if a god exists because if one does, i am not seeing or feeling it. i have never felt more alone, destitute and abandoned in my entire life. i keep thinking of who i can turn to and the same answer keeps coming back to me nobody. not one single person do i really have to truly confide in or share my deep loneliness. i have my cat. she loves me and i love her. but obviously i can not talk to her. i just want this nightmare to be over. surely this is not what life is all about. there has got to be more to it than this. please someone tell me there is more to it than this. even if you re just telling me to make me feel better. please. i need something right now.	moderate
the rabbit hole i am just trying to get this out of my chest so maybe i can get some sleep tonight but... the rabbit hole sucks. i always feel at least a little depressed or anxious all the ti ame because of dumb hereditary hormonal nonsense i am just stuck with but it makes everything just so miserable... i know i am not alone and that others have it worse than me but that does not help. i constantly feel guilty for having depression despite my life being at least semi normal. every ti ame i feel depressed i feel guilty which makes me more depressed, then i try to do fun things but i usually do not enjoy them which makes me feel worse and more guilty for wasting ti ame, then i try to work to make up for it but it never feels like i work enough or do a good enough job which just tunnels me further down. then there is feeling suicidal... which i do a lot. i want to jump off a bridge, hang myself, walk in front of a car, anything to end the suffering but i know the people around me who love me would miss me but that just makes me feel more trapped and guilty... i feel like there is no escaping the pain and it feels so stupid because i should be happy or content, my friends and experiences should lift me up and make me feel grateful but all i feel is guilt, paranoia, and depression. i have tried everything, seeing a therapist, taking different kinds of meds, trying to fit up my diet, exercise, thistracting myself, every healthy and unhealthy coping mechanism out there just never seems to work. i feel awful because i am sure my friends are getting sick of me being this flip switch of shoulder to cry on and depressed mess but i am just.... stuck i guess. there is not much advice to give or whatever i just... i needed to get this out and at least here i would not necessarily be bothering anyone... at least i hope not. hope you guys are having a better night than i am.	moderate

what is the point? fuck man i do not know what to say, i just do not even see the point in anything. like why am i lying in bed at am, typing a post to strangers because i have nobody else, just to... vent i guess? i do not even know. what do i expect from this? we re all going to die someday and then that is it. a funeral maybe and then it wi will be like i never existed. i wi will never achieve anything of significance. i probably would not be alive to see what other life is out there. i am supposed to be in my best years. i am and have no fucking social life, no fucking job or education and nothing to look forward to. i have a suicide note saved in my notes app just in case. fun fact i wrote it on my th birthday, little over a year ago. i was in bed crying having a panic attack because i had to go to school. how pathetic i know. glad i left early because i really could not handle it. i got a job at a call centre but had to leave after a few months because anxiety, i could not handle it. i would cry in the bathroom everyday. this does not have any structure to it and i am sorry but i just want to vent. everyday is the same pretty much, when my sleeping pattern is good it helps but only barely. i wake up and play the same shitty game everyday, always alone and it is boring. i do not even get much joy from it but i sti will play. every now and then i go for a walk and if the weather is not god awful i wi will penny board along near the shitty beach. i only go at night because fuck social interaction. plus i can listen to music and quite often break down crying. i often think about jumping off the pier but i know it wouldn t ki will me, maybe just scare me straight or something. i love my family and my pets, they truthfully are the only thing i care about. my brother was is my best friend but he has a girlfriend now and i barely see hi am. now i am even lonelier and it fucking sucks so much. i hate how much of a thisappointment i must be to my parents. also realised on my th birthday i was an accident which kind of sucks. brother and sister are years older. i miss being young. i had friends, i was reasonably happy, although i have been pretty depressed for like years and it is getting worse. there are no jobs going where i am. so i am stuck in the house all fucking day and it gets real old, real fast. i want to live my life, be happy and successful but at the same ti ame i do not. i have posted on r lonely on an alt a couple ti ames but nobody replies. the irony. i do not know what to do. i want to try drugs, heard weed can help anxiety or make it worse. i just want to try them and experience something. i do not have any friends to ask so would anyone here recommend anything? if it is a bad idea then that is ok i am just curious. might make my hours of free ti ame everyday more interesting. also does anyone else listen to certain artists when they have going through a particularly bad patch? i vs noticed i do it recently. usually blink and lil peep for me but it changes. as for interests and hobbies, i love drawing but i do not have any supplies and i have no money or motivation. i like pc building but again i have no money. also my bed is so fucking shitty, theres no slats underneath it but theres wooden planks for a fence or something and the mattress is springs jag right into me it hurts, anyway, i enjoy looking after ani amals and i have a dog and a bird. both keep me company, i love my dog so fucking much, he is too pure for this shitty planet. i am going to finish it here, sorry for the formatting and structure or lack there of. if you read this all i appreciate you and have a good day night.	moderate

i can convince myself i am faking it if i think about it too much i have always had trouble feeling like i am faking my depression. if i think about it too hard, i forget reasons why i am depressed and can only conclude that i am doing it to myself for attention. if i am actively thinking about why i am sad, it is a lot easier to validate my emotions. but if i think about it too much, these things seem more insignifican not and i convince myself that i am not really depressed, i am just making myself feel that way for no reason for a couple of hours thisregarding the other symptoms like loss of interest, fatigue, etc . which, inevitably, makes me feel worse because i feel terrible and have no validation, not even any that i can give myself. i hate the way my brain operates.	moderate

i feel lonely, depressed, betrayed, and i think i am developing a drug addiction. sorry, this is a bit long. a while a go in my senior year at high school th grade , i was stabbed in the back by one of my long ti ame friends he told everyone in our circle including a girl i had a crush on that i had said something to hi am along the lines of i want to rape your year old sister , and without question, they all believed hi am. it did not help matters either that he had his rat fucking bastard cunt stain on the human race friend reinforcing that lie to everyone. they also used to call me a terrorist and a sand nigger because i am from iran. i constantly told them that i did not like this, but they continued to do it. then, all of a sudden i am the bad guy because i said something about his sister, which i never did. i would not go into detail about why i think he did this, but i think one of the reasons is he is sensitive about is his height. he tried to play it off as if he does not care, but he obviously does. i used to be the short kid of the group, but around i had a growth spurt and now i am . m, while he is stuck at . m or some shit like that, and every ti ame the topic of height came up, he would always say some bullshit like the measurement tape is off, you re actually . m or something like that, to which i always replied ok, buddy. whatever you say. before that ti ame i was occasionally smoking pot with a few of my other friends, but i started smoking more and more after this incident and started skipping classes to go cry in my car like a little pussy mostly because this cunt had ruined my chances with who i thought at the ti ame to be the most beautiful girl ever , and this pretty heavily i ampacted my grades. luckily, though, this happened in the final term of school, so my failing grades did not prevent me from getting into university. during holidays between high school and uni, i started dabbling in harder, more sedative drugs like valium and tramadol, because weed just was not cutting it for me anymore, and then i found heroin. i would heard about how dangerous heroin can be. how it can destroy lives and ruin you financially etc., but at that point my depression and loneliness was at it is peak, so i did not even care. i shot up for the first ti ame, and i felt fucking amazing. i was just in a euphoric dream for hours and i loved every microsecond of it. it just helped me escape from my horrible reality and experience joy for the first ti ame in a long ti ame. as of now, i am in university with zero friends, severely depressed, lonely and scared. i have always been very socially awkward and anxious, but now i have a newly formed thistrust of people, which is preventing me from making any new friends. heroin seems to be the only friend i have right now, and the only friend that i can trust to give me a good ti ame. i do not use it too much, though. probably only once or twice a week when i either come home from work or uni. my parents do not know about this though. i mean, they know about the incident at school but not about the heroin. i love my parents. i love them so much, so i do not want them to know. it wi will ruin them they wi will be more damaged from finding out i do heroin than someone who is using heroin. i someti ames go onto instagram or snapchat and i see that those cunts that did this to me are hanging out and seeming to have to best ti ames of they are lives, and i hate that. i hate them. i just hate that good for nothing waste of human life that did this to me. i wish hi am nothing but misery and pain for the rest of his miserable, wrenched life. i fucking hate his guts. i want that little fucking short midget piece of shit cunt to go rot away in a huge pile of cow shit where he belongs. i fucking want hi am to die a slow and horrible death, isolated from everyone, and hated by everyone. i hate hi am. i fucking hate hi am. i am not posting this here for you to tell me to go get help or go to rehab or anything like that, because i already know i can do that. in fact, i actually do not know why i am writing this post at all. maybe i am just venting, maybe not, idk. if you read this whole thing, thank you. just comment something to try and make me feel better please. i feel so terrible.	moderate

i serve no purpose. after graduating high school, i have spent three years in my parents house doing basically nothing. i had a job for about months but quit for a few reasons. i have nothing i want to do with money, working drains me, and the job sucked. i knew after i quit i would go back to doing nothing which is why i saved up money over that months so i could give money to my parents while i rot in my room indefinitely. this has been pushed as far as it can go however. my parents are at a crossroad because they want me to go work or go to school almost enough to force me, but they can not. they also know that if they kick me out i would accept it and ki will myself after leaving. i do not care about myself at all, i only care about my family. unfortunately that care does not goes so far that i wi will force myself to get a job or go study. the care just goes far enough that i wi will keep myself alive, and that is reinforced the feeling that the only reason i was born is to make people sad when i die. is there a path in life for people like me who would not do anything? i am an absolute selfish piece of shit and i regret being born every day.	moderate

i lost my entire identity tonight i grew up in a well off but dysfunctional household. depression flared up in my late teens. i am now. barely scraped by in undergrad in a major i despised but that my family pressured me in to. i have been working food service since i graduated years ago, barely scraping by. a year ago, i got into a halfway decent graduate program for english prose writing after spending years before that one studying hard and building up a portfolio. writing and ulti amately teaching it has always been my real passion, but was never something i was allowed to do by my family. i felt like i would finally made progress in my life, and that i would turned my life around. tonight, i went to a poetry reading hosted by some friends. i do not write poetry, but i went because my buddy and my girlfriend were performing. tonight, i learned that both of them are leagues better than i am at writing. their poetry is far, far better than any piece of prose i have ever shat out. my girlfriend, in particular, spent about hours writing a total of poems, with each one putting to shame pieces that i have spent months on. my entire identity is gone. two people who almost never write and who have never taken classes or studied it have blown absolutely everything that i have ever worked for completely out of the water. the one thing that i had to be proud of was blown out of the water by someone who, by her own admission, was not even trying. i do not think i can continue to date her. she was already better than me and most people at every single other thing she ever tried. she is a genius who effortlessly glides through everything she so much as considers attempting, and every second that i spend with her lately is a humiliating kick in the crotch that reminds me just what a worthless person i am. i want her to be with someone who is as talented and intrinsically good as she is, and i probably need to stay single forever. writing was the one thing i had to be proud of. the one single thing i could point to and say, hey, i worked for this, and something finally came of it! now my identity is gone, and i lost the one thing that i had. i am once again falling, falling, waiting to die. this is why i do not leave my house.	moderate
some changes bare with me here. negative talk incoming. so i am finally a part of a friend group. one of seven people...and the six others are paired together in three relationships so i am the only single one. sucks to suck i guess lol it is always something that makes me feel left out. i have never been in a relationship while they have all had their history of them. plus they have all known each other for far longer so they have deeper connections with each other than i wi will ever have with them. that just makes me overthink that they might talk about me behind my back that definitely is not unfamiliar territory. i do not know. i can not really see myself ever trusting people as much as i used to i always get let down or left behind. maybe i wi will just let myself be left behind this ti ame if things hint towards an unfortunate tapering off from those good feelings. i would not be surprised if i am ousted from the group within the next few months so i guess i wi will just enjoy the little things while i can.	moderate

coronavirus changed everything my mom is very controlling, paranoid, and manipulative. i am a freshman in college, and starting in the fall, i finally felt like i was free from her. after suffering in her house for years, i carved my path out. going back home for breaks kinda sucked, but it was not so bad. just a little bit and then i got to go back to school. throughout high school, i never really got involved with many extracurriculars except for theatre during my senior year. i continued doing it here at college, and this semester i was cast in an enormous and extremely exciting lead role. i have been practicing constantly. i wouldn t shut up about this play for weeks after i was cast. for once in my life, i had managed to make a big, close, reliable friend group in college. i got involved with multiple extracurriculars. i have been getting much better grades than i ever got in high school. i have been able to build my own life something my mom is not allowed to touch, for once. also, at school i was able to receive free and confidential counseling and psychiatry. i would not bother with details, but let us just say my mom does not really believe in that stuff. i had never been to a therapist before, but had struggled a lot with depression in high school. i now see how much therapy can help. then, i came home for spring break. i did not want to, but it was only a week. now, school is canceled the rest of the semester because of coronavirus. i just feel lost and empty. i feel like everything i have been working on has just thisappeared. i thought i finally made it out of this house and now i am back for at least a few months. possibly closer to six months if i can not get out of here for the summer. to make matters worse, my mom has now quarantined us. as in, no leaving the house. at all. for any reason. i have not breathed fresh air in a week. so that is where i am at. i feel hopeless. i feel like i went off and built this life for myself where i was independent and successful and opti amistic for the first ti ame in my entire life. and then i just got dragged backwards by something completely out of my control. i hope my feelings make sense. i am just searching for a reason to keep waking up in the morning. all of my usual reasons just went out the window.	moderate

crazy frightening experience hi all, so something happened to me a little while ago that has left me utterly rattled and had i had liquor in the house i would have necked the bottle. i was having lunch, oddly enough reading this sub, and i had a massive hit of deja vu of the worst things happening in my personal circumstance. i even txt d my counselor, as it was as if someone from the future downloaded memories into my mind. i could feel, see, hear everything. it was that brutally intense the physical response was nuts, a deep wave of depression, fear, anxiety, felt like a shot gun blast worse than i have felt recently honestly. it is passed now but i am sti will majorly rattled, my counselor says early day ad is can cause esp type feelings, but i used to get these as a child as well, but more so dreams. a very very thisturbing event. i suppose logically given my brain chemistry is being altered that is just it, but my god i hope it does not happen again. just wanted to share in case someone else has experienced si amilar. thank you for your ti ame.	moderate

just rambling this covid has put a lot of my life into perspective, weirdly just... writing to write. maybe someone wi will find something of what i say to ring true for them. idk i feel like an overwhelming sense of peace. like i am getting anxious, my thoughts are if i go i go, that is fine, but i want to be surrounded by family. but then i am worried about infecting them lol but i spent so much ti ame worrying and doing stupid shit and not taking full advantage of life it is not that it has motivated me to go out there and live my life to the fullest it is just kinda insti willed this peace, like, yeah, this is kinda just life. there are some good days, some bad days, and some ti ames you can not make the best of it you can try though, and i think opting not to ki will myself is my attempt however feeble at trying to live. i i amagined my life so so so differently and i am nowhere nowhere where i thought i would be. i achieved a lot in my life though, but sti will empty. hopefully, staying with family wi will help. i feel like i made a lot of bad decisions i made some good ones too i wonder what is next. i have a curiosity to see this to the end. i do have anxiety about getting my parents sick. but idk what would be worse, dying alone in a place i hate living bc of my own decisions , or dying surrounded by family, risking more death to be around them. i wi will have to see what they say haha they might be like no stay the fuck home lol. i am not sick or anything, i just read too much reddit. i am only but i feel someti ames like i am . i witnessed a lot. i had to grow up at age . some days i am just okay with dying. idk if it is typical to feel like that. i have a lot more thoughts in my head than i ever have. it is weird years ago, i was not like this. i was a firerocket of freedom and strength. i just kinda lost it over ti ame. i feel like i have experienced being so many different people. like who i was days ago is really really different than who i am today. months ago i was dating someone. months ago i was single and moved into a new house, to leave a few months later. months ago i lived in a different state. and so on. idk what to make of all of this. i get existential often and am learning what pulls me back into my body, slowly but surely. it is going to sound gross, but popping my zits actually is really meditative for me. i just focus on it and bc it hurts a little, i stop letting my mind run on and on. i got really sedentary over the last few years, i think it upticked my overthinking. i am not doing, running around, being active, just sitting and letting my thoughts pile on top of one another. i also run my own business where i am literally all positions, so i am in my head constantly. i also work remotely, so i also do not get any social ti ame. i am really curious how noticing these things and then going to fix them wi will help, maybe incrementally, maybe vastly. community friends, i have to go find them again. it is been a really lonely road, at first it is because i thought i was getting sober and needed to cocoon myself. but i am nearly years drug alcohol free and it is sti will lonely. i do not think that is right. i am definitely losing hope, it is weird to go through my high school years in my late s. i was always angry as a teenager but i was never depressed. i had so much going on, i was on a team sport that i excelled at, i had tons of friends, my family fought a lot but i did not have to worry about not eating or anything, and then, just, that is not my life anymore. i do not have control over my thoughts anymore. i can not walk away from situations without getting really emotional. that was never me, but it is who i became. idk if i like this version of me. maybe i am sti will becoming. maybe i wi will die in this misery. who knows? what i do know, is that i wi will go to sleep and wake up tomorrow and be a different person, again. thanks for reading	moderate

missing someone you know would not be in your life anymore i am fucking dying guys. is there a pain that is greater than missing someone you know you can not have in your life anymore? missing someone who you know does not give a single fuck about you? you ever cut someone off and the longer you go without contacting each other the deeper and stronger the realization gets that you ll probably never talk ever again? and that thought is terrifying and makes me panic because you can not i amagine wanting to live without them in your life. does he sti will have my number? did he change his? did he get a new phone and lost my contact info? does any of it matter when i know it is over? losing someone you loved so much and having them go from the person who knew you the best to a complete stranger as the months go by and you guys forget each other.... i am so scared. my heart is broken. does anyone have a fear of moving on? because nothing can replace those feelings you had when you had that person in your life. you might be replaceable to them but to you....they were everything. also, on an unrelated note...i have been self medicating. can someone please explain to me why xanax or xans as they call it, why are they so popular among young people? i am only but i do not get the hype. i have a whole bottle of a xanax prescription but every ti ame i take one i just feel drowsy and sedated and not in the fun kinda way . i am wondering how why these kids do it recreationally....i do not even get high off it	moderate

i am always miserable. it does not seem to matter what i do. i am always miserable. i hate everyone and everything, including myself. nothing is ever good enough for me. people make fun of me but i truly believe that they are the stupid ones. they have to be if they take satisfaction in their meager achievements. they are nobodys and someday they wi will die and leave no legacy, nothing of merit.	moderate
i can not laugh or cry literally. i am feeling like a weirdo. i can only smile, i can not laugh properly. i can only somewhat giggle for a sec or two. i feel like i have forgot how to laugh. whenever i laugh it feels like a made up laugh, it is like i am doing the i ampersonation of some character with a really deep voice. i feel so embarassed, that i just smile and i feel like i am intentionally closing my mouth while laughing. i also not cry properly. tears come into my eyes but i feel like i am closing my mouth intentionally to stop the voice from coming out. i want to but i can not. i started thistancing myself from my feeling because i was crying all the ti ame and was made fun of. and did not knew what to do. so i think years of thistancing myself from my feelings have finally made me a weirdo. the same reason i did all that was to avoid feeling like a weirdo ashamed all the ti ame.	moderate

the worst night in a while... i ache every night, due to loosing my family. both grandmas died when i was within months of each other. the only grandparent i know of is my grandfather who is a diagnosed psychotic, due to being screwed up in the military. the last thing i had that was comparable to a grandparent was my aunt. she died years ago, and i live in her house actually, i live in her room . it is really tough. i have told my parents about my depression, but i have been told that it is just a vice of satan. which, i can understand. however, it is very real, and i do not think god or any higher power would want us to feel this way. ive tried to shake this feeling, and it just results in classic symptoms thisorganization, not showering for days, not brushing hair teeth, not being able to get up out of bed, self loathing... i am not suicidal, i am just very, very sad. i have had quite an uphi will battle with my grandfather showing up at a significan not event in my life, that threw me for a loop mentally. i had not seen hi am in years. i was so little years when he last saw me. so it put me in an uncomfortable position between my parents and hi am. he left my grandmother after years of marriage, just to marry divorce more women. he ruined my grandmother and my mother. also, i have no friends, because everyone i befriend stabs me in the back. so, i am stuck in a place where i have my boyfriend which i am thankful for. i just feel bad for being so emotionally connected to hi am. granted we have been dating for almost three years, the poor guy has seen me deteriorate mentally. he is the only thing that makes me actually happy. i just feel bad for depending on hi am of the ti ame mentally, but luckily he is a good guy and does not take advantage of it. he understands to a degree. he just does not understand being in the position, because he has a healthy family dynamic. i am spiraling now...	moderate
i am so numb. my meds make it so i can function properly... for the most part. i sti will have trouble showering or brushing my teeth but i can at least go outside and do what i need to. but the numbness is just a softer depression. i sti will want to cry but much like before i can not let it out. it is so worthless, i am working towards nothing at all.	moderate
i feel like i do not belong, any advice? i know that a lot of people suffer from a lot of worse things, but i thought i could get this out of my chest. ever since i graduated from high school, i have been struggling to make new friends, my friends moved to another city to study and we eventually grew apart i only continue talking with one, but it is not the same . i spent my first semester of college all by myself, i tried to connect with others but they all knew each other from their high school i went to a different one . it was really hard to fit in, so i gave up trying and spent my ti ame reading alone. in my second semester, things got better, i got some friends and thought that they were going to be strong relationships. i am currently in my fourth semester, i sti will have them as friends, but i feel like i am only there to listen. every ti ame i try to say something i feel like i am saying something way out of place or si amply just not worthy of ti ame, like i am just squeezing myself in a group that is not my own i do not know if it makes sense . i sti will feel like i do not belong, even though i feel happy most of the ti ame, when i get home i feel like i could do something to change this, but i do not know what to do, any ideas? i would really appreciate any comment. thanks for reading my problem, even if it is not something so big. sorry if there is any misspelling, english is not my firsth language 	moderate

why am i depressed? i do not have a reason! my older sister by years has gone through a lot. my mom was at the ti ame that she gave birth to my sister and left my sister with others so that she could work and go back to school. we do not have the same dad. her father was abusive to my mom and she had to experience that first hand and she had to grow up faster than most children. i do not know a lot of the details because my mom and sister keep that a secret but i am sure it was traumatizing. my mom is not the most emotionally supportive, in fact she is emotionally abusive and she finds any little negative in every situation. i do not think she was always this way, i think she became this way after all the abuse from her ex husband. my mom ended up remarrying then had me. i have been really lucky to grow up with both parents in my life and while my dad has always been supportive, my mom sti will was emotionally abusive. compared to my sister i would say i am lucky to grow up the way i did. although i have experienced a lot of traumatic things myself and had to endure life growing up with medical conditions i think that my childhood growing up has been relatively better than my sisters. anyways, what i do not understand is how she meaning my sister lives. my sister has a reason to be depressed and i really do not yet here i am depressed. and i feel bad because whenever she reaches out to me and i tell her what is going on and she is so nice to me and encourages me to think positively yet i sti will find myself feeling worthless and like i am just trapped in this horrible life and way of thinking. i do not see a point in living and i really think everyone would just be better off without me yet why do i feel this way?	moderate

hi i honestly do not know where to begin, i wi will try to say what i want to say and not delete my own text, but i feel like i am super hard on myself. like i really want to just go to sleep forever and never wake up someti ames because i fucking despise my life, i have pushed away a girl who really loved me, i got cheated on one ti ame and felt like it was my fault. my best friend growing up died and instead of moving on i cut all my hair off and bottled it in not really telling anyone how i felt. all of my friends growing up have kinda cut me off because i am kind of weird now. i someti ames start hitting my head when it starts to ring because i feel like i am spinning when i am not and i just want to curl up in a ball and start crying but then i realize i would look so stupid so i just start scrolling through instagram again or watching another youtube video that does not really catch my attention but is merely background noise. idk whats going on i hurt everyday and it just sucks it sucks so much i just can not do this anymore and it hurts i want to cry rn but i am trying to type. i want to just be held but nobody wants to talk to me anymore, i do not even like having sex with girls anymore because i feel like they hate me, so now i have just been trying to be extra nice and careful but then none want to just hold me and tell me its ok. i have just been telling my parents i am ok just so they do not bombard me with questions and i just fucking can not, i am trying to type this out but i reread it and it sucks. sorry	moderate

does anyone else struggle with empathy? too much or too little? for a long ti ame now i have felt a sense of detachment from the people i know. there are probably only five people in my life that i consistently feel empathy for, otherwise it is like they are strangers. i feel callous and selfish but i always think that realistically they do not care about me either. it just feels performative when something bad happens and everyone reacts with horror just because it is what you should do. does the cousin i have seen once in the past year actually care about me? what about the brother i did not grow up with? why should i care about these people? why do not i feel anything for them? but then i consistently feel intense empathy for absolute strangers. i wi will watch the news and a brief mention of our local homeless population wi will bring tears to my eyes, or i wi will see a video on reddit of a man listening to his dead son is heartbeat and start openly crying. it is not just strangers either, i feel overly empathetic toward fictional people, too. i wi will feel gutted for days after i read or watch anything even a little sad. i feel like there is this persistent malaise in my life and i can not care about anything that is real. everything feels fake and it does not matter. the only thing that matters is the constant daydream.	moderate

these are just empty thoughts, it is am where i live...no sleep for the weak it seems like no matter how hard i try i always fall back into the pit. i may be younger than most, but i have been dealing with mental health issues my entire life. mental i willness defines me, i try to i amagine my life without any of it but i can not. i can not i amagine myself being happy or successful, feels like it was not meant to be. whenever i feel okay i know to expect a big crash later on. i am a pawn, i get used by everyone all the ti ame. my tolerance and acceptance of others is my biggest flaw. i hate that i am nice to those that do not deserve it, i hate that i am struggling to stay alive at an age that i should only be worrying about having boyfriends or what kind of clothes i like to wear. i wi will never get the opportunity to know who i really am because all these problems are drowning me and i can not swi am, no matter how dedicated i have been to learning. i have tried to break the cycle, refresh my mind and alter the chemicals in my head but someti ames it is just out of your control. nowadays i break easily i wi will have a suicidal episode around this ti ame on a weekday and i am just expected to attend class a few hours later. it is so unhealthy and i am not sure how much longer i can do it. other ti ames i feel the opposite i get hot flashes, my blood burns, pressure on the inside of my skull, everything is itchy and i want to break things. my intrusive thoughts tell me to stab myself and the people around me...scenes play in my head. i do not know what is wrong with me i am tired of my emotions fighting each other in general. if i am not numb i am feeling everything. i just want to be a kid, i never had a childhood. life is not fair, life is not enjoyable. i do not know what brings me joy. how wi will i choose a career? i am too crippled to be a productive member of society. the only reason i am here today is because of family, but they can not guilt me into staying forever. my suicide is inevitable, my death is inevitable, life has no meaning. we re just a clump of cells	moderate

my life is falling apart. i had a great job that i loved, the only problem is that it was in a country in europe, while i come from asia. i studied my master is in this country and got a job. i work in the charity sector. i lived there for years. in the meanwhile, i met the most amazing man ever, we got engaged last year in september. so to extend my work visa, the first condition was that i had to get a job that paid euros , a year. i got another job where i worked and i got the pay i needed. it seemed like the paper work for this permit was pretty straightforward. i fi willed out the form ti will the last section. it was about how this job was advertised. the charity that i worked in advertised it on their website. i applied for the job and had an interview and everything. i was not just given this job under any circumstances. i earned it. now, what the government wanted was this job to be advertised on very specific platforms like a national newspaper and radio for weeks and a website for job seekers to give them the best chance to apply for this job. i asked my workplace if they would be happy to advertise this job again, i would apply for it, or if they were happy to get in touch with the i ammigration department on my behalf since they are the biggest charity of that country and try to seek some help. they out right refused. i was given a letter that said that my job contract was only valid ti will because that is the day my visa expired as well. they would extend it if i got a valid visa extension. i went to a solicitor, he said that i would waste around euros on this visa application, there was only a chance that would get the visa, i would not get a refund on the application fees and the visa officers take this advertisement clause seriously and i do not meet the criteria. he asked me to get in touch with my workplace again and see if they are wi willing to advertise it again. they denied again. my fiance and i do not necessarily have the money to get married right now. it also does not feel right to get married just for a visa. i know it would be the easier way out but this is not why we want to get married. we decided to move to canada in . because he is from that european country, he is okay in terms of canada visas, he already got his visa. my visa to his country expired in december and i came back to my country after spending christmas with his family. it was one of the hardest things i have had to do, saying goodbye to my friends there, my colleagues and the beautiful home my fiance and i lived in together. i can not get over how unjust this was. i gave this charity everything i had for the last years and all fucking hr could say was we re so sorry. i came back home to asia, my life here is falling apart too. my parents have lived in a love less marriage for years now. they hate each other, each others families. my dad is been cheating on my mom for years now, we all know it. my mother has the darkest circles under her eyes and her health has degraded so much in the past few years, on the other hand my dad is progressing towards becoming a full blown alcoholic. they are finally separating. i am glad about it. they stayed together all this ti ame just to raise me and my brother and because of the what wi will people say mentality of the society we live in. my family is falling apart though, celebrating festivals wi will never be the same, my brother and i would not have one permanent home anymore, we ll always visit our parents separately. i also have to borrow some money from my father to take to canada because what i had saved is not enough. almost every day when my father is drinking, i hear hi am talk on the phone to his relatives or friends accusing me of how i have made hi am spend all this money, how he wi will never get it back, how i have made hi am a poor man. i have said it to hi am that i wi will start paying hi am back as soon as i start working. my fiance is also back in his home country, working and saving up for our move. he is a bri williant partner. he came to see me in my country for about weeks. he looks after me, knows what i am going through and he is always there to talk to me or just be sad with me. i do not mind the thistance between us, it is only for a few months. but i am hopeless about everything else in my life. we started to plan our wedding, we decided that we ll do it by the end of , after we have settled in canada with new jobs and everything. but no. i do not feel happy or excited about a single thing. i know that i should be grateful, i have my mom and my fiance and my best friend, i know they are always here for me but nothing is helpful. nothing at all. i do not see the light at the end of the tunnel. my career is in shambles, my parents are breaking up, my home is breaking up. my confidence, my happiness, my attitude, everything has been broken down in the past few months. there is something eating me up from the inside but i sti will do not feel like i can talk to anyone around me. i can not take it anymore. i have hurt myself in the past and it scares me how good it actually feels. i am trying not to do it again. all the things that i found happiness in before, i si amply do not now. just getting out of bed is the hardest thing to do. i try to sleep for most of the day, it makes it less painful. i do not know if i wi

i do not feel anything anymore. a while ago, it started. the comparisons were back. the backlash. the punishment. the lies. you re not good enough. i fought back. i tried so hard to fight back. i tried to hide, going to my friend is house, knowing they would use it against me at one point. at least i could say something. i had a voice. i could say what was wrong. i wish i gave you up when i had the chance. then i started to just stop. stop trying. to just exist. i did not feel any physical or mental pain. just this dark feeling is nothingness. you should be grateful you re sti will alive. i do not know how to describe it. i am not happy. sports do not help anymore. volleyball is not safe anymore. i have run out of tears. you re a fucking demon. i hate you. now i have just accepted it. i am not good enough. i am not good enough for the attention my friends give me that i crave so badly that i cry when they ask if i am okay. i am not good enough to invite with for plans. i am not good enough to be recognized for any work. you know how hard it is? to ignore the razor that i am itching to reach, but just knowing that it wi will make things worse if my parents find out? the fucking hell i wi will go through? not to heal, but to fucking hide the fact that i just wanted to feel something, anything. anything to just feel like maybe my soul is sti will here, that i am sti will here. but i can not. i know how worthless i am now. all my feelings are shattered. i am fucking broken. i can not feel anything else. i can not feel anything but how broken and empty i am. i am broken.	moderate
my stepmom is trying to make me homeless so, yesterday i accidentally read a text from my stepmom on my dads phone, and she was talking trash about me, saying it is ti ame i move out. i someti ames hear them talking about me at night when i get up to get a snack and it is usually about how bad my mental health is. i have some pretty bad anxiety issues so being kicked out wi will put that into overdrive, and with my asthma the anxiety attack wi will probably ki will me. i am scared, i can not bring it up cause my stepmom wi will use that against me and say i am an eavesdropping rat or something. my eyes are burning with tears and my heart is racing, i am trying so hard just to get by but every day is getting harder and the nights are getting longer. i do not know what to do or where to turn anymore.. maybe the world would be better off without me after all, i am just a waste of oxygen at this point	moderate
i am going to die and no one is going to care i am probably going to die by suicide and no one is going to notice or care. the main thing that prevents me from actually ki willing my self is i do not want to be even more of a burden, i do not want someone to haft to clean up my body but i am not sure how much longer this is going to stop me	moderate
welp.. i never really had a normal friendship or a girlfriend, had it good someti ames with family mostly bad though, since i was always the fuck up.. did not experience a lot. it sucks that i am going to miss out on all that. i hate to admit that i am depressed and lonely, i always denied it or tried to pay attention to something else but it was always underlying, and i would focus back on the emptiness. i guess i am letting it consume me	moderate
misunderstood i find this weird obession with artist that have passed away. it feels like i am looking for a message that i missed in their art or excistance. i often feel like they knew what the edge of life is, and that through their eyes i can know what its like to be alive. yet somehow i dont. i know that death wi will find me one day. yet i am not scared, its almost like a universal law. to me even if i lose against everyone ive ever known i know we are the same. the best way i could put it in my words is i amagine you re affraid of losing everything you have ever know, but everything you have ever know feels the same. fear is a powerful thing that makes many people act there worse but can you honestly blame them? i know that in the end we are all apart of the ani amal kingdom and it is a dog eat dog world but does it have to be? i mean we are not dogs and we clearly do not eat each other but does that mean we can not show faith and humilty to those who need it. i feel like all these poeple are screaming that pain can someti ames be forgotten, but pain is all they knew. their struggles or feelinges shoudn t be forgoten. the struggles of man are a vase and wonderful thing they can create and desytroy poeple. maybe i am just looking somewhere i shouldnt. i often feel like my heart is going to burst with the love that would have made them all right but i know that is not the kind of person i am. i know that these wrong doings and these terrible things lead them to be them, but somehow i wish i could change it all, i wish they could had the of love i had while growing up. that is when i typically realize they wouldnt be them with it. perhapse i am estranged because i can understand there pain even though i havent felt it, maybe i am just another goody two shoes looking for pain because that is what gets my rocks off but deep in my heart i feel like people deserved better. yet it feels so wrong to want better for someone else it seems like the only ti ame your allowed to put someones life above your own is by being an emergency doctor. it is like emotions and medical are all so seperated. like gettening better doesnt invovle being happieness yet i have felt so sick for so long. i just want this to end with i am not your savor i am not your solution i am just the same asshole listening to the same music behind another keyboard. maybe tomorrow the sun wi will rise in a smile.	moderate
depressed ever since my boyfriend fell off a cliff yes he survived. but we broke up and he doesnt want me back. i can not get rid of the memories of hi am in hospital and the separation anxiety is making me suicidal. my parents dont get why i am so upset and wi will not help me. but this is a cry for help	moderate
i am my i willness i am become nothing but my mental i willness. i hate and thisgust myself on every level. if i could erase myself then it would be to the net benefit to the lives of those around me, but i know that my death would deeply traumatise my kids etc. i feel so trapped. just want to remove myself from life entirely. feel this way all the ti ame to one degree or another, so very intensely right now though. do not reply, esp to say comforting nothings, i just need to say it somewhere. 	moderate
fear and pain are working both ways for me right now. i fear the next years in pain and alone. i fear death itself, one way into oblivion never to exist or know i existed. not knowing i was once alive. not having a thought. never to return forever. i fear messing it up and living the rest of my life in a worse physical state on top of my emotional pain. no matter how bad it gets. the first fear may drive me to want to die. but the second and third might keep me alive ti will it is ti ames turn to take me.	moderate
i can not fight for my life anymore i am dealing with a depression for months. idk why but i am felling like i am doing everything wrong and nobody loves me. i tried to ki will myself twice but it was not successful. nobody knows including my friends and family. i do not want to load them with my problems. to cry is not a solution anymore. i think if i am dying my family wi will be happier. they deserve a better child than i am. i have had enough hurting myself	moderate

somewhat of a weird thought thisturbs me i used to be a very happy kid male but that ended in , when i turned . i am always the one left behind, fat shamed, introvert, little thisappointing as a student. i, someti ames post hate replies just to feel better. the first ti ame, in , i knew something was wrong, when my grades were going down the drain. and then my dad started scolding me for small stuff such as not wanting to being able to talk to guests that visited. my dad was the best dad ti will , but then i guess someone in the clouds, flipped some switch and bam, things turned around overnight. now i survive just by talking to teens who reached out to me on thiscord to help me but they, and i know, noone else knows my problem. i take nostalgia deeply, music and old photos etc. i torture myself by not sleeping all night and planning suicides, but never having the courage to do it. my dad has never tried to take me to a psychologist or something, even though he knows he should, for sure. i produce music and i made a plan of how i would die, inspired by avicii . now i am stuck in a loop, because i know i do not want to live, but i can not have the courage to die.	moderate
why can not i feel anything? i am years old. i feel as if i am unable to be happy no matter where when how i try. i am so terrified of growing up! ive struggled with depression on and off in highschool. i had three great years before i graduated. now i feel like a lost little kid again. but this ti ame is different. ik i have people i can talk to about it. plz help. need someone to tell me its going to be ok	moderate
you better go on and love yourself no one needs you more than you! no one wi will be there more than you and no one wi will love you more than you you can have the whole world by your side, but at the end of the day, no one got you more than yourself make yourself, your own ride or die, because it really is the truth	moderate

my father cheated on my mother and i never wanted to accept reality so i si amply told my brain to forget it i never fully forgot it but i always wanted to forget it since i could not face my family with that fact. and it worked. but as things got worse and worse reality is catching up to me. my family is on the edge of a divorce and my mother does not even know about this. i am atm and i found out about it years ago. they all act like everything is ok but one small emotional outbreak could trigger a night long thiscussion. my father was acting different back then and i knew something was wrong. since my curiosity was so big as a kid i waited when everyone went to sleep and checked my fathers cellphone yea i know not the best thing to do . i found an dating app within it and a contact saved as x. i went through the messages, i do not remember what i read but what i know now is that he cheated on my mother. i never knew how to tell her and i fully knew that i could destroy my family with that. so i kept quiet. my family has achieved so much since the last years. we build a big house and made it somehow through a financial crisis. i always thought when i tell my family my future wi will be ruined. i always put me in front of everything. i did not want to lose my pathetic life what i have now. my room and my privacy is everything i have. it sounds like nothing but i lose everything if i tell them. in a matter of fact i do not care about my parents anymore. but i care about my little brother. he deserves parents and i think i could ruin his future too. this is going on since years and even when my emotions were boiling i never used my knowledge of that as an argument. i knew how to deescalate things. i do not know what to do anymore it is eating me up from the inside. i never told anyone about that but i have to share it somehow now	moderate
the last couple of days has been very dark for me. i can not necessarily explain the circumstances because it is too long of a story to tell...but i can say this, an aquintance of mine, that i have not spoken with for or years, that i often credit for helping changing my life for the better. seeing hi am be successful in life as well as with his friends and family, makes me angry at myself at the way i treated hi am, when i was around hi am. it also frustrates me because he was in contact with my aunt, who also helped me, who unfortunately passed away nearly years ago to the day . and frankly my relationships with of my family and friends reflects this. i hate my life, how i push people away, all because i have this subconscious fear of a someone hurting me. i honestly think that someti ames everything and everyone would be better off i had not existed.	moderate
someti ames i just feel like you fucking liying to myself i tell myself i am fine and i wi will heal ,maybe i do not want do die maybe i do not would not to live i tell myself i am ok but in ever moment of silence i know i am not i am just hide it i fucking hate lying yet i keep say i am fine it is not like i am purposely working myself to death or anything right? it is totally normal to go a month or so without a day off. i am not subconsciously trying to ki will myself slowly of exhaustion am i? fuck	moderate
i am done in a few months or so years of depression whilst having the perfect life i could ever ask for. well, not perfect but great. i am loved and have a great support system. i am taking meds and nothing is working. i do not think this life is for me. i feel like i am living in someone else is body because it seems like happiness is around me but it is like reaching for the sun. i wi will never get it. at this point, i am just taking up space. i am just making sure my dog wi will be well taken care of and going to start going through my stuff to see who would find it useful. i wi will be graduating engineering this may so i guess might as well finish it since i suffered in that major enough. but after that, i do not know how i am going to do it. i have different scenarios in my head but no concrete plans. i hope you all of you guys find happiness. you deserve it. love you all.	moderate
corona made it worse i am very sad about not going to school anymore. i am a senior so it is the last months of highschool for me and they got canceled. for a while now i have not been able to study for tests, books do not interest me anymore, i dont do art... i have no motivation whatsoever and if i have an idea that i am excited about i am sick of it after a couple minutes. life just does not have that shine it used to have. my future and present look dull. this entire situation of being stuck at home with no regular schedule is really fucked up and i hate it. i havent gone out of bed in hours and the tears have been rolling for days straight. i am afraid i wi will not see any friends or even my therapist. i know a lot of people are going through the same shit as me right now and some have it way worse than me with the financial situation and shit but i am sti will sad as fuck. i am afraid to fall into a depressive cycle and not come out of it. if any of y all can share your thoughts on the situation in general i would appreciate it 	moderate
feeling hopeless my husband and i have been fighting for days over stupid shit. i am on edge all the ti ame with hi am lately waiting for shit to happen. and if he doesnt start i do. i am not sleeping and i feel like shit. i have my defenses up and can not seem to lower it.	moderate
starting fresh i have had a lot of thoughts and shit go through my mind and i have been hiding a lot of shit and cuts from my parents which was making me feel shame on myself. so i have finally f k n just had enough, i can not live every day knowing that these thoughts could lead me to death or self torture, so... i want to try and start fresh, try and drop all my shit thoughts and try and be positive, it is going to be hard but i am having hope for the first ti ame in a while. i am hoping that trying to ignore my self thoughts and the things i have lied about do not come back harder. if you too are struggling from depression or anything major try and start fresh, seek help or talk to a close friend or go to a helpline, it may help in some way, or it might not, you never know if you do not try. my heart goes out to all people struggling from depression or anything major. 	moderate

i lied about wanting to get better a while ago a family member asked me if i wanted to get better, i said yes because i was scared they would be angry at me if i would have said no. someti ames i feel like having friends would be nice but in truth i think they would just makes things more complicated, they would be better off not knowing me. i am scared to get better now because being like this is normal for me, i do not know how i could cope with being a normal functioning person again. it all seems so draining and difficult. i wish i had a place i could go that was truly abandoned with no people whatsoever, i could just explore and enjoy the place without bothering other people or other people bothering me. thanks for reading this if you did.	moderate

looks can be deceiving folks! do i look happy? am i walking around with a smile on my face? yes. everyone says oh just fake it ti will you make it meaning fake being happy until you are happy. first off that sounds very unhealthy not that i am the poster boy of health that is just suppressing emotions. and , theres no way in hell i can muster enough energy to act happy all day everyday. because of my anxiety and depression i usually get like maybe hours of sleep a night. i act happy but when i get home i just break down completely.. i want to feel better	moderate
do not give up. depression is hard. it is unseen, unheard, yet it is there like a dark veil covering you all the ti ame. i was in a very dark place. my grandmother and grandfather passed away shortly after each other and then the girl i had been with for years cheated on me and left me with an appartment i couldnt afford getting me into debt. and then my aunt got cancer to make matters worse. i barely had energy to get out of bed, let alone get up and go to work for a very shabby paycheck. but i kept getting up, and went to work. stayed extra hours if i didnt make enough yet to pay my rent. i was on autopilot like this for a long ti ame, just barely going by my day to day life. social contact was getting less and less too. i didnt reach out and eventually people stopped reaching out too. i started smoking weed and started drinking a lot. gained a lot of weight because of it and an unhealthy diet of fastfood, but didnt care. all the things i liked doing before, gaming, football, chi willing with friends, became boring. everything was boring. i often had thoughts of just ending it, but didnt want to do that to my mom who always tried to help. so i just kept going like i was. then one day i just decided i had enough, yes the going had been rough, but i wouldnt let it get me down. i started working out and getting in touch with friends i had lost contact with. and started looking for a job that had a better pay to get out of my debts. i found that job through a friend i reached out to again and got out of my debts. now i sti will have some dark days, but they are far less common then before. and i feel like it is all getting a bit better slowly, but surely. i understand this wi will not help everyone, and not everyone can just flip a switch one day and say enough is enough, it is not that easy, all i am saying is do not give up. that change could come someday. it could be something inside yourself, or maybe something you witness happen. a song, a movie, anything. just dont give up. one day it might get better. but it definitely wi will not if you give up.	moderate

ex moved on so my ex moved on. its fucking hard man, like why could not she have been honest when we broke up, why could not she have said that i was the problem it would have made it so much easier. but no. she said that she wanted to take this year for herself, that she did not want to date, but here we are months later and she is seeing a new guy. like i dunno she is sti will my best friend and i want her to be happy but it feels like my heart is getting ripped out of my chest. i thought i would moved on but it hurts so badly, i do not know if its just jealousy cause i have not found anybody or what but i am sad and angry. like i knew i was the problem, we were talking just today after i found out and i asked her and she said i was too clingy and that but she never said anything when we were together. like i am glad we broke up because i like being clingy, i like being super affectionate, and we made each other miserable. but it sti will really hurts. i have also recently moved abroad and i am so lonely and homesick, plus my school just shut down cause of corona, i have not been sleeping and i am just so fucking overwhelmed right now. life just keeps hitting me over the head again and again and again, i do not know how much more i can fucking take.	moderate
what i need the most right now sorry if formatting is bad i am doing it on my phone you know what would help me like shitloads? somebody, a friend or a professional, telling me they think i am depressed. it may sound counterintuitive, but i have felt low for years since my friend abruptly left my school and for the entire span, i have felt, well, there is no other better word to describe it, depressed. it fluctuates, like some months i am literally miserable and i might hit a few weeks of being numb then back to being miserable yay . strangely enough, and i would have never seen it coming, i felt content for a while. this threw me off and although i always thought i was faking my gloom, this further convinced myself that i was really not that sad despite having done self harm acts such as cutting . these past weeks have been superb however i have been making efforts to speak to my friends but in the back of my brain, i know i wi will fuck it up and when i do, i wi will relapse and break my streak. currently, i feel good yet i sti will want a diagnosis but i do not know where to go and i am fucking terrified if i am truly not depressed because that wi will be my last straw.	moderate

maybe i am better off dead i have sunk so low into darkness and depression, to the point that i do not even think i can be saved, i tried therapy two ti ames but they dont understand me and they do not understand the agony i feel everyday. the only positive thing from therapy that i got diagnosed by professionals so my family can not manipulate me into thinking that i am okay and i am faking it. i am years old now and i have spent the majority of my life in extreme levels of depression and anxiety and it did a horrible damage on everything in my life. i do not feel passion for anything anymore and i do not have any kind of hope for the future. it is logical that i wi will eventually ki will myself before i get to years old that is my destiny	moderate

crying and alone sorry in advance for the semi long rant. my boyfriend of yrs decided it was a good ti ame to take a break for awhile or even, in his words to just break up. i am devastated. i suffer from anxiety and depression. i realize that it is not probably helping his depression either. he told me that when i get depressed, he gets depressed, that i need to find myself and he needs to find hi amself. i have no close friends, and my family does not really give me moral support. i lost my dad yrs ago, and the weight of everything he left was thrown at me. which started making my depression worse. before that i was getting better, slowly but better, then that happened and everything just crashed on me. his words sti will haunt me what are you going to do when i die? you re just probably going to lose everything. he emotionally abused my mother and i for a long ti ame. i feel it is ptsd but i was not officially diagnosed so i can not say. i have no insurance to go to a therapist. i tried a couple antidepressants one made me feel worse and the other made my eyes so dry, they hurt, so i have not tried again. now with corona virus, my current seasonal job is stalled for weeks. so i am really in a depressed state. video games are the only things that calm me, ever since i was a kid. keeps my thoughts that never shut off out for a little while. i figured i put what i feel on here since i am too afraid to say how i feel to anyone i know. i am on my phone so sorry for some poor grammar. i am not really paying attention. to the ones that read this, thank you for your ti ame.. i do not want to get into more details at the moment..	moderate
music blasting through the walls hey, sorry, i thought i would vent here considering when i tried to on facebook everyone just sorta was like its saturday, why dont you blast some music . i have finished a night shift at am and slept for a couple hours and have woken up to my neighbors blasting music for the past hour. it sounds like i am neighboring a nightclub with the bass going through my walls. i am almost having a nervous breakdown. i have to go back to sleep soon because i need more hours for work and dont get to do much but this is upsetting me. i can not even put in headphones to block it out because of its mainly loud bass. i just want to lay down in silence for a bit before i have to go to sleep ans this is driving me mad and i have already broke down crying and started screaming at the top of my voice. i dont know what to do. i have never met these neighbors and because its a saturday i think people dont have my side. it sounds louder than if my housemates were playing music through a kitchen, constant thumbing bass that is louder than my laptop. its driving me insane and i just want to lay down and relax in my room. i am a weak person so i can not go and ask them to stop, i dont even really know which one it s seeing it os loudest in my bedroom.	moderate
i am in freefall. i have never felt so isolated i have no support network, i have no one. i have kids that want to go out and play but i am fucking paralyzed by the thought of them getting coronavirus. i couldnt go anywhere even if that werent the case because i have an ev that has no charge. i was on r divorce but i can not post on there, everyone else is talking about the things their spouses did to them, and i can not do that. i am the piece of shit in this situation and frankly i can not hear other peoples problems right now. i sti will love her, but i know things wi will never be the same. my life has slipped past me, and i know that with the way i express myself, there wi will not be a calm conversation between us. as usual i wi will do something stupid because i dont know how to deal with my emotions. and so it goes, i wi will drive her further away and continue my spiral. i made it easy for her. she started thisconnecting years before we separated, and i let it happen. i can only i amagine that she went through what i am going through right now on a longer ti ameline. at least i hope she did. not because of any hatred or ani amosity, but because it has only been weeks and she is starting to go on dates, and it would hurt to be that thisposable. because i was stuck in a bubble, unable and unwi willing to reach out and get help. now i need it and wouldnt ya know it all the therapists are closed on saturday. i would feel better just to set up an appointment. i used to consider myself a loner, because i guess i never really truly experienced what it is like to be alone. well, reaching out to random people on the internet as a blubbering mess, trying not to let the kids hear me whi ampering in the next room is alone. they are missing their childhood because i can not cope with adulthood	moderate
realising my mother does not love me the way i love her ... has made my current depressive episode so much worse. sure, she loves me, about as much as you have to love your child. she does not actually give a shit or anything. i know, i sound like a child. unfortunately i am very much an adult, something she started saying the second i turned , and has continued to say ever since. it was never a good thing, btw. she views me as just someone who can no longer expect anything of her. she checked out emotionally many years ago, but that was when even the basic stuff, she stopped doing. i understand most people are not as close to their parents and probably wouldn t understand why i take this so hard. the truth is that i went through some awful shit as a child and my mother was the one i could usually rely on. we had a strong bond she raised me all by herself, just the two of us. she had me young, so we were often more like best friends than mother and child. which is what made it so painful for me when i was going through a really awful ti ame with my mental i willness and she abandoned me as a teen. i do not think i have ever really recovered from the emotional abandonment. most likely because i never really admitted that she does not love me all that much. she loves her husband, and my little brother, and she loves her mom, and her friends, and her dog. she does not love me the way she loves everyone else in her life. it is not that she does not love anybody, it is that she does not love me in particular. i am a broken toy, one she does not care to fix, one she would rather throw away. things are pretty bleak right now, what with the fact that no one gives a shit about me and i have no friends and very little wi will to live, and these realisations are certainly not helping. i know it is unlikely that anyone wi will read this, as most of my posts here go unnoticed and like the ones before, i wi will probably delete this when i realise no ones reading it lol , but if you are reading, thank you for taking the ti ame to listen to me. i appreciate this place here, where we can talk freely and openly in a way that other look down upon. it is nice.	moderate
running out of ti ame i do not have ti ame to talk to anyone about the craziness going on in my life. i actually do not have anyone to talk to either. but do not have ti ame to find a therapist etc. do not have ti ame to make friends and seek support. i wouldn t want to burden people with having a depressed friend anyways. or make friends just because i need them right now. i want people to need want me around.... i do not think anyone needs or wants to deal with a mentally i will person everyday. but people make it seem like understanding or caring about someone else is problems is the hardest thing in the world. they can not empathize or put themselves in others shoes. i never made myself a victi am in life even after the countless things i have been through. i was never seeking pity or sympathy from anyone, nor did i want them to care... i just wanted people close to me to understand what i am going through so they could stop adding to my problems. but they do not care and they do not even try to understand what i am going through. they just watch my life falling apart, in silence. yet they expect me to be involved in their drama whenever they need me involved. i can not believe i have been surrounded by heartless, selfish, thoughtless and ignorant humans my entire life. i wish this was not my reality. i wish i could just sleep forever. but i have no choice but to be strong and face it all all because i am a mom and i have a child to live for. i did not plan to be a parent baby was a surprise. fast forward years gt gt i never i amagined life would be so difficult for me! now i am tired of pushing through bad ti ames. i am tired of having to be strong. tired of having to fight. but recently it is not only humans affecting me, long term depression has led to procrastination and now ti ame is tic tocking against. life is not for the weak. the race is for those who can endure... but i am not sure i can not take anymore. i tried it, i could not find it and now i just want to get back to me. the peace i had before life became so difficult. i also got hit by a car while crossing at a cross walk years ago and it ruined my life but who fucking cares. if anyone reads this and comments please do not comment saying i am seeking pity or making myself a victi am like my sister says i am because i can not take it anymore. i do not want any pity or sympathy, i just wish someone would try to understand what i am dealing with but no one cares or tries to understand. i just want to die bc death seems like the only way for this nightmare to b over. but i have too much to live for. feels like i am being forced to stay living in this shitty world. i try to find new things to love about this planet, thistract myself from the dark side of my life. but i am tired of being fucking opti amistic all day everyday . tired of turning the other cheek. all the rage is building up inside of me and i am worried how it wi will be released. i just do not know what to do anymore. i used to smoke weed to calm down and i do not even want to smoke anymore. nothing seems appealing anymore except death. i know i need to see a doctor but i seriously do not have any fucking ti ame for that. i do not have ti ame for therapy or anything like treatment or recovery. i just want the problems and problematic people to thisappear but that is certainly not possible. i might as well just die	moderate

i decided that every step counts someti ames your big break in life comes as you wait. not because you re idly waiting, but because you re taking small steps to change as you wait. whether it is being brave enough to put a smile on your face when you do not feel like it, or it is being able to finally fall asleep at am, every small step counts. my dad abandoned us when i was and my mom puts that blame on me, home was and sti will is a hellhole for me. my ex took her own life a few years back because of her family is bullying and i sti will can not help but think that i should have done better to support her when i could. i have been battling bed bugs for years and i can not afford to exterminate them, so i sleep in constant physical and mental pain every night. i can not open up enough to build quality friendships because of the trauma of being bullied and betrayed when i was younger. my random anxiety and panic attacks keep me from being efficient at work and it affects me deeply when i burden my team. i have attempted to take my own life plenty of ti ames but failed miserably because the thought of my siblings having to deal with a lost ki wills me inside. i am not okay and i have been battling depression for god knows how long and i am sti will fighting it as i write this. but i made the decision to count every small win in hopes that one day, someday, i might get better and just become a better me. i might succeed, i might not. but i decided that i want to try to get better. and i hope that anyone who sees this can try to as well, so that if we do win this war, we would not win this alone.	moderate
is life really not for everyone? i came across this question on reddit someti ame ago and it has stuck with me ever since. every now and then, i ask myself the same question is life really not for me? i tried to live like a normal person, i really did. but i can not. i lost three of my loved ones to death over a span of years. i started shutting myself out because i was so depressed. now i find myself not having any true connection with any of my friends anymore... so i do not tell them my problems. neither can i turn to my family because i did not want them to worry about me, especially since they have seen me made a little progress last year. but lately i have fallen back into the darkness again. i started skipping classes and my project mates think that i am free riding them and probably hate me for that. i do not know how and do not want to explain to them either because they wi will never understand. i want to contribute something but i can not catch up with the pace of the class because my depression and anxiety are affecting my concentration. then my mental health caught up with my physical health. when i get stressed i fall sick and my productivity drops even more. i can not even complete a si ample assignment now.... these made my anxiety even worse. and i have been evergreen for my entire life. with all the aspects in my life going wrong, do you understand why i asked if life is for everyone now? i should not say this but someti ames i really wish i was the one who died instead. my loved ones, they fought so hard on the hospital bed, trying to stay alive, up until their last breath... made me feel guilty for wanting to die and throw away my life like that. but i really do not think i can hang on for much longer anymore. this is too much to bear.	moderate

i wouldn t be depressed if i was better looking people do not care about ugly ass people like me. i just like to i amagine if i was good looking how much more people would care about me, but since i am an unattractive guy no one wi will even bother being friends or in a relationship with me. i can not even look at pictures of myself without being reminded of how bad i look. my life would be completely different if i was tall and good looking. why good looking people deserve more than i do. the only difference between them and i is they happened to be born that way. people like me are always subconsciously thiscri aminated against si amply because of our appearance	moderate

i lashed out at the person closest to me during a suicidal breakdown. how can i start the path to fixing our relationship and do i even have the right to me m lashed out at my best friend f when i was at my worse. it got really ugly. i went to her first hoping she could talk me down but she was literally about to be on a plane and could not leave so i ended up lashing out saying things along the lines of you do not even care maybe if you were here you could stop me etc essentially blaming her if i ki willed myself. i kept saying things like this until she was getting on the plane and had to block me. she is also depressive and even said you can not ki will yourself because i would too. she ended up getting me help by reaching out to family to save me. but the emotional abuse i gave her that day was too much and she is leaving my life for now and i do not know if it is forever i do not know how she could forgive me after i was such a piece of shit to her. any advice on how to start healing? or are we lost forever. anything unclear just ask i am bad at formulating thoughts someti ames.	moderate
i am a bad person was already having a kinda down day but it got worse when i had a bad epiphany i guess. in the beginning of the day i just felt unattractive and unwanted, just ugly really. went to lay down for a bit to clear my head and maybe cry a little. got a message from my grandmother asking why i forgot her birthday. and then i realized that i forgot my sister is birthday this year too. i love these people, especially my sister. it breaks my heart that i did not seem to care enough to remember. i then began to think about how i have been treating people lately. i have basically been rude or incomprehensible a larger portion than usual and a lot of the ti ames i am just really scraping to be nice enough to be around. my kindness is no longer organic. and it did not take long to just think that i am a bad person. i never wanted to be a bad person, i do not think anyone does. but i just am. i am ugly, rude, cynical, thoughtless, and utterly worthless. this, of course, gets paired with suicidal ideation and now my mind is where it is at. i do not know where to go from here.	moderate

how the people around me fucked me up i used to be a very talkative kid when i was about to years old. my mom would tell me stories about how i would not stop talking about this and that. she said that i would tell her everything that happened to me everyday. when we were in the province, my mom told me that she would only go for a walk and that she wi will be back after some ti ame. the next thing i knew was that i saw her riding in a jeepney going to the terminal to go home to the city. that was the first ti ame i felt abandoned. i was . when my mom and i would argue, she would not embrace me when we go to sleep and would let me cry all night without talking to me. i was . my mom used to beat me up when i was a kid. i can not remember the reason behind my first beating but i remember one ti ame, she asked me to solve math problems and i said i can not do it. she hit me with a back scratcher multiple ti ames and threw my stuffed toys out of the bed and told me that i am not allowed to sleep until i finish solving. i remember crying to my grandmother and i saw the pity on her eyes because she also does not know what to do. i always have this constant fear that when i fail a test she is going to beat me up again so when my test papers were returned and the scores are low, i would cry i ammediately. there was a ti ame when i do not know how to do my homework and my mom was scolding me in front of my dad and i was crying so hard and i looked at hi am while expecting hi am to come to my aid but he just stared at me like i am a random kid wailing at the mall. he also used to order me to buy beer and cigarettes for hi am and to keep it a secret. my mom and my dad also fought once when i was around. we were going to sleep and my dad was ranting about something but she covered my ears so that i would not hear hi am. i was years old back then. we moved to a new house to have a fresh start in . she sti will beats me occasionally and i became conscious of the neighbors hearing me cry. i can sti will remember that i would beg my mom to let me close the door first before she beat me so that they would not hear me. i was . i was going through my mom is old phone when i saw my father is old messages arguing with my mom that he is hungry for sex and he just want it because it is his right. reading that messages fucked me up real good. maybe that is why i am afraid to have sex with anybody. i used to bring my friends to our house to play but when my mom sees something that she does not want, she wi will scold me in front of my friends and someti ames get physical with me even if they are around. i was . i never brought friends over in my house when she is around since then. she would also go through my stuff especially my phone. she would read my messages and it would make me panic because there are things in there that she is not supposed to see. i would become hysterical and she would just threaten me that she wi will not give my phone back if i would not give her my phone password. we have been through this a lot of ti ames and until now i am afraid to let go of my phone around her. i was always one of the best student in our class during my junior high school years but i was not recognized because i am always shy and quiet. when i am with my friends i always put this happy mask and go along with them even when i am against something because that was the only thing i know to keep them. obedience. one of my teachers that i saw as a father figure asked me to eat with hi am outside the school premises and would nag me about why i am not responding to his chats and would call me on my personal number when he can not reach me through messenger. he used to screenshot my profile pictures and send it to me and he would leave a comment that says you re turning more beautiful now . he would also ask me when i wi will visit because he already misses me. i was sti will a minor. the first guy that courted me was my friend. he was sweet and was always there for me when i needed hi am. my view of love before was not healthy. i was raised that to show your love, you must submit. i did everything to put hi am under my leash and to make hi am believe that he is wrong and i am right. after months he gave up on me. part of me was to blame. i am . i was friends with people that made me feel that what i do is wrong. i am afraid to go against them because they are the only ones i got. i was with my friends drinking on the rooftop when suddenly one of my friend is friend followed me downstairs when i am about to pee. he said that he wi will stay with me and assist me since i am a little drunk already. when i am done and opened the bathroom door, the room was pitch black and the lights were off. he was standing in front of me and grabbed my hand. it is gentle but it thisgusts me. i went to switch the lights on and one of my friends opened the door and said that he wi will leave us both there to have a good ti ame and by that he means sex and kissing . i am not comfortable and i was shaking my head lightly but he did not get the message. the guy that i am with closed the door and locked it from the inside. he said that it is better if i sit down with hi am on the sofa. i did but i i ammediately got up because i am not feeling good. i made an execuse that my mom is texting me and she is already pissed so i have to reply to her. he repeatedly called my name and it sent shivers down my spine. i continued to chat my friends pretending that they are mom and then he grabbed my arm with a little force to make me sit down. i was panicking at this ti ame and thankfully my friends knocked loudly on the door to get me. i can see the thisappointment in his eyes and i was so relieved i cried when we got out.	moderate

how to stop feeling like you do not deserve a partner? i have social anxiety, so it is hard enough to approach somebody, but the last thing to go through my mind before i have talked myself up is, nobody has shown interest in you. there is probably something wrong with you. you do not really deserve a partner anyway. they are probably too good for you. i feel like i am valuable and loved around my friends and family and i feel like i can stand up for myself around people i know but when it comes to strangers in public i feel like a burden and unworthy of fun social interaction. how can i get over these irrational feelings?	moderate

my college career abruptly ended and even if it was overall a tough confusing ti ame for me, i am pretty sad. i spent a lot of the three and a quarter years of college sad, lonely and trapped. i never went out, went to any events, and rarely made myself available to meet people. i had one pretty consistent friend group but i was often not happy with them and only hung with them cause there was not really anybody else there for me. i had fun ti ames with them, laughed a lot, but there was sti will something rotten in me when i was with them and it felt like something was always missing. i had a few individual friends outside of them too but i never felt connected, like in it you know like the college experience seems like it is supposed to be. on the other hand it seems to me that that idea might be fake, and that all those people are kind of figuring shit out and putting it together in the same way i am and what i am is pretty much the standard but it sti will hurts. i talked to a friend a few days ago who was talking about how sad it was that her art shows were cancelled and some of the school parties and events weren t going to happen and i was upset i did not have that same connection. in a way, it feels like i won though, i would not deny that. all of the things that other people seemed to have over these years are gone, the things that is stressed me, i get to go out without literally missing out on anything, everyone level with me. but i am sti will sad. i want to be connected and feel loved, and it feels like i would not be able to in that pure youth environment. i have ideas about being able to get more of that in my twenties now that i feel more confident and that there is really nothing to be afraid of, when i go out there and give things a shot then people really tend to like me, maybe trying some study abroad grad school thing or looking for a fun thing like that. but i am sti will anxious and sad and so so confused. so anyone reading this who is feeling si amilar things, or if you re just sad that you got college ripped from you, i am sending love. anyone reading this and going through anything si amilar to be honest i send love, feel free to reach out to me if you need and any words of reassurance love would be appreciated 	moderate

i just sent my fiancee away to be with her parents as i fear it is no longer safe for her here as the coronavirus gets much worse. i have never felt so empty and afraid. i am and f and i have been together with my fiancee for almost years. today, after much heartache and debate i sent her away to stay with her parents as this terrible virus gets worse in my region. we are both well, however she has pre existing health conditions including asthma and chronic fatigue syndrome and falls into an at risk category so i was not wi willing to let her stay with me and risk her catching. she would not make the final decision to leave as she want very much to stay with me, and so i made it for her and told her she had to leave for her safety. we both sobbed and cried for hours as we do not know when we wi will see each other face to face again as we do not know what the government wi will do next and which areas wi will be safe. i packed her things with her, gave her useful things from the house and she left for her parents house just over an hour ago. i have to stay to make sure my father has everything he needs, but i could not risk allowing her to stay with me as it wi will be far more serious if she catches it than if i do. i am so thistraught and i can not speak as the tears wi will not stop. i know i have made the best decision for her but i feel dead and hopeless inside without her. i have suffered from serious depression throughout life and she is the only reason i am manage to overcome these feelings...without her i am lost. i fear she may think i am heartless for sending her away and that i am tired of her, but i swear before god this is not so. i did this because i am afraid and want her to be safe and it is safer where her parents are. i made an account just to vent because i can not stop crying because now i am alone and very afraid. i never expected this sort of thing to happen like this i thought it was just like this in movies. i keep asking aloud, how did this thing happen? , but there is nobody here to answer me and the silence is overwhelming. i just try to console myself by thinking i have put my fiancee before myself and tried to do the best things for her.	moderate

how to get over a failed friendship? i feel really depressed over it. i knew my friend for years. granted, it was an online friendship but it does not mean it hurts any less knowing that things were never going to work out between us. for the longest ti ame i thought she was one of the few people who truly cared about me. i struggled with alcoholism for a ti ame and she would always remind me of my anniversaries and the number of days that i managed to avoided alcohol. she would always tell me that i was a great guy, that she loved talking to me, she would tell me that she missed me when i was not around. we confided in each other about a lot of personal stuff and we trusted each other. we even made plans to meet up over the summer since she lives in my area. over ti ame though, things just got weird. she stopped messaging me first. it turned into a situation where i was always the one to initiate every conversation. whenever i did message her, she would give vague and short responses. she stopped reminding me of my anniversaries. she started clai aming that she was too tired or too busy to talk to me. she would leave me on read for days. she would frequently set her status to do not thisturb on the platform we talked on for entire days. i asked her if everything was alright, and she told me the same i care about you and i like talking to you stuff. she tried to assure me that it was nothing personal. i just could not deal with it though. the signs that she did not want to talk to me anymore became more and more obvious to me. it really seemed like she just wanted nothing to do with me anymore despite her telling me that she cared about me. i just felt really hurt over the fact that she did not seem to like talking to me anymore. i deleted my account on the platform we talked on a few days ago. she was basically my only online friend. i feel really depressed that i would not get to talk to her anymore. i spend most of my ti ame trying to sleep off the depression but it does not really help. i feel angry, hurt, and confused. i started drinking again to try and numb the feelings. i do not know where things went wrong, i do not know what i could have done differently. it just hurts knowing that someone who clai amed to care about me does not anymore. does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this situation?	moderate

i am not sure how to convince my boyfriend to get help i think my boyfriend is depressed and he would benefit from getting professional help, but he refuses to talk to anyone about it. for the past year or so he has been showing a lot of symptoms of depression, he is convinced that he is useless and unworthy of love and he beats hi amself up over the smallest things and i try talking to hi am about it and comfort hi am but nothing works, he does not believe me. the things he used to love doing have become a chore to hi am and instead of making hi am happy it just frustrates hi am and makes hi am feel worse because he can not do them as well as he used to. whenever i suggest hi am to talking to someone and maybe getting some professional help he always shuts me down because he thinks that he can not be helped and he wi will be stuck like this forever. it breaks my heart and worries me a lot, he means the world to me and seeing hi am struggle so much but knowing there is nothing i can really do to help is difficult. i do not really know if this is an advice post or a rant, i am just really worried and i am terrified of losing hi am one day because he bottled everything up.	moderate

being depressed is ruining my life title sums it up really. every aspect of my life has gradually become consumed over the course of my life and it just keeps getting worse. when people tell me it wi will get better i do not believe them at all. i can not sleep right, i can not eat right, i get no joy from the things i love and value like reading or playing piano or being with my family it all just irritates me or i can not concentrate on it, i often can not get to college so i am really behind in everything, i can not get myself to exercise or even take the dog out if my mum needs me to, i have utterly lost my way with words, my self esteem is shattered to pieces, my friendships with people feel false and i can not forge a sturdy relationship with anyone and even if i could it would be ruined by the constant stream of negativity in my mind, someti ames i can not even shower more than once a week. i feel so thistant and thisconnected from everything all of the ti ame granted, someti ames more than others and it makes me feel like complete sh te, because i feel so separate from everything i love i do not feel as though i have a close connection with anyone anymore and i do not have the energy to sustain one. i can hardly envision a future for myself, and when i can it is incredibly bleak and miserable. the few dreams i have also feel completely out of reach and unattainable, along with the promise that it wi will get better . my counselling has stopped because the nhs can not fund it so i am just on prescription drugs and yet another waiting list for god knows how long. i am feeling so hopeless and out of place with nowhere to turn i just want to fade away into nothingness and never come back. please just a kind word, anything at all would be good	moderate

weak wi will for life i have been battling with not having a strong wi will to live recently. i obviously want to live but it just seems hard to live. i just want to lay in my bed and sleep in the dark. i have started wellbutrin days ago and it is helping some but i am also in the early side effects stages of taking it too. i just do not know what to do. i feel like i need to be hospitalized but i have no plan of harming myself so i doubt they would admit me. furthermore, my family does not seem supportive of me being hospitalized. i also do not like the stigma attached to it but i am getting to where i do not care. i just want help and i just want to feel normal again and driven about something in life. i have been off work for a few weeks now but have not been fired yet. i am guess i am just seeking for some help because i can not seem to get there on my own in real life.	moderate
trying to put it into words how i am feeling do you ever just welcome the sorrow? it is so common place and happens so often that you do not try to push it down, but instead wear it like clothing? you purposefully open yourself up to the thoughts and let them envelope you? i feel like there is almost a sick comfort in it for me. like its my reality, and it is me accepting my place in everything. like some of us were made to be the melancholy ones.	moderate

i just feel too sensitive and pathetic for this world maybe it is just young adult angst. the weight of the world on my shoulders thing. but i just can not take the hate, prejudice, thiscri amination, ignorance, fighting, division, and politics of the world. the world wi will never be how i want it to be. people wi will always be hateful, stupid, elitist, judgmental, and whatever else. they say if we all got along the world would be boring. but i do not think the world is exciting now. unless people like the destruction and degradation. gives them a rush of dopamine and entertains them. maybe that is why reality shows are popular. most people can live with this. they do not worry about it. maybe they did at one point, but not anymore. they learned to accept it. i did too finally, but now i am back to square one. something triggered me recently. now i am sitting here wishing for death. so much worry, anxiety, fear, paranoia, insecurity, shame, and embarrassment. arguing with myself inside my head. i just want it to stop. i have tried mindfulness and just letting go. it worked but was easily destroyed. i hate myself and my actions and i feel deep shame and embarrassment for other people is actions. i can not take it. i want to bash my skull in.	moderate

so there is this girl i like... so i met this girl at my new job a while back, turns out we have been in pretty close proxi amity for a while, just never met. we re both students and she is part of the skiing club i was in a couple of years back. i quit the club after a year, i guess because i felt like i did not fit in. looking back everyone was super friendly and i really enjoyed the activity, but i just convinced myself that i do not belong. she convinced me to join the club again, i started snowboarding again and love it, wish i never quit. but this girl, she is amazing. she is cute, friendly, funny. just one of those people who always says hello in that way that gives you energy for the rest of the day. we re both part ti ame and work separately she is in the store front and i am in the back office, so we do not see each other much, but every ti ame we talked it was like she took a genuine interest in me. not just smalltalk, you know? even with the club we rarely seem to be in the same place at the same ti ame, but then there was this trip planned. every year the club plans a week long skiing trip in the french alps a couple of dozen of us on a mountain in a shitty hostel drinking gratuitous amounts of alcohol and falling over in the snow. i was looking forward to this so much. i have not been on a holiday in a long long ti ame. i could not afford to go when i was in the club those years back, but most of all i was excited because this girl was going. i saw this as the opportunity to get closer, actually get to know this girl, make sure my feelings are real and maybe make a move. tonight france goes into lockdown, my trip is not happening. every plan i had just came crashing down, and it is not going to happen. it is kind of a wakeup call, because all those plans weren t really plans, they were fantasies. i i amagined us going away together, falling for each other and starting this amazing relationship that could be exactly what i need to fi will this hole i feel in my life. reality is i am not charming enough or confident enough, or in any way enough of a catch to make it happen so smoothly. it was never going to go that way, it was all just in my head. fuck, i do not even know if she is single. i have been riding this fantasy for so long and now i am figuring out i have just been letting my life go by. i could have been with this girl all this ti ame, but it did not match up with my fantasy, so i did not even consider it. i actually saw her in work today, as soon as i walked in she started talking to me. later i went to grab coffee and when i was making my way back to my office she called after me just to give a funny little tidbit about one of our coworkers. when i went out for lunch i passed her carrying something made of straw, she looked proud as punch telling me that she would just bought a house for her rabbit. when i was leaving in the evening, she asked how my day was since i was alone in the office today. when i walked back into the store because i forgot to hand over the keys, she gave me this huge smug grin and asked what i would forgotten. like, she seems to take every opportunity to interact with me, she once dropped everything she was doing to literally jump out in an isle and ask me a question. maybe she likes me, maybe she is just friendly, but at the very least i can tell that she wants to know me and i have been doing nothing with it because it does not line up with my perfect fantasy. i am so scared of anything being messy or not working out that i would rather just live in my head than try to make the real thing happen. this is not the only fantasy i have let take over, but it is been the most crushing. i fucking hate this. i have worked so hard to get over anxiety and i amprove my mood in the day to day, but i wi will never be happy if i am not taking risks in the long term, and i just can not do it.	moderate

every path i take ends in depression yo here. been depressed for as long as i remember. self harm started around , years old. no, i was not abused, i guess i am just fucked up in the head. spent most of the ti ames reading in childhood which led to a bigger gap between me and the other kids. my school and highschool ti ame is a haze but i remember trying so hard to be normal until i managed to do something, anything to get anyone to laugh at me. thinking back, i guess i wanted some attention since i did not have any friends. thanks god, things did get better at university. but while i was for the first ti ame happy, the downside is that i fell deeper in depression every now and then. self harm started to get worse until i needed stitches for deep cut who wouldn t stop bleeding for days. got a job, had the best period of my life but i sti will managed to fuck it up. best grade, best friends, best period of my life. also worse breakdowns and depressions. i can not manage a relationship since i have no clue of what to do, from kissing to fucking. managed to leave my job to focus on uni but lost my friends on the way. tried to get back in the loop with them but no interest from anyone outside of me. so that is how i managed to get to am, blood from cutting on me, depressed as fuck after months without self harming. way to go me! no money for drugs, can not do any hobby since the coronavirus is sti will out and my country is pretty much closed. no uni so too much of reflexion. no money for therapy, no money for alcohol. fuck my life anyone else in this kind of situation or am i the only fucked up enough for this? i wi will take any advice, it can not be worse than what i have in my head...	moderate

i do not know if i am depressed i recently broke up with my ex, it was a mentally draining relationship, she reluctantly agreed to the break up to give me space as she knows i am not doing so well mentally and understands i want to be left alone, but since then i have been crying every night when i am left alone with my thoughts. i have no appetite, i browse reddit and watch funny videos to try and thistract myself from thinking but it is thisrupting my sleep, i am only getting hours of sleep daily. i really miss her but i know i should not get back with her as it would only hurt me. but i feel so pathetic without her, she was there for me when my mom passed and life feels empty without her. i know i should not get back with her but i feel like i need to. i feel very conflicted as to whether i should get back with her or stay as friends and i honestly do not know what to choose. and honestly i would very much rather end my life than have to choose an option i hope this is not seen as attention seeking, i just wanted to talk to someone or atleast get this out of my system	moderate

someone asked what do you mean your life is shit and i wrote this i did not actually send it to them, since it got a bit long so just said tldr same old since i have talked to them about this before, but never actually articulated it before. just need to vent this out tbh. i am a guy who is never had any interest shown in hi am yes no one has kissed me, exactly like a subhuman, abnormal, waste of space. the fact remains that i am sti will completely alone, and unwanted, i have always been alone and unwanted, and that is always going to be the case. literally today had to listen to a podcast say love is human , and it is so true i am subhuman. everyone falls in love, and has someone who loves them eventually, but at the very least by my age they have felt wanted . even if they have not got someone, they have had someone actually want to be with them. i have never felt that, and i am never going to. i am never going to have that great first date, any first kiss never mind that first kiss with someone you really like, not even some drunken mistake to laugh about, i am never going to have that ohh i wonder if they like me feeling because i know it is always no , and no one is ever going to feel that way about me. the only thing close to this i ever have experienced, and ever wi will experience, is unrequited love. so many people hate the fact they have been single for x months or whatever, now i amagine that being the case for your whole life, and knowing it is your future. for those people it is a matter of ti ame, and for me there is just non stop sadness and pain knowing that i am never going to be happy. everyone goes on about oh yeah single life is fun, has its benefits but not when there is no chance of that ever changing. i am going to have to sit on the side while everyone i know moves through life as normal, not even knowing it is possible to be like me. watching everyone have what is totally unavailable to me, like it is the most normal thing in the world because it is. and as everyone moves onto more i amportant things, and their ti ame is mostly spent with their partners and their kids i am going to be more and more alone socially as well. i just want to be wanted, it is something everyone feels but it is out of reach for me. someone please just put an end to me.	moderate
i need help! hey, first ti ame using this subreddit i came across some posts of people asking for advice on how to help your partner with depression motivation, etc. i have trouble helping my girl who is diagnosed with clinical depression, it is something new to me so i do not really know how to go with it and how to give your partner motivation to change their bad habits and help them bounce back and get out of the bad routine for them. i am very aware that i can not fix their depression i just have issues giving them the right comfort. she does not seem to find a reason to even start doing something for example whenever i tell her that motiving herself to work out or eat healthy might work for her she tells me what is the point though? so it leaves me in a really confusing and helpless state where i feel like i am not doing good enough	moderate

you know whats exhausting ? rant living, yeah that is one. you know what else ? trying so hard to convince two people at once, one of your closest friends, and one of your online friends, that its worth it to stay alive. trying so hard to explain how much they would be missed, and how suicide is not the answer. while your also trying so hard to stay alive on a day to day basis and you feel like a hypocrite because your over here trying to help people when you can not even help yourself. the your closest friend does not believe a word you say and acts like no one would miss her. and its so frustrating because why should you bother trying so hard to convince her if she wi will not believe a word you say. and your here, laying in bed typing on a laptop, wondering if you should even bother getting up today, daydreaming about dying. i am so sick of being the strong friend, lately i have been trying to be more open with people, but everyone has problems, and i can not be weak cause they need me to be strong. so i am going to start faking the smile again, i am going to start saying i am fine. i tried to be open about not being okay, but i should not have bothered.	moderate
dae ever feel like just sell everything and like buy a boat and just travel the world to get away from everything and everyone? i someti ame on and off get the strong urge to just pick up and leave my whole life behind. it have started to happen more often the older i have gotten. i got lovely parents and siblings. and atm a lovely partner which with whom i share a house that we bought a couple of years ago. due to medical circumstances we have had to put some of our life plans on hold and i have suffered from some sort of depression the last year. both bc of the putting life on hold, the medical stuff, but also bc i have a lot of problems with my current job. so i can somewhat understand that the urge to just ditch everything is once again on my mind. but at the same ti ame i somewhat suspect that i wouldn t t be happy even if i took that jump into the unknown. and i am hesitant do alter to much in my life atm of the big stuff, as long as i am not feeling that great bc i do not want to regret it later when i am back at being myself. but at the same ti ame i somewhat know that i have to alter stuff to get out of this depression and situation i am in. so i am kinda just stuck, booth physical and emotional atm, and it just sucks and is eating me up from the inside. but apparently i have a to good poker face for it to show, which even my psychiatrist says, do not know if i should take it as a compli ament or not. i just do not like showing feelings to strangers, not to anybody really so i just bottle the most things up. which i know is not good, but i suck at handling my own emotions. and when i even can not explain to myself why i feel as i do, how in the world should i be able to explain it to someone else. sorry for the rant but i am just wondering if anybody else have been feeling something si amilar and what you maybe did to get out of it?	moderate
in the end...minecraft is probably the answer as a year old autist i do not have anything going for me. jobs do not hire autistic people unless you are the whitewashed good doctor autistic. the only job autistic people can get is a dead end . thishwasher every other weekend job. women find autistic people as creeps due to their shit social ski will. i am about to be and i do not want to live with my parents for another years or get sent to a mental house due to how suicidal i am....so in reality minecrafting myself is the answer. minecraft meaning sunset meaning off yourself.	moderate

feeling especially detached and lonely today while i travel. i have been feeling especially detached from my self and really lonely today. i have been traveling for work and i am alone and away from my family, friends and so. my job requires me to travel often and someti ames i find myself feeling further away from myself and hard to ground myself. i have had depression, anxiety and derealization depersonalization for almost half my life so for the most part i have learned how to cope and function the best i can. today is one of those days where these feelings are hitting me hard and i am feeling very lost. i worked a hour week and on thursday it all started to catch up to me the sleep deprivation, anxiety and stress. usually being at work helps thistract me from those feelings of detachment and loneliness but i started feeling more anxious and out of my body and became very aware of it. it became hard to talk to other people because i would feel like it was not me who was talking in the middle of my sentences and then start focusing on those thoughts instead of the present moment. i do not get to go home until the end of this week and i am having some trouble coping. i do not know how i am going to get through this week if i keep feeling this way especially in the workplace. i am feeling really lonely, far away from everyone especially during this state of panic where all my friends get to work from home and these feelings are escalating. there is a feeling in my chest that just feels really down and i want to cry right now. it is starting to affect my mental state as well as how i function at work. would greatly appreciate any advice or words of comfort. tldr traveling for work this week has started to take a toll on me and i am feeling very depressed and away from myself and everything around me.	moderate
i just found out that an aquintance of mine and i had the same demon i recently got in contact with an aquintance that i knew during the early half of attending university. then our conversation arrived at a point where we asked each other what was the reason we ended up dropping a lot of our subjects and ulti amately late for graduation. she opened up that a friend of mine harassed and bullied her nonstop until she broke down and started missing a lot of her classes. and she fell into depression. i broke away from this friend because of the same reason, she did not bully me. though thinking now, i think she saw me as someone convinient. i slowly saw this person is toxicity and attitude towards others that she does not see as someone she can take advantage of and i parted ways with her. later on, i noticed that alot of our common friends started avoiding me the people that i intoduced to her. sure enough, my reputation was already destroyed by her with lies upon lies. soon after i also started missing classes, and avoiding people. a lot of things fell apart in my life after that. after hearing that this aquintance and i had the same person that started out spiral to rock bottom, i realized how vile that friend was. we re both trying to recover now, step by step. though a lot of the ti ames i sti will want to end it all, i want to see this aquintance get better and find happiness.	moderate

life is thisappointing and so am i. my life is thisappointing. it is not bad. not by any means. i have a loving family and partner. i have been given a good education, i have thisposable income, some good friends and have always had not so run of the mi will jobs. but everyday i am fi willed with dread and thisappointment. i just look at my life and i am like meh . i get told that this way of thinking is ungrateful. others have it much worse and do not get me wrong they do. i would take meh over cancer or abuse any day but it sti will does not change the feeling of catastrophic thisappointment i feel towards life. and i feel like i am running out of options. i am not a social cli amber or a company man. i just cba. i mean i was and could have been these things but even at the top of my game it all seemed frivolous. a battle between peers to feel like you had some sort of power over others situations to help validate yourself. not for me. i am not a creative either, again could have been had some potential. going back to education i attended of the top schools in my country for the creative field i persued. but ulti amately i watched as others found passion in their creations and transformed this into validation towards their lives while all i found was frustration and an overwhelming feeling of pointlessness. someti ames i think maybe if i won the lottery or became rich or famous life would present more avenues for excitement and life would seem less entropic. then i think what would really change. i would sti will get up, maybe do some work, chat to people, eat and go to bed. my clothes would be nicer, maybe i would go on holiday more but sadly life is experiences are quintessentially the same and that is fucking scary. now i just think maybe life is just one big thisappointment and then you die, or more likely i am not particularly that special and that is thisappointing, so a thisappointing life with ensue. summary i wi will forever stay depressed at my mediocre life because i can not see past it is thisappointments.	moderate

voices all my life my family kept calling me dumb, stupid, and ignorant whenever i made a mistake. may it be a small mistake, or a big one. it hurt a lot at first but now i have grown so accustomed to it that i do not feel anything anymore when they say those words. however, i find myself in a rut because of it. i have been struggling a lot academically and all i hear in my head are the words they tell me about how stupid i am, but the worst part is it is my own voice i hear in my head, not theirs. it had become a routine for me to degrade myself in my head, which is why it is i ammensely difficult for me to move forward and actually achieve something. when an intellectual problem challenge comes my way, i just tend to step back and fade away in the thistance. i am afraid that i would not be able to achieve my dreams because i have a voice in my head that tells me i would never do it. i know some might think that this is definitely under my control, but this voice can someti ames be so overpowering it makes me weak to my knees. what do i do?	moderate
more selfish complaints two days ago i took initiative towards my suicide attempt for the first ti ame. i have had it planned for some ti ame already, but this ti ame i actually took a pi will. only one, no big deal, i know, but it is sti will rough. it is been nights and my bf has been off ever since he got drunk today and went do whatever. i know, i can not demand hi am to stay or anything, if he does not want to it is ok... it just feel so cold, you know? he is feeling bad, he said. well, on that very night he i called hi am and he freaked out, got mad and yelled at me. then he started crying and tried to calm hi am down, it worked, but i ended up taking care of hi am, not hi am of me. same happens with me cutting myself, whenever i tell hi am i really want to hurt myself he guilt trips me into not doing it by telling me he wi will do it hi amself. i know he means well, but i can not help being upset when he leaves me because hes felling bad. i am always there for hi am or i try to be ... hes lovely otherwise though. he tries to help me, i know it. i know how selfish this is, i am sorry	moderate
nobody acts like they care about me. i am always in so much pain. even the people who know i am suffering, such as my parents, seem to think it is less than it actually is. even as i struggle to prepare three meals a day for myself, leading to kg of weight loss last year, even as i live in gri ame and filth which is only kept in check by my own inactivity and even as my parents accept that even a si ample technical college course might be too much work and stress for me, i do not see much comfort from anyone. my divorced mother tells me that she blames herself for leaving me on my own, yet even when i lived with her the best i would get would be an i do not blame you for your mistakes . but that is all anyone ever acknowledges my mistakes. i do not see how anyone can see this as a substitute for comforting someone. i do not blame her. she does not know any better. but i can not feel as though she cares about me, even when i know she does, when i have not really been comforted by her in years of life when i have been put down for my mistakes, over and over and over again, but never praised, never having any sort of redeeming values be recognised. i have friends, but when other friends prevent me from contacting them, while they do reach out to me, they never really bother to spend ti ame with me beyond giving me their condolences. someti ames it feels like life is conspiring, not to keep me isolated, but to make me feel as though nobody truly cares about me, even if they do include me in their social life. lastly, i would like to ask this if people truly care about me, but they obstinately refuse to ever show me that they do, how is this supposed to make me feel as though life is worthwhile? when i am isolated beyond isolation itself, when even my most earnest efforts to connect with other human beings on a deeper level always result in nothing, how am i not supposed to feel as though life has never offered me anything? how am i supposed to trust it to ever offer me anything, when whatever it has to offer is so scarce i have not caught a gli ampse of it throughout all my life?	moderate

its getting harder to stay happy i usually act happy around any and everyone. but starting about two weeks ago, it is feeling heavier and heavier as the days go by. hell for the first ti ame in six years i cut myself. i try to keep myself up but i keep getting sucked down into the abyss. i have also been dealing with with these rather dark fantasies. like a substitute teacher i had, the fantasy was me beating his face into a desk repeatedly, until he was lathered in his blood, then cutting hi am up and thisposing of hi am around my state. along with the fantasies of me dead in various styles it is getting to a point where i do not even except to wake up or even get home alive. it is that severe. i have had three friends accidentally see the scars from where i cut, and they appear to understand me more than before. and there is always those that say it is for attention. but i personally say fuck em they wouldn t understand.	moderate

vent i am very lonely and depressed i am a yo male. in my personal ti ame, i try to thistract myself with things to do, so i can fight the loneliness. at ti ames, i have a thought that i should just ki will myself and get it over with because i am going to be alone forever. i am a software engineer, and girls do not really like it guys. i think it is just going to get worse for me. i have looked up ways to ki will myself. i think overdosing is probably the best way to go. i have tried things like rsd real social dynamics . i have gone out to clubs and bars, and i have approached women, but i face a lot of rejection. my co workers make fun of me because i am not good at talking to girls. i am very ashamed by it. i understand why women are not attracted to me, though. it is because they do not see any value in me. i have little to no social status. the last ti ame i had a girl friend was when i was , so years ago. after that, my best friend was my dog who is now dead. i realize that i have to go out and make serendipity happen. a girl is not just going to come up and knock on my door. i just do not understand why it has to be so hard. why can not i just be enough to someone? life was supposed to be different, and i have become extremely thisenchanted with life. one of these days, i am going to snap. i wi will have that bottle of pi wills ready.	moderate

overwhelmed i am quite depressed. have been for the past years and right now i would say it feels like it is at its peak. i just got into school for ems and i swear i am going to go insane from just constantly being stuck in my head. every single day is a battle and i am just fuckin sick of it. i have zero desire to go to school, i have a ton of deadlines and i have not even started it and all i can think about is driving to the high level bridge in my town and jumping. either that or just take an entire bottle of melatonin. i just feel like i can not do everything at once right now... would it be stupid if i dropped out of school so i can just go lay in my room ? because that is what i do when i get home anyways and it is the only thing i look forward to	moderate
i guess i should have seen it coming... after years clean, i relapsed post partum took its toll on me hard... but i have to keep my head up and keep looking forward. even if not for myself, but for my daughter.	moderate

hi, um, breathing is starting to hurt, so please excuse my vent hello everyone! this is my first ti ame on reddit, and i just... really wanted to get my feelings out. i hide and suppress my feelings so i do not have to do this sort of thing, but after the past couple of weeks, i just need to get this off my chest. thank you to everyone in advance who takes the ti ame to listen to my selfish rant, haha. honestly, i do not feel like i am living anymore. i thought that i had my depression under for awhile, but it just spiraled down into the place where i am at right now. everything hurts, and getting out of bed is so much harder than it should be. god, it is stupid, but i am even scared of going to sleep because of my vivid and horrible nightmares. i am so exhausted, but i try and force myself to stay awake regardless. the ti ame spent during my nights is usually crying and, um, cutting my body until i just can not anymore. i was clean for a good two weeks as well, but i relapsed again. it is... actually starting to scare me how much and how deep i cut now... i am just so, so tired. i am trying my best to stay happy and put on a smile, but at this point, death seems like a comfort rather than a fear.. i keep getting those thoughts that maybe it would be better if i just fell asleep and never woke up. just so i wouldn t have to deal with this anymore. i am sorry, this was such a mess of words, haha. it felt nice to actually get it all out though, so thank you again.	moderate
i have no idea where i would be if i did not have my cat she stopped me from crying, self harm, and would in general make me feel good, and that someone loved me which is a feeling i get no where else	moderate
short memoir of my depression i wi will start by saying this has been something i have meant to do for awhile now. during my ti ame with depression i told myself if i ever found my way out of it that i would post my experience so that maybe someone out there who was just like me could stumble upon this and get better at least just a little bit. so this is me sharing my story along with things that really helped me in particular. for most of my life i would have described myself as a happy, opti amistic person. good family, good friends, good life in general. that is not to say my life was free of any emotional hardship. specifically relevant were a couple of ti ames i think i had a couple brief encounters with shorter term depression. in th grade there were a few weeks where i was very low emotionally. feelings of not fitting in, some weird form of bullying. i remember being at my lockers when someone who was something of a friend came over and asked me if i was alright, and that shocked me into realizing i was not feeling alright even though i just deflected with i have just been tired lately. that brief encounter kind of snapped me out of the negative mindset i was in. in that instance i think all i needed was to know some of my peers actually did care about me so i have always been very grateful to that person in a way they are not aware of. the rest of my middle school and high school experience was very good overall. the other brief encounter was just a random day during my freshman year of college. i got back to my dorm after classes on a beautiful friday. so much stuff that i could potentially do, outside activities with friends, online videogames with friends from high school and elsewhere, any number of campus activities. i sat down and was just overwhelmed with this i ammense feeling of boredom. all this opportunity at my fingertips and none of it appealed to me at all. in fact in that moment it felt like there was not anything in the world that would stop this feeling of boredom and that quite nearly brought me to tears. this actually scared me afterwards and over the next few weeks there was an uptick in me going and doing things i thought were productive and fun to make sure i did not feel that feeling again. i was not so lucky as to avoid it forever. flash forward to the start of my senior year of college. i had just wrapped up a typical summer working hard, spent some ti ame camping with my family, and was excited to be back to classes. my friends and i had founded a new club at the university, the classes themselves were engaging, and everything was going great. a couple months in and things just started to, i do not know, slip. the fun of anything i was doing just started to fade out slowly and because of this i started to withdraw from doing them. less and less attentive with the club, less attentive with my social life, less attentive with classes, less attentive with physical fitness. by the end of the semester everything had really slipped, including my grades, and i just felt really burnt out on everything. i kept telling myself that winter break would be the recharge i needed. some ti ame to relax and refocus. of course i did not fully comprehend my situation at the ti ame and was totally wrong. over winter break i had gone back home and spent a large amount of ti ame sleeping resting. even when i was awake i really was not doing much. at one point i had gone down for yet another nap and my mom came down and asked me if anything was wrong. she noticed the slip in my grades, the sleeping, etc. when she did that it made me briefly aware that something was indeed wrong even if i did not know what, but i of course deflected it to just being burnt out from last semester and trying to rest up. by the end of break i told myself that i should have my energy back to really finish strong. for the first month or two of the semester i came out swinging. i was extremely on top of everything, ahead on all my work and getting good grades on it all. back to my normal gym routine. and yet i had this feeling that i was sti will just behind and despite how well i was doing, just unfulfi willed. this was making me uncharacteristically anxious and would cause me to suddenly feel extremely tired. the tiredness led to slipping on things, missing classes and assignments more and more frequently. eventually i had stopped going to classes altogether. shortly after this i had started regularly crying myself to sleep, each ti ame this happened pushing me closer and closer to calling my parents and breaking down to them. they beat me to the punch when i got a knock on my door and it was a police officer doing a wellness check because i had not responded to my parents for awhile. i broke down on the spot. the officer was very respectful and polite and encouraged me to call my parents, and left shortly after i called them. the next day my mom was out at my university, which was no small trip as it was , miles from home. the rest of the week was a whirlwind that shot my stress through the roof. a lot of this was necessary, some of it felt overbearing. i remember getting texts from various people wanting to talk and feeling so exposed, as if my mom had just outed me to everyone regardless of what she actually told them to trigger these responses. she wanted to constantly be around me even though i told her repeatedly that i was not going to self harm and did not feel alone both completely true , and the lack of space did not help anxiety levels. however she also pushed me towards all sorts of necessary meetings. with the dean of students, with student counseling, with professors, with student health. student counseling, at least at first, was somehow the least considerate of my situation. i remember that meeting clearly, the lady doing the consulting talking to my mom and giving off a vibe as if she thought i was just slacking off in my studies due to poor work ethic and thistractions. she did a when i actually started talking about the gradual fade of enjoyment from virtually everything, voice quivering while i was not very successfully fighting back tears, and i ammediately recommended me to student health. the doctor i met with there was much more considerate and recognized the depression right away. more tears were shed, this ti ame from fear, as i faced the realization of being prescribed and ssri and becoming aware of just how much my situation had escalated. with consultation from the dean of students, i did an all withdrawal, packed stored my things, and flew back home. the next year or so was a rough one, and contained the absolute lowest points of my life. i was a shadow of my former self. thinking back to that ti ame a lot of it was a blur of feeling empty punctuated by moments of extreme sadness. even now, when i no longer consider myself depressed, si amply thinking of them to type them out has me tearing up, and when i talk about it out loud my voice breaks and i can no longer hold back the tears. the spring summer which was essentially family camping get together season was very tough. going on camping trips with the fifth wheel which felt like torture as i laid trapped in a setting that i used to love now forced to realize it gives me no pleasure. family events where i felt i was only showing up to show face while spending the rest of the ti ame holding back depressive tears surrounded by loving family and friends. at some point i had started therapy but i was not at all consistent with it. not because it was not good or because i had something against it, just because depression had sapped all my self motivation to engage with it. i would sti will interact with friends but it was extremely taxing. it felt inconsiderate to drag anyone else down with me so i would spend a lot of what little energy i had to sti will interact positively with people around me. only a few people really ever saw how i was actually feeling behind it all. i am sure my friends loosely pieced together some extent of things but i doubt they had any idea of the full picture. like knowing i was subtly lower energy or slightly down in mood, but unaware of the depression specifically. going to sleep eventually only led to dreams where i also felt depressed. long nights of crying from the emotional pain and frustration of my situation. constantly asking myself why do i feel this way and desperately searching for a solution, hurting more and more every ti ame i came up empty handed. strangely enough, it was never really self esteem involved which made it all the more confusing to me. i knew there were many people that cared for me, that i was intelligent, that i have had many good experiences in my life, that i had value as a person. and yet none of that mattered to me and only made it that much more frustrating to feel so miserable. there were a couple of months where i hit my personal rock bottom. i had fully thisengaged from everything in my life, i could not even muster the energy to so much as play a video game. for about two weeks things got exceptionally bad. i was never actively suicidal or thought about self harm, but during those two weeks and maybe some surrounding them i felt to be what i consider passively suicidal. i no longer actually cared to be alive. i hurt all day, and hurt in my dreams. the only relief i had was unconsciousness between rem cycles. i was not going to ki will myself, but the idea of just falling asleep and not waking back up, or just withering away to nothing, appealed greatly to me it took me awhile to type that sentence because of all the powerful feelings it brings up even just thinking about it . for those two weeks i did almost absolutely nothing but lay in bed, either staring at the ceiling or trying to sleep. i barely ate or drank at all, some days not eating anything and the others likely less than calories. if my parents came to check on me, i would quickly pull out my phone and make it appear as if i was at least doing something minuscule then i ammediately putting it away as soon as i was out of their attention. maybe in some way i really needed to hit this point, as shortly after began the slow cli amb out of the pit of my depression. i do not know exactly what it was, maybe just absolutely crippling boredom, but one day not long after that two week period i decided to go back and play a videogame i had started but never finished. may also be in part to having decided to be more consistent with taking my prescribed ssri which i had not been at that point . to me this was the moment things began to i amprove, albeit slowly. it was not much, but it was infinitely better than passively ki willing myself. i slowly started to reengage over the next few months with very basic things like videogames and some of the online friends associated with them, with tv shows movies, streams etc. i sti will largely felt numb while engaged with these things, none of it felt satisfying or truly enjoyable but it at least thistracted me from some of the pain. soon my younger sister sti will in high school started having late night practices multiple ti ames a week which i would provide rides for. because i did not want to waste the gas to drive home just to drive back down and then back again miles from the house to the school it was an easy way to work the gym back into my schedule. soon i was being much more consistent with my therapy sessions and ssri use. i was engaging more with my friends. as things shifted into the summer i was not feeling nearly as low even if i sti will was not experiencing any happiness. i felt stable enough to take an online class to further my already almost finished degree. to me this actually highlighted the current issue i was facing at the ti ame. i was completing everything on ti ame or earlier, getting almost perfect grades, and not feeling exceptionally sad or stressed. however, i was extremely apathetic. an a on a paper or assignment felt meaningless, zero satisfaction where i felt it could have been an f for all it mattered to me. this scared me a lot, and i started reading reddit a lot looking for all sorts of different perspectives on life activities, desperately hoping to find one that appealed to me. and while i learned a lot in general about many different things, the true way out of my depression came from self reflection. at some point i resigned to my apathy anhedonia. never feeling pleasure was a tough pi will to swallow but it was considerably better than emotional pain bringing me to tears on a daily basis. once i accepted it is when things started to drastically change, because i started treating it almost like a super power. i was just so i ampartial to everything that in the same vein that otherwise enjoyable activities did nothing for me, otherwise boring tedious demanding tasks did nothing either as apathetic boredom was the staple of everything i did. so i figured if i can not be happy i could at least be productive. took a part ti ame job, upped my gym fitness routine back to normal, started to live with my grandmother whom, at , needed constant help around her house and with errands. she was passed of a year ago now an incredibly strong woman and one of my biggest role models, and at the same ti ame could be incredibly finicky and stubborn to the point that she would rapidly wear down the patience of her three daughters. i have always been an extremely patient person and my newfound apathy made me perfectly suited to help her on a constant basis. at some point i had also stopped taking any ssris without letting anyone know , as they had helped me get out of that extreme low point but now i had my physical energy and all they were doing was giving me restless energy with no i ampact on my state of mind. eventually i transitioned from weekly therapy sessions to biweekly. i stopped drinking soda entirely, not that it was really li amiting my health, i just figured i got no pleasure from it so now is the best ti ame to drop an unhealthy part of the diet. while i sti will could not feel pleasure and that i was largely just unsatisfyingly going through the motions of life i did feel as though i proved i was stable enough to return for my last semester of college at the start of the next year. my parents and therapist agreed with me, maybe even more so after i revealed to them that i had taken myself off the ssris months beforehand and remained increasingly stable. going back out to college i had fiercely crafted a productive routine consisting of very little besides classes studying, exercise, eating, and sleep. about hrs of sleep, hrs of exercise combination of yoga, weight training, swi amming, and running , hrs of eating to maintain high enough calories for all the exercise , hrs of class studying, and hrs of free ti ame per day more free ti ame on the weekends . every day was packed but it was easy to keep moving as long as i stayed moving because there was not anything that i actually wanted to do that could thistract me. i was also going to group therapy twice weekly, and this is something that i think benefited me i ammensely even now. a lot of cbt along with just being able to talk and share experience with others directly that really aided my ability to feel comfortable with being vulnerable. i became aware that inactivity was a trigger for my depressive feelings. because i was so apathetic, if i stopped moving there was not really any motivation to start moving so to speak, which made the weekends the more dangerous days of the week. it was also a fine balance of trying to determine whether or not it was physical mental exhaustion that legiti amately required rest, or si amply depressive apathetic thoughts pretending to be the same thing. i had created a mental i amage of a physics block diagram that had all the factors of my internal motivation and how depression fit into that. spring break almost caused me to slip out of things entirely due to the sudden week long void in my routine, and the after effects were sti will felt for a few weeks. luckily the gains in vulnerability paid huge dividends with getting myself back on track successfully. even more opti amistic, i had started to get a number of very brief breakthroughs against the anhedonia. the first one almost brought me to tears. i was finishing my last lap on the track and really pushed myself on the last sprint and felt a deep internal focus and drive i had not felt felt for a long ti ame. i was not just pushing myself to be productive, i was pushing myself because i wanted it. i probably would have broke down and cried on the spot but i fought back the tears because i was sti will at the gym. the second ti ame was during a night run and as i came up over a hi will i looked over the town lights from above and at the big starry sky and felt the cool air and just had the brief feeling of legiti amate happiness. something i had not experienced in over two years by that point. because i was all alone i did not even fight the tears this ti ame around and just let them flow as i continued my run. another ti ame was when i had just got done with my evening yoga and was on the way back to my place listening to some comedy online radio station. it was just some dumb joke but i actually laughed out loud at it, which stopped me in my tracks because i realized i actually enjoyed it. each of these little moments were fleeting, only maybe a couple seconds, but they were so incredibly powerful to me. they are sti will incredibly powerful to me, i was in tears yet again just typing them out here. it truly put things into perspective for me of just how starved for happiness i was, and i clung to those tiny moments intensely. the next and maybe biggest challenge was sti will just down the road. while i finished the semester with a strong gpa and walked at commencement, i sti will had to take a summer field course. this meant no access to group therapy. camping out in remote locations working on stressful assignments with little in the way of all they typical comforts from home. this would last for nearly two months. i would not lie, it did make me quite anxious. it was testing a lot of ski wills i had learned prior to my two year break from school and it was a sharp change to go from two group therapy sessions a week to none while removing comfort and increasing stress. and really it turned out to be just what i needed. about weeks in i was starting to regularly experience freedom from my depression. much longer lasting moments of happiness as a more frequent occurrence. anxiety driven by i amposter syndrome subsiding as i started doing exceptionally well on each project. not that my emotional well being was not being tested. there were nights in my tent that i had felt very low and resulted in crying. my grandmother that meant so much to me passed away three weeks into it i sti will got to talk to her on the phone that same day . and even though these challenges came at me it was just more and more proof that i could process them effectively and not get caught in a downward spiral. i finished with straight a is across each section and felt satisfaction finally. i knew somewhere in the field course experience the grip of depression had finally loosened and i felt i was starting to get some space to live. flash forward to now and i feel as though that grip is gone almost entirely, save for in my memories. it is tough to say when i actually felt totally over it. not quite right at the end of the field course but also before the last few months where my life has actually been going exceedingly well. i do know that it wi will always be a part of me, an incredibly i amportant part of me at that. it is something i think about quite often, and doing so typically brings tears quite easily. but they are not tears of sadness or feeling weak, rather tears of knowing the strength that i had to fight a war with such an insidious opponent and come out victorious. i even someti ames think now that i am grateful for it all in retrospect, as i am so much stronger of a person because of it. that if i had the opportunity to go back to the start and magically prevent the depression from ever occurring in the first place, i wouldn t. i know my situation was considerably less severe than that of many others out there. people driven to self harm or suicidal thoughts, depression that has lasted much longer and or that has been coupled other terrible things like abuse anxiety bipolar etc. but i do think that regardless of when you find your way out of it all and you wi will , eventually you ll look back at it with a strange fondness for all of the strength and growth it gave you. how positively it shaped you in the long haul, even if positivity is a far off concept for you now like it was for me. to maybe help some people along this path i would like to share some things that worked really well for me and hopefully they can for you too please, please, please, get help! this is not a battle you want to be fighting by yourself. i assure you that there are so many people that want to see you get better and help you in doing so. many can be complete strangers. for me it was my direct family, my grandmother, my friends even if they did not know the extent of things , my therapist counselors, and so many random people on reddit i never even directly interacted with gave me crucial perspective on life when i needed it most. speaking of, i would feel more than happy to be one of those people to help anyone struggling so do not hesitate to message me if you want to talk. vulnerability. this goes hand in hand with getting help. you are not weak for being vulnerable. you are not weak for seeking help. vulnerability is one of if not the greatest strength i have taken away from my experience with depression and what has helped me the most when fighting back against it. just openly talking about my feelings with others in group therapy was liberating, as was openly listening and accepting the vulnerability of others. when i think back to my lowest points i felt so incredibly weak, but when i think about the moments where i vocalized and shared those feelings i feel so strong. therapy . undoubtedly what ulti amately got me through it all. both one on one therapy and group therapy worked very well for me. everyone can be different though. you yourself might respond better to one type or the other, with one style of therapist or another, with a certain personality of the therapist, with a certain frequency of visits. it is i amportant to spend the ti ame finding the fit that works the best for you. and this fit can change for you over ti ame. i felt like i had kind of capped out on one on one therapy on a biweekly basis after a certain point and switching to group therapy at x the frequency benefited me greatly. however i needed that one on one ti ame to even get to a point where the group therapy could be beneficial to begin with. for you it might be the opposite, or it might just be wildly different. whatever you feel comfortable with and works. medication. the idea of being put on an ssri was terrifying to me in a lot of ways. it crystallized the severity of my situation and the idea of taking drugs to intentional alter my mind was not appealing to me. i had an off and on relationship with my consistency taking them. it was definitely necessary to get out of the lower depths of my depression. and as my depression evolved so did my medication needs. if i was more consistent with my medication it might have sped along my journey. while going off of them towards the end was ulti amately the right call it was admittedly quite risky to do that without consultation first and i would not recommend my behavior in that case. like therapy, it is very i amportant to find that right fit of medication, whether it is none at all or some developed combination of ssris you and you psychiatrist have determined over ti ame. engagement. as depressive thoughts would take hold of me i would thisengage more and more from different things in my life. it always felt easy, even like the right thing to do, under the excuse of just being tired. in reality it was the opposite, i was not truly tired, and the more i thisengaged the easier it was to get pulled by depression. it was slowly reengaging with things, even if the happiness was gone from them or di aminished greatly, that triggered my recovery and eventually led to moments of lucidity long term. that is not to say you should just jump back to everything in your life all at once. i know that would have overwhelmed me and cause more of a backslide. just a gradual reintroduction of things you used to enjoy and maybe some new things you have found along the way. maybe a si ample routine and some light responsibility that you can steadily add to as you feel comfortable. things to keep you moving and not trapped in place where depression wants you. positive reframing. if i had to mark the point where i really started to fight back against depression it would be when i reframed how i thought about my anhedonia. i found the silver lining to what otherwise felt like an incredibly hopeless situation. making peace with potentially never being able to obtain happiness again so i could then focus on at least being productive. like i mentioned before, i became mindful of it almost as a super power. i could not do anything to make myself happy so i no longer concerned myself with that. on the flipside i could do incredibly boring but highly productive things seemingly endlessly and not feel any different than doing something i would have otherwise enjoyed. my happiness was no longer in my direct control so i put my attention on what was, and that was productivity. smiling. this last one might sound a little weird, but someti ames its the small and odd things like this that can really help someone. i was doing a lot of outside work during cold winter months and was frequently wearing a facemask. at some point i started just putting an almost loony smile on my face underneath as i worked without fear of looking like a weirdo and without actually feeling happy either. overti ame it did feel as though just doing that would lead to small upticks in mood. nowhere near happy but it added to the slowly building positive buffer keeping me from sinking back down. so that is my story when it comes to my depression, from start to end. doing this has been something i had meant to do for awhile now, as far back as when i was only starting to truly overcome it. some of the most beneficial things to me during that dark ti ame was reading different perspectives of people whom had faced their depression and come out the other side for the better so it only feels right that i pay it forward now. anything i have spent thinking about writing this, actually writing this, and shedding tears on this would be i ammediately worth it if only a single person finds something even marginally useful out of it all. do not hesitate to comment on this or message me directly if you want to talk. thiscussing depression is never going to be a burden to me because i choose not to let it be so. i also encourage others like me, whom have made it out of the tunnel, to share your own experience. nobody should

awkward mess hello fellow depressed people and supporters. i do not know if the way i experience depression is the same as you all do but here is what is got me hating life and wanting to ki will myself.... i am years old and in college. i basically uprooted my whole life to come here because i wanted to get away from my family and friends because they did not understand me and i just generally felt weird and like i did not fit in. well, big surprise i sti will feel the exact same here, except worse. on top of that i have lost contact with my dearest friends from high school, my gf broke up with me, and when my family does check in on me its really short and not meaningful at all. i just never really connected with anyone including my family and i have always kept this habit of acting like everything is okay because i do not believe anyone would help me or care if i was not. people see me as super friendly and outgoing because i am at first but every ti ame after that i do not really know how to maintain a friendship and i just do not trust that anyone would make me a part of their life unless they were forced to. if i were to open up to anyone they would just say something like wow that sucks. it is crazy you got through all that. but i really have not. any ti ame it is ti ame to express myself in class by writing a story, making a poem, drawing a picture, or making up a business that solves a problem that i really care about, i get triggered. all i can think about in those situations is my troubled past and i do not dare bring those experiences up or even allude to them in a classroom setting. and it really sucks because i want to express myself, but when the ti ame comes i just stop myself from presenting because i am too embarrassed of my life to talk about it. i just feel so thisconnected from my life day to day. i feel like i am waiting for my real friends to appear, a place where i really feel like i am home, a passion that i am actually passionate about. i walk around thinking wow, is this really it? i just generally feel like my life has slipped through the cracks and who would stop and help someone who has slipped through the cracks unless they were paid to. who wants that energy around them unless they are getting paid? it is all in my head and i want to change but i keep coming back to depression and every ti ame i do it feels like this feeling would not ever go away. i feel like i accidentally fucked my whole life up, and it was supposed to be great, but because i was stubborn, because i hid from my feelings, because i do not know how to express myself it is a living hell and the fact that i am missing out on a healthy happy life makes me so angry i want to ki will myself for being such an idiot and cheating my way out of a wonderful life. i know it is not too late for me... i really want to see a therapist but until then you guys are the best thing i have got so thanks for reading if you did. sorry if this was ramble y hopefully someone out there can relate and understand what i mean.	moderate
my depression ki wills me everyday. i just hope it takes my life away. to live in constant pain sucks. i barely have any friends who are there for me. i have generally had a hard life. my father burned my family is for the sake of his own family and his enjoyment. i had struggled for a really long ti ame before i met a woman i fell in love with in . i loved her so deeply but she left me after years because i was just the replacement to her ex. she burned me to get back with her ex. my years went down the drain. everything i thought was true thisappeared. people keep leaving me in my life. i am kinda left with no happiness in my life. i have no urge to live either but i am living to help my family as they need me. i just hope i get cancer and die sooner. i really do not know how long wi will i be able to carry on with this pain .	moderate

i am going to explode i feel like ive lost the last person i can open up to by pushing them away. i can not see myself living past and dont know who to tell or how. i just have that feeling, my deadline is . i dont care how it happens i just have to be gone before that. i can not see myself in the future and while i may have some happy days i always know its temporary and i sti will feel my sadness creep back in, which makes me feel so guilty. i dont know how to open up my feelings and feel like i wi will never have anyone to talk to again. how do i get out of this hole i dug myself in. i can not see myself in the future but i am too scared to try right now. i just want lightning to strike me down.	moderate
what should my goal be if i value nothing? i have been depressed for a long ti ame. i have tried to ki will myself twice, but i was not trying hard enough. now i know i can not wi willfully die, because of the consequences that befall the people that do not want me to. i live with the guilt of the pain i have caused in trying to take my own life. being in a position where i do not want to live, but can not die is a terrible purgatory. so, to sum it up, i have been ai amless. i tried to figure some short term solutions to this purgatory. at first i figured i wanted to lose my virginity, so i lost weight and i tried to socialize. my efforts are futile. i spent most of high school alone, after depression kicked in. i never learned friendship or love or sex. ai amless. i felt like a good for nothing freak. so i tried to find a part ti ame job. with enough money saved, i could maybe afford a trip to pattaya or amsterdam and pay prostitutes to lose my virginity and teach me how to pleasure. with only insurance bi wills to pay i sti will live with parents , i might be able to do it. after some ti ame working, and thinking, i have concluded that by trying to buy prostitutes, i am putting my desire to feel wanted and sexual above the rights of women not to be trafficked and raped. i can not in good conscience keep trying to buy my own virginity. ai amless again. for the past few years, i figured i should try and get a degree. i dropped out of a year university the second ti ame i tried to ki will myself, so i enrolled at a community college. i am finishing an associates degree in architectural engineering this semester as long as coronavirus does not delay . but i have found that i do not really care for what i am learning, and along with that, my degree is useless in actually becoming an architect or civil engineer. so, once again, ai amless. i do not know what i should strive for. i do not have any real goals. i have been seeing a therapist recently, but therapy has never really changed the deep down feeling that i am undesirable, alone, and worthless. i feel like a dead man walking. i wish i was already dead. i wish no one depended on me. i wish no one cared about me. i wish i never existed. sorry, this started out hopeful, even though i am tearing up, i sti will want to leave on a hopeful note. to any of you if i value nothing, what should my goal be? what do i ai am for next?	moderate
is it safe to assume that someone who is depressed but going to counseling and on medication is okay? meaning that i should not ask or talk about the topic as they seek to i amprove their condition? i only ask because i was told about them attending a psychiatrists therapist i do not know the difference...? as well as my friend is clincally depressed. she is not out of work per se but her employer is not able to pay her considering that she started a new job but she has not gotten to even do her first day so she is not getting paid at all. she is pulled out loans to help with rent due to the furlough but typically she is hard to reach and we mostly talk via work. i sorta am worried she wi will withdraw isolate and while i feel bad about her situation i fear more about her lack of contact.	moderate
how is the older crowd dealt with depression for most of their life? i have had depression anxiety too for as long as i can remember, years. been on and off medication and seen a therapist since i was . been diagnosed and gotten through serval mental thisorders. gone through several types of therapy, hospitalized a couple ti ames, missed out on so much... life. i have gotten better, but only compared to how i was. as i have gotten older i have noticed that years of therapy and i am sti will severally depressed and struggling. i have just learned to function with it and just survive. how have those that have gone through it most of their life is keep moving forward when the light at the end of the tunnel does not get closer?	moderate
life, is not for everyone i do not even know where to begin with this. but just life is a thisaster. the mental pain, consumes me everyday. getting to me. the thought of chelsea is always there. i gave my all to her, she was always first, i did so much for her, always made sure she was okay..... she never did the same for me, never ever. she was my priority. i gave her so many chances, but she kept destroying those. made a lot of promises to, to me about how she loved me, wi will not get with anyone, but sti will did. lied to me, destroyed my heart. going through one of the worst heart breaks ever at the moment. i can not stop thinking about her. just the thought of her with someone else ki wills me inside, i know she does not know this is on my mind. this is all i think about. does not help that suicide is always there as well. knowing there is always another way out helps. just overdose...... life does not matter anymore. life is not for everyone . so many ti ames i nearly have, but backed out at the last second. i really do not know why, i truely, truely do not know what is stopping me sti will. school found out about all the suicidal shit, called my mum. told her everything. had to tell my dad as well. i think they think i am a danger, school thinks it as well.... school is not doing a single thing to help, just put it all on me and my parents. i do not know how much longer i can take this mental pain. depression, anxiety. everything, what is the point. when all these haunt my body. everybody thinks i am happy but i am not, here is my confession. sti will love chelsea so much, but, do not think she feels the same. too caught up in this other guy. i do not know if she is going to message me, i do not know if i want her to, to be honest. if she does, might just send her this paragraph. she wi will know how i feel. my family life is okay at the moment i guess. i am just unlucky as hell. having been sick for so long, got a concussion as well from a friend, all while i found out chelsea got with someone else. i can not take this anymore, crying writing this. savannah, eva, nikita, spencer all worried for me. but i do not want them to be. i know i wi will be okay in the end. no matter what happens to me. might go out on my own terms. depression has destroyed my mental state. i do not see myself recovering from it ever. lost so many friends, depended on people too much. maybe, i was the problem in my last relationship with her. maybe she did not do anything wrong. was i too dependent on her? did i try too much? was i obsessive? i do not know anymore. maybe i wi will never find out. i love you so much. i do not want anyone else . nooo joel, i would not get with someone else in chaing mai. i love you, and only you . hopefully the mental pain stops soon. do not think it wi will. considering while writing this, just to take my own life tonight, tomorrow, whenever. i do not even know care. i have no interest in life anymore. no interest in anything. just wish i was dead to be honest. wouldn t have to deal with all of this mental pain anymore. wish my family understood how i felt, and just, just let me go. i do not care if it is selfish. it is selfish to give my all to this world and sti will feel like nothing, sti will feel like a waste of ti ame, money, space, oxygen. whatever. because that is what i am. i do not deserve any of this i have. that is what makes me feel worse as well. getting what most kids, what most people work their whole life is for, and sti will just wanting to be dead. someti ames i just, i wonder what i would feel like to be walking to my bus stop and getting hit by a car, a truck, whatever. just, all the pain. gone in a split second. sounds nice, really does. i do not care what happens to me next, just as long as death happens. i can not i amagine being alive for another, , even years. scares me to think i am going to be around for a long ti ame. going to make sure that does not happen. drinking and taking drugs to forget the pain, half the ti ame i can not get this shit out of my head. just always drowning in my own thoughts, pain, whatever.	moderate
my personal struggles i just have to let this out because i never express my feelings. i have dealt with depression and anxiety for some ti ame now. at ti ames it feels like the depression just has a hold on me and it would not loosen. but i need to escape because i need to live out my dreams. i set gals and dreams that i desperately want to achieve but the depression just holds me back i get lazy and do not want to leave my bed because it is somewhat of a safe haven. the anxiety makes it even harder for me to deal with. when it comes to dreams my anxiety shoots it down every minute and i just can not shake it. for me this is all sti will foreign to me. i do not know how to deal with it. i wear sweatshirts because they comfort me. i chew gum to help me relax. someti ames i smoke to help me relax. i want to cuddle to know that someone actually and truly likes and loves me for who i am. i have never been able to find myself again and i am sti will lost, lost in my thoughts and lost in this world. everything is so difficult for me to wrap my head around it. i am losing myself everyday. i feel like i never fit in and like nobody likes me. at school it may seem like i am a happy kid who always smiles no matter what. but that is just because i know what it feels like to go through pain and if my smile helps somebody get through pain throughout that day then i wi will keep smiling. but i sti will hurt. it may seem like i am popular at school and everyone knows me but they do not know the real me that struggles daily. i have dreams that i want to achieve but can i really achieve them. this world is so big and so large and unpredictable could my dreams that i have had for years now be accomplished wi will all the stars align for me to make this possible. or wi will everything that i work towards and want just thisappear and i fade into the cold harsh reality that is life. my dreams are the only thing that keep me alive and if i lose that than i honestly have nothing to live for	moderate
i am trash my depression is starting to become very bad. i would not talk to people. i can not. it just feels like they would not understand or agree and i am tired of feeling alone in this world. i hate this world and the people of it. growing up a a child my mother never asked about my problems or spoke to me about how to fix them.. she would just pray with me or tell me to go pray about it.. that is basically where me being closed off comes from. my girlfriend is getting cold shoulders and basically ignored all day. she talks to me and it is like i can not respond in a bright manner. i hate this shit. i can only assume it is the reflection of self hate and non existence of my self esteem. my girlfriend compli aments me, loves me, supports me, all while she has depression herself. she literally supported me for a year with no job and i can not push past this shit to return the favor? i am legit trash. i already know and i am sick of it. every day i think about just ki willing myself because i do not believe i wi will be able to support myself in the future, keep a job, etc. and i do not want to leave my girlfriend like that. i do not want to do her dirty that way. i do not understand why i am such a piece of shit. i am sorry this is everywhere and i do not know if it makes sense but i sat here typing and deleting other posts because i am depressed and anxious. even now i expect nothing but negative judgement and no one to understand where i am coming from or how to help me. it is hard not to say a lot when you finally get a chance to be heard..	moderate
i have the least amount of hope i have ever had i kind of just want to write this out right now because i do not feel like writing it down in my journal and i do not know where else to. basically what the title says. i have never felt so hopeless about everything. the world is such an ugly place and i do not really see anything getting better. if anything, everything just keeps getting worse the longer i am alive. i have friends but it does not always feel like they are there for me in the way i want them to be. i have never been in an actual good relationship that was not toxic and detri amental to my wellbeing, i do not even know what that feels like. and when i thought i finally found someone who i could potentially have an actual good relationship with, they fucking turned on me and acted like they never liked me and barely even said goodbye they left in such a haste. i am bisexual and nonbinary afab and this combination of existing makes life so hard. not because of the identities themselves, but because it is so unbearably obvious how normal being these things are and most people do not understand them or even think that they are made up for attention and mental i willnesses. i do not trust anyone anymore. all i want to do is give love to people and be loved back but no one wants to. all anyone ever does it hurt me and thiscard me in such cruel, unnecessarily ugly ways. why is it so easy for them to treat me as they do? it is excruciating beyond words to exist as i do in a world like this. i am genuinely not sure how much more of this i can take.	moderate

yesterday i tried to ki will myself i wrote everyone i care about notes, left instructions and also codes for my bank account. took some pi wills and went to the bathroom and i cut myself. as i was bleeding i got really scared. i did not want to die alone or at least not like this. i regretted my decision. i crawled out of the bathroom and had to turn on my phone. bless the emergency call button. i was already feeling to weak from all the blood loss but i managed to call an ambulance for myself. my friend arrived before the ambulance. i feel awful that she had to see that. i was taken to the hospital but they did not keep me there because they have no room. now i am staying with my friend somewhere. i guess what i am trying to say is that do not make decisions like that on an i ampulse. try to calm down. take your ti ame!!	moderate
numbness hi, m here. does anyone else get this feeling that is hard to describe? it is like you re not happy but you re not entirely sad either, you re just...numb? it almost feels like you re on autopilot. i have been struggling with this since i graduated in . reading books, playing video games, going outside. these are the things that i used to enjoy but now i just do not really enjoy them anymore. i spend a lot of my ti ame just staring at my computer screen trying to figure out something that ll entertain me but it is just the same shit over and over. i keep telling myself that everything wi will get better but i honestly do not know where to start. the only ti ame i feel happy is when i am out with my close friends. i feel like i spend a lot of my ti ame in my head just overthinking shit like my appearance and what others think of me. when i am out, it feels like it is all eyes on me. people say that i am too quiet and monotone. i feel really bad about myself right now and i just want my emotions back. tired of feeling numb.	moderate
why does depression have to be so shitty depression is so shitty someti ames. like one moment you can be feeling okay or almost happy, and then bam out of nowhere you start to feel exhausted and incredibly sad. like this deep intense depression where you feel like you need to curl up into a little ball and cry. like the pain is so intense you feel like nothing can take it away and you just wish you did not feel that way anymore. it is honestly so horrible. i just wish it did not creep up out of nowhere on me and effect me like this. it is one of the worst feelings in the world and when i think about others who are less fortunate than me, i feel even shittier and hate myself even more for even having depression and wasting so much ti ame feeling this way. i just wish i was not like this. i wish the depression would just fuck off and go away and leave me alone. i just want to be normal and contribute to society and not take things for granted but depression just likes to slowly sweep over me and completely blindside me and make me feel like shit. it makes me feel like i am a terrible person for even feeling this way at all when there are other people out there that expereince much worse than me. i wish i could just get better. i feel like crying right now. 	moderate

i think it is ti ame i have been struggling for a while now. although daily achievements are made someti ames, i feel like i am gradually just sinking deeper into this void. i am not sad anymore, just tired. i really do not see it getting any better. i know the future holds promising things for me i am a med student but nothing is guaranteed, and even then this crippling pain makes a career seem insignifican not. i have family, some good friends, who i love dearly and who have been so supportive. i am aware i shut them out. i do not want them to feel what i do, i wouldn t wish this on anyone. my husband left on vacation for a few days and i think now is the ti ame to do the deed.	moderate
one of the most painful things is witnessing people who have hurt me, even damaged me permanently, live their best life while i am miserable and afraid. i can not sleep. i can barely think someti ames. i do not know who i am and i do not know how to be better. my mother is ex husband, who i sti will have nightmares about years later, is enjoying his life. he never thinks about me, but every night i see his face. my parents, who never even acknowledge me anymore live every day happy as can be without me, the living culmination of all of their mistakes, with their families. even though i dread loving everyone for what they have done, the heart is always reaching for that feeling like i need to belong somewhere. but i do not fit. i am piece from a different puzzle. i am an alien. and while everyone happily moves on without me, i am stuck here where i am the only one suffering for what they have done. they all have wonderful lives that i can not be a part of. they all have life figured out, like everything wonderful was handed to them. i am uglier, poorer, sadder, and more lost every day than the one before. it is not fair to be the damaged one. i am not supposed to be the one that sti will suffers. i feel so much pain... i worry that god has failed me by rewarding monsters. this suffering has me convinced. i do not belong anywhere but hell. why was i ever born?	moderate
nothingness just venting here i guess. i do not feel like i am ever really going to amount to anything. i have many things i want to do, but i have absolutely zero patience for any of it. books, tv, playing instruments, drawing, painting, learning new things, relationships... i just do not have it in me to take the ti ame to develop things. i wi will carry books around with me that i want to read, but my brain just goes, if we can not pretty much absorb all the wisdom from this book through osmosis, then fuck it. i wi will read a little bit. maybe get to page . but it is difficult and ti ames i get bored and stop reading it. i feel no connection to tv at all, it is just staring at a screen watching the screen flash and people interacting and talking. but i have no idea what is going on and i could not care less to know. they might as well be speaking a different language. even when i get the rare desire to draw, in the end it does not really feel rewarding. more like, that looks cool. glad that is finally done. i do not want to take the ti ame to learn the basics of anything, i want to learn beethoven before the nursery rhymes. i wanted to teach myself calculus before i made it to algebra . i get frustrated with uncertainty that is involved in relationships and end up cutting people off. i know it takes ti ame to develop a friendship, but in my mind i am already on level before we have even gotten to know each other, and you re in all likelihood not. then i feel like i am swi amming in an ocean rather than a pool, with no shore in sight, it feels pointless and i just want to throw it all away. idk. everything bores me. i just want to hit fast forward on everything. nothing really feels rewarding. so i just kinda sit here like a zombie on my phone, rereading old texts, looking at old pictures, looking at memes, mindless stuff. getting nothing done. it feels like my head empties out more and more. i do not see how this is ever going to change. it is like i am in a vacuum.	moderate

every ti ame i feel like my life is getting better it i ammediately gets worse it almost feels like the universe is punishing me for feeling happy or less depressed rather . every single ti ame something good happened in recent years it was followed by something bad that negates the good thing. like say i got what i wanted, but hold on, wait a couple of days and this wi will be taken from me, or something unrelated happens. maybe it is an actual thing the universe wants to balance itself, so for every good thing you get a bad one? in any case, this makes me very scared to feel happy or glad in general. i am afraid that if i feel happy, the universe wi will know and wi will make something happen that would cancel the good thing out. it sucks so much. there are countless special examples that i could give, but it happens every ti ame without a fail. clearly this does not do anything good for my mental health. i struggle a lot as it is, but when good things are taken away, there is nothing left. just a hole. i just think well, what did you expect? you can not have a good life, you can not have good things, just admit it and stop trying . i am suicidal and it makes me even more so. it has been very difficult to stop myself from taking actions to try and kms when life just throws this stuff at me continuously. thanks for reading. if anyone has noticed or experienced something si amilar, please share, i would really appreciate it.	moderate

running out of steam. again. the very act of trying to stay positive and motivated to fight back the consequences of a year long awful period drains all energy. there is very little energy and ti ame left to do something actually productive which ends up fueling even more problems. i have so little left to make up for the lost ti ame, fallen so far behind everyone else that it is starting to derail whatever progress i made in the last months. add to that constant thoughts of self criticism, what life could have been if i was not a piece of shit and things start looking all gri am again.	moderate
all i can do is think about my past. i have tried getting help. the more i think about my past, the more guilty i become of the things i could have done to prevent it from happening. i am tired of feeling like shit. i just want to be happy again. most of my nights are spent crying asking why i was chosen to suffer. i am only . this is just too much to handle. i am afraid that one day my depression and thoughts wi will win and i wi will do something stupid.	moderate
venting a bit, very long not really sure how to start this, so i guess i wi will just get into it. also possibly trigger warning? i feel like it may be unnecessary on a sub like this, but i feel a need to say it with what i wi will get into. side note, pretty much all of my way of writing is through online messages, so i my sentences may be a bit run on at ti ames or seem to end in strange places, and have just general bad grammar. can anyone else not i amagine getting older at all? i am honestly a pretty young person, just turning a few months ago, and i can not see myself getting to age at all, hardly even to . even if i try to i amagine my life being the best it could be, i can not see myself living a good life until my s, s, and especially not older. i do not even really know what my best life is either, i hardly have any wi will to do pretty much anything now, and anyti ame i attempt to do something i want to try, i mess it up and feel worse than if i did nothing at all. i do not even feel any fear about dying, the only things i am scared of are the possible pain, and being sad about the small amount of people who care about me. which i find pretty stupid since why do i care, i wi will be dead anyways. but i do and the pain and few people i have are pretty much the sole reason for me to stay alive, which i hate since that is a terrible thing to do to someone. i can not just hold onto people who care about me to keep me alive for my entire life. because they would not be here forever, especially with the way i treat them by being like this. and at the rate that i am going, i am not even sure if i wi will fear the pain anymore with how bad i feel, there comes a point where the mental pain is bad enough to outweigh any physical pain. i am even kind of getting there now, i do not really get very sick, but any ti ame i do get sick i highly prefer that to any of the mental things i go though. i started a medication a few weeks ago, and i am not sure if it is just because i can not handle things well and have not had to deal with real side effects in my life so far, but it went bad for me. i was pretty tired the morning i took it since i was up all night, after sleeping the day before, so i fell asleep about an hour after i took it. but hours later i woke up in my bed, feeling extremely dizzy just lying down, then i got up and rushed to the bathroom and puked, and i never puke. the last ti ame i did was probably years ago when i made the mistake of choosing to sit up when i had blood drawn, making me lightheaded and eventually throw up. and through the rest of the day it was a little difficult to breathe for nearly the entire day, yawning making me unable to breathe at all for around a second, deep breaths too. my face, hands, and feet got very pale during the first few hours after i woke up too, along with random sweating at ti ames. a few other regular physical side effects, and that was that entire day. but sti will that day i would rate as infinitely better than any of my bad depression days, some days i even have the urge to take one again just for the hell of it. and after that experience, i think that i am completely done with these medications for depression. this is the third i have taken and after previous ones which did absolutely nothing for me, neither regular effects nor side effects, then this, i am done with them. i feel like therapy and counselling also can not help me at all, i am just not in a mental position for it to do anything of meaning at all. i need things to actually happen, not to sit in a room with someone i do not even know while they tell me things to do which i do not feel a wi will to do at all. i would need something big to happen to shock me out of this hole i am in, give me any sort of reason to go on with things. and the weird thing is is i am not all doom and gloom about everything, i am not some, nothing matters, what is the point of anything, everything is going to go away anyways i am just like, okay, and? about that kind of stuff, i feel no dread or hopelessness about it. i am a weird person with that, it is like i am almost at the point of being content in life, yet at the same ti ame i am almost at the point of ending everything due to how terrible i feel. school for me was pretty much terrible, i do not remember much about the first few years, but up until around grade i had a few people you could kind of call friends, but even by that point the amount was dwindling. then i changed schools in grade because we moved, and i did not make a single friend at that school, i had not at my old one since grade either. i did have a neighbour whose house i went to a lot, but honestly, it was all to play games at his house since all we had was a ps with a couple games and an n with a few games, with a crap computer and absolutely terrible internet. meanwhile he had a ps , and a computer that could run games i could not i amagine my computer running, so of course i went over there to play games. at school i would spend recess literally just standing or sitting at a wall because i did not have a single person i could even call an acquaintance. it got to a point where in grade the teacher told me i could just stay inside for recess, and in grade too after a few weeks. grade i would probably say is the last good year of my life, i was sti will very sad a lot of the ti ame, but compared to now i was the cheeriest person on the planet. high school is when shit really hit the fan for me though, i never showed up, i probably missed around a fifth of the days, i missed many many days in school before that, it kept getting progressively worse since grade . grade was probably the weirdest year there, i got much worse than how i was the previous year but i was not anywhere as near as bad as after that. but after things went downhi will real fast, grade i failed nearly half of my classes, but due to the way high schools work here i went on to grade , but i needed to get those grade credits before i could graduate, and grade i failed every single class i took there was not a single credit i gained that year, then i went on to grade , which i hardly even had any grade classes for, then i went back for another year, and another year. and by that point i was , so i did not need to even get all of those credits anymore, all i needed was specific ones from grade to graduate, so i have not even properly completed high school like the regular kids. the school never punished me for missing as much as i did either, which certainly set me up for failure with how i view working in my life. and i get that i am just a whiny baby but i can not think of a single job that i would do and not feel terrible doing. i hear people say, but when you start making money that ll get you to do it, so you can do the things you want to do. but i do not want to do anything. having a job to make money would do what? even if i had something i wanted to do, the amount of stress i would feel every day from it, making me depressed and anxious constantly would put me in no position to want to do them. and i can not just get a job in something i like , i am hardly interested in anything in the first place and if i did any of them as an actual job i would almost instantly start to despise it because adding the needs of a job to something i like would make it like anything else. all this makes me feel even worse because what gives me the right to feel like this over something as si ample as a job, nearly every single other person has to deal with this shit and just does it, even if it stresses them out they trudge on with it and just do it. but here i am sitting on my ass feeling bad because what, life is stressful? tough shit, it is for everyone else too, why should i feel like this. not to mention that i am trans, even if i sorted every single other thing in my life out, there is that too, and there is nothing you can do to get rid of that. and maybe i could have not been if my childhood had been different. i also grew up mostly without a dad, he was in my life for the first few years, but not long enough to form memories, then he came back for around years, but one day just left out of the blue, not a single person knew where he went. so all i have had around for most of my life was my mom, she did not get with any other guy either so it was just her, me and my brother, who i have a pretty tenuous relationship with. i would say after my dad left we were solidly lower middle class, things were pretty hard since my mom got laid off her job after years when the place closed down, which was not long before he left us. around age , my dad was gone at that ti ame my mom dropped me off with someone to babysit me, i remember her being around her late teens or something, i do not remember much because i was . but i do remember that she made me finger her, you know. even now in text it is hard for me to say it. but that moment is the most clear memory of my life, especially that far back, i remember the room, what she was wearing, and how confused, weird and awkward i felt from it. when my mom came to pick me up from there i told her and she went livid, rightfully so. i have not told her i remember so i think she might just think i forgot about it, but i certainly have not. my mom was also so giving to me too, but i wouldn t say overprotective because she never kept me from doing things, she just let me do whatever, even when doing whatever was the last thing i needed. you need to thiscipline your kids, not too much but you need to. i only remember being spanked a few ti ames in my childhood, i do not even remember what for, my mom once did the classic soap in mouth for swearing, and that got me to never swear in my life until age , not so much as a shit or ass left my mouth. but that is it, i never had chores as a kid, i never had an enforced sleep ti ame, though i did often sleep at the right ti ame at a younger age, but the older i got the later i stayed awake. she never grounded me, never took away anything when i misbehaved, she let me just eat whatever i wanted, which led to me getting very overweight, i have gotten less so but, i sti will am. at this point it is nothing to do with her anymore, i am an adult i should get my own shit in check but i just do not. i get why did this though, it is just her, since the man she was with for over years and had kids with left without a word, not wanting to be bad to your kids. but there is a difference from treating your kids badly and giving them thiscipline and teaching them manners. i often wonder if it is because of all these things that i am trans, maybe i had a certain prethisposition to being this way, then with a mom who gave too much, no dad, and being technically molested at around years old, that it made me this way. i feel like my childhood was average, or even better than most in this part of the world, but then i think about how things were, and think, well pretty sure that is not a normal thing yet i sti will continue to tell myself it was since my mom was nice to me, probably too much. this is probably entirely word vomit and i do not know if i made much sense here, just jumping all over the place, but just need to vent this somewhere, i already make my friends deal with me enough to drop more conversations like this on them. there is probably more that i am not writing about here, but this is long enough and i have spent more than hours to try figure out what to write and how to make this as possible to understand as it can be. i did fail pretty much every single english class after all. i do not expect anyone to help with this, and i probably would not respond to things if someone does, but i wi will certainly read every comment that is made on this. and if anyone actually read all this, i do not know why you chose to spend your ti ame reading all this, but props to you.	moderate

graduated uni only to sink into crippling depression a little while before graduation i got i will and by graduation i became very i will. to cut it short, something as si ample as having a meal turned into a struggle for me. i no longer feel as if i can sti will enjoy the basic joys of human existence. i think the feelings of weakness and thisappointment triggered this depression. when i graduated, i felt so lost and out of place, i have no idea where to go from here and this is very devastating to me since i am something of an overachiever and a perfectionist. i feel like i have to do something useful and productive in my life like everyone else but i have no idea what to do nor do i feel like i want to do anything. now, i am in a rut. seriously considering suicide i have been depressed a lot before but i never contemplated suicide as realistically as i am doing now since my health is only deteriorating and my future does not look too promising, i feel that there is no point in continuing. i know there are people who have it much worse and sti will somehow manage to pull through, but this is me, i have reached my li amit or so i seem to think i have no one to reach out to, i do not have many friends and to be honest, i find it really difficult to explain this to my friend even though i know she would understand but what is the point? i do not want someone to try and cheer me up or tell me this is just phase that wi will end soon. it does not feel like a phase and i am afraid for myself because i have never felt so bleak and so low.	moderate

chronic loneliness over the years, i have kind of lost touch with people. i stopped caring about making friends and spent all of my ti ame at home. i did not want to be let down by people, or backstabbed. and i certainly did not want to deal with fake people and be hurt again by friends i thought i had. now, as a senior in high school, i have been experiencing such horrible loneliness these past couple of years. i present myself as someone who prefers to be alone and a pure introvert to people, but deep down, i someti ames want close friends. or at least someone who would come around more frequently and check in. someone who i have a close, pure connection with. i do have one best friend, but they are often too busy to chat long with me. i have not spoken to them in a few months and it hurts they are out of state . then, there is people at my school who i can never grow close to or trust. and that is what sucks, i have such bad trust issues and it is so hard for me to open up to people. i have tried before in the past, but i end up regretting it when they clearly show they are not interested in helping or have better things to do. well, i do not want to make friends now. not when the school year is so short and i do not plan on going to college, so i do not believe that i wi will even have the ti ame to have a good friend. i am told i need to reach out and try making friends, but i si amply can not. i suck at socializing and these walls have not broken down in forever. i am at such a loss. figured i would come on here and hear some thoughts. anyways, that is where my life is at right now.	moderate

i can not do this anymore. years and i am sti will a fucking wreck. does not matter what i do, what i say, or how i act... no one ever loves me or accepts me. i am a waste of oxygen. the biggest issue is anything involving socializing. grew up homeschooled so my social ski wills are extremely poor and i have social anxiety. i never know what to say and its making things very hard. my personality is hidden underneath tons and tons of anxiety. i have had gli ampses of my true personality and it is something that i am actually proud of, but it is rare when i am anxiety free and i can see that side of me. i have no funny stories, achievements, hobbies, talents, my childhood was very boring and i just do not relate to people my age. i am lonely as hell and that is why i want to die. i can not maintain friendships or relationships very long. i do not know how to deepen them so they fade away into irrelevancy. people get bored. without people, life is not worth living and this is something i just can not seem to get over. after a rough night with my thoughts i woke up this morning more suicidal than ever and i am afraid i actually might do it this ti ame.	moderate

i have lost my way in life. for some context. at the end of my year relationship had unfortunately ended abruptly as i was in the process of moving out to my own place. emotionally confused and damaged. i had a toxic rebound relationship and within a couple of weeks of that i had a seizure and was diagnosed with epilepsy. for most of i have been working on myself, getting therapy, going away on vacation on my own. and generally trying to better my life. which has worked to an extent. as of now i have hit a slump and have no idea what to do. i feel like i am just wondering ai amlessly through the doors at the monsters inc factory. with no purpose. i feel absolutely lost, lonely and down in the dumps. for example, it takes a huge amount of mental effort to wash up or to put my clothes in the washing machine. everything is a mess. it is even difficult to be honest with my therapist because i would rather swallow my misery.	moderate
i think i have aspergers but nobody believes me i have only seen three therapists and two psychiatrists in my life. all of them keep diagnosing me with anxiety ... i can see why. i guess i am fairly anxious. but honestly, i am so depressed. the depression is absolutely profound. and more than that... i am pretty sure i have aspergers. it is so hard for me to socialize. and this is where my thispute of the anxiety diagnosis comes in honestly, i wouldn t say i am really that anxious. big crowds do not scare me, neither do strangers. but i am so bad at social interaction. i really do not know why but it seems like whenever i join a new circle, there is some woman who hates me and starts spreading rumors about me. for some reason, this actually only started happening when i was about in elementary, middle and early high school, i always had a few close friends, and was like on good terms with everyone else i was not super popular, but everything was great. i had my friends and i was never bullied or anything... my junior senior year of high school, things started to get a little weird. my friends were sti will loyal, but i would just catch weird, hateful glances from girls i did not even know. in pretty much every work environment, i was just hated. it was always women who hated me, but people say that women are more sensitive and relational or whatever. that aspergers is like, a male brain? i took an ap statistics class my junior year of high school, and as a project i actually compared index ring finger ratios to behavior. so if you have not heard about this, if you have a longer index finger it is a sign of being exposed to more estrogen in the womb, a longer ring finger is indicative of more testosterone and interestingly it correlates with spatial vs verbal reasoning. and actually verbal reasoning encompasses algebra interestingly. people with comparatively long index fingers scored higher on algebraic tests, people with longer ring fingers did better on spatial anyway i have a long index finger and do terribly spatially. so i am really not very male typical . i actually could have told you that i am not competitive or aggressive at all either. so anyway i do not think my problem is that i am not female enough, but for some reason i just keep getting these girls that fucking hate me and i do not ever know what i did to deserve it. i wonder if you can have a very female brain but sti will have aspergers? because i think i do. i am super awkward but i also present as someone who is...idk, i try to wear cute clothes and i have my sister help me pick them out. i do not think i look too out of place but for some reason i just keep getting targeted. again this did not happen til like my junior senior year of high school i am becoming an alcoholic because of this. i know i should focus on the people who like me but this vitriol is confusing to me i am thinking i am naive or stupid or i ammature or something and i can not perceive what is really happening or what i am doing wrong i have not had this issue with men at all but like i am and for almost a decade i have had all these women just detest me and i feel like i am doing something offensive without realizing it	moderate
have nothing to look forward to anymore. what now? i just needed to get this off my chest somewhere because i feel like if i told anyone i know personally they would laugh and call me pathetic or something. my depression used to be pretty unbearable, but one piece of advice that helped me a little was to focus on an event in the future and let that excitement keep you going. now i am starting to see the flaws with that advice. i am not too concerned about the virus that is been going around up until recently, but thanks to it everything i have been looking forward to is being canceled. the things that keep my going are just over, now what? i had an art show i was going to present my art at but it is cancelled after i spent so much money to get stuff made. big events in the coming months i was excited for are just canceled with no word about postponement or any future dates. it really feels like i am just floating in the water ai amlessly. i know this sounds incredibly pathetic but this was like my coping mechanism, and while it was not perfect it helped me at least stay on track a little. i am out of excitement, i am out of luck, i am out of money. i dunno what to do now. just rot away until this all blows over i guess, but it feels agonizing i am not going to lie. every day feels like a mi willennium as everything around me has grinder to a halt.	moderate

i can not do this... so lately, everyone is been so happy and celebrating the fact school is out. and me? i have been unusually aggressive and emotional these past few days. i am avoiding my family as much as i can. all i want to do is go out with few of my friends, but parents would not let me out cause of the virus. i am crying at least half of the day, every day. the reason? my ex. i can not get over the fact i can not see hi am. we have broken up three months ago, were friends for awhile, then i started ignoring hi am. he sti will snaps me someti ames, though. in school, chances that we ll bump into each other were small, but the idea of it sti will kept me going. i really do not know why i sti will love hi am, but i can not get over it. i have tried everything, literally. even found a new bf who is somewhat perfect, loves me and treats me perfectly, but i can not get over it. i told my ex i have never been happier, while in reality, i barely get out of bed, have sleep, drink water or eat. and it is getting worse with alcohol and drug abuse. i can not get over it... and the fact that he maybe, just maybe sti will loves me and the arguments behind it that my friend said to me just haunt me to the bone. my parents are not making it easier, either. they have never treated me worse. i can not talk to anyone about this because i feel like i have smothered them enough. but this is not me anymore. at one point, i had everything i have ever wanted, then he left me and bad luck kept following me from there, taking absolutely everything. what do i do? how do i wake myself up? i am not far from suicide. the only person who could change my mind is hi am, but i am not in the position to talk to hi am.	moderate
motivation amp art, with depression hm kinda unsure rn bc i have never posted to reddit before, but i have heard someti ames this place can help ? amp i have something i amportant, to me at least, basically i have always wondered how artists who speak about having depression or just are depressed in general somehow sti will make art amp release music create things etc., i can def understand that creating art can be a healthy release of negative emotions therefore making it logical to want to create when depressed instead of spiraling into other unhealthy destructive options, but for me at least, my depression causes me to be extremely unmotivated, on top of alcohol it is obviously a combination to not do anything productive, a lot of ti ames it is hard to find the motivation to do regular day to day things yknow ? yet i feel like i have seen a lot of depressed artists sti will somehow have the drive to create amp idk how that works, as someone who is made music my whole life i want to at least try to learn how ? bc ik when i make art is when i feel the best amp most fulfi willed, but it is just so hard to even find the motivation to get out of bed, or not have my inspiration ki willed by hour work days every weekday, so i just wonder if anyone knows any tips on how to be inspired to at least try to create art while depressed ? i can understand if this is maybe something w no direct answer tho, hope ya ll doin okay out there	moderate

i do not know where to start i have never been this bad i am starting to accept the possibility that i am depressed it feels like the last years are crashing onto me i have rape trauma, i ran myself into a gang banger who got me into drugs and addicted to meth all because i thought he made me feel safe and then dropped out of college, he stole thousands of dollars from me and cheated on me. i have been year sober since then. my insecurities and anxiety have skyrocketed. since then i have fallen in love to a good man and gotten married and i have a month old daughter now. but he is in the military and away until a good couple months from now, i very often feel i am not good enough i am in thisgust with myself physically from before for features and flaws i could never change and even more now after pregnancy and fear all the ti ame he wi will leave me for someone better or leave me because i am never happy. i have lost all interests in everything i used to love and have just outgrown them. i have no ti ame to even play games, and live an hour away from all my friends so no one comes to visit, i talk to no one every day and i can not leave the house with a baby so young. i am stuck with my own thoughts and judgements i can not do anything but overthink or just think about how awful i feel about myself or how sad i am all the ti ame. it is really hard for me to not talk to my husband about how awful i feel especially because he is my best friend. but i feel like he probably does not talk to me much because i am just so sad all the ti ame. i do not know what else to talk about other than how awful i feel and i am so afraid he wi will leave me for being like this. i am afraid of everything i have ever feared with being not good enough and i do not even love myself. every day is so much harder and i do not know how to make myself feel better in the slightest. if i hold in talking to my husband i feel awful and i just want hi am to know how i feel but when i tell hi am all these things i know he feels hopeless and it gets old very fast. i can not get therapy now because i currently live with my parents until i am reunited with my husband. my parents are not mental health friendly and if i tell them anything or even try to talk about any of these things they tell me i am being dramatic and should not fee this way or suck it up. if i get therapy which i have in the past for my trauma, i get very much ridiculed on a daily basis for it which just makes everything so much harder. i am going crazy not being able to talk to anyone everyday or feel good. all i do is watch tv or browse social media in between taking care of my daughter. and fake nice interactions with my parents. i have no hobbies anymore and if i did id hardly even have ti ame for it i really do not know what to do or where to start please i want help i can not wait until months from now for things to be a little better because i would be with my husband or to seek help i have a routine to keep up with hygiene i brush my teeth every day, skin care, shower and get dressed but all the empty space in between everything and my thoughts just make every single day so heavy and dreadful to get through what do i do please what do i do i need something	moderate
fucking life man! ugh! why does it have to be so hard?? i feel like i am always coming here to rant but i feel like i have no one to talk to most of the ti ame and it is hard. so tonight my boyfriend and i had plans since like four days ago to meet up at my place to thiscuss some things and spend some ti ame together. lately we had some serious problems and we are thinking about breaking up. also lately i have been really down, like not going out, not even getting out of bed and doing nothing all day down. i am also really stressed out about the coronavirus. so his friends made some plans to meet up today at a friend is place and he said we should go together etc and i said well you know that is i ampossible, i can not hang out and especially with your friends because i do not feel comfortable around them i do not know them well and i can not tell them about my situation. but i said you should go if you feel like you need to spend ti ame with your friends and you want to hang out. and well i said that because it was the right thing to do but he actually went and i feel so fucking alone. i ruin everything, i can not even go and hang out at a friend is house and have fun. hell, i can not even get out of the house. i have not seen anyone for a week now and before that day it was like another two weeks. i just want some company. and he is the only one right now who knows what i am going through so none of my friends are like you know what if you do not want to go out i wi will come to your place because they do not know i want to go out but i can not so they just thing i want to stay in and do nothing about it. of course it is my mistake because i do not tell them what is going on and how i feel but fuuuckk i feel so alone. my eyes are so red i am sick of crying ugh why is it so difficult to talk? i just wish at least one person would understand that i need some pushing right now, someone to be here without me asking them to.. it is so hard and it sucks because i have no one to blame but myself uugh	moderate

young, military aviator hello, so some quick perspective. i am a young military officer going through undergraduate pilot training. i am nearly through graduate in july i believe , but i have never been so unhappy in my life. i feel like none of the choices i have made were my own, like all were ends to means. examples i wouldn t have gone to college if i did not have the military scholarship. i could not choose my major, activities because of this. i did not necessarily have to apply for pilot, but it was heavily expected of my family father. all in all it feels as though i am scraping bleeding clawing for a future that i have not actualized for myself yet. on top of this commitment and thisplacement inherent in the job, my fianc left me. i offer the nuclear family idea , i love you but i can not follow you around is on full repeat. my friends and loved ones do not understand what i do and leave when it is convenient. i do not want to hurt myself, i do not want a thishonorable thischarge, i want to be happy, i want to serve. however everything about my position is take, take, take. i have less and less to give and i am exhausted. it has me thinking dark thoughts and questioning my value and role in this. i feel like i have lost everyone and myself in the process. i have taken ample steps for mental health. i was wondering if anyone on this page has had si amilar experiences due to job commitment and has useful coping mechanisms. i am going to need them, i have a year commitment.	moderate

i think i have depression but i am scared that i am just giving self pity. all i feel nowadays is pain, extreme sadness or nothingness. i am not sure if what i am having are mental breakdowns i might be overreacting. someti ames i cry myself to sleep thinking about all the negatives in my life. to counter that i tried coming up with a list of the things that give me pleasure in my life i am not going to specify what is on there but it is very small. furthermore, my parents are strict in my home, shouting all the ti ame and telling me i need to work and i amprove my grades. whenever i am not working, i am literally finding any form of luxury to do before i am asked to do something again. i can never fully relax at home. whenever i am being shouted at, i can not talk back to my parents otherwise i am treated as the brattiest kid they have witnessed. this has caused me to become extremely introverted, shy and has given me a you re better of just shutting up mindset which brings me on to school. i have made multiple friends in my school, unintentionally. i am very quiet and do not really feel comfortable around them? i get a really bad feeling mentally around them as if they are all out to get me. i feel as if i am just an inconvenience when i am around many i go silent, sweat quite a bit and wi will eventually just drift away from the group. i assume that is just what the life of a general introvert is like. i can not speak to anyone since i do not trust anyone, i feel like i do not exist around the majority people in my life. i feel like my life is just hard work, no joy, pain and suffering. i feel like my friends are fake. i feel like my parents do not honestly think about how i feel or even care. i feel demotivated. i feel constantly tired. just thought i would vent here. i repeat, i may be exaggerating the problems of my life but i need others views on this. do i have depression? i can not really speak to anyone about this since i am seen as one of the happiest people in others eyes, my parents are strong christians and so i do not believe they wi will understand how i can possibly feel this way, as if they raised me wrong. sorry if this all seems quite sloppily written, i am just venting. what are your takes?	moderate
i want to tell my parents long story short, i can not i am fucking done f, i am not even diagnosed or anything, and maybe i am just telling myself that i am depressed. maybe its fake. whatever it is, i want it to be gone. i want to want good grades. i want to want to try. i want to not look forward to the day i die. knowing that i can not go through committing i want to want to stop cutting. i want to stop being bitter and angry. i want to stop saying i am fine. but i can not. i can not get help. my parents dont think about mental health. they wi will blame it on my sleep schedule, or my phone. theyll just take my stuff and say that when i actually go out and experience stuff i wi will be okay. my phones the only thing that makes me feel like i am not alone. i have friends, i just dont like to bother them. i am so fucking done.	moderate

i truly do hate myself. i have been having a lot of flashbacks about stuff that i have done that was trashy and thisgusting. i have also been having dreams of stuff i wish i had such as friends and girlfriends. i also felt like i was not physically strong and the fact that i am ugly. i hate my school life as it is boring and not cool. i have been wanting to program and draw and stuff but i can not. i feel lazy and idk why,i wish i was like normal people because i am dumb. my acquaintance told me that she had a th grade level of reading in st grade i think,i dunno details are fuzzy. that just made me feel extremely unmotivated and ashamed of myself. i could not form sentences at a young age and yet this girl can read at a higher age. i am wanting to become something in my life,make my own theme park,make and develop video games,draw and color things at an professional mode,do all of the cool vfx sfx stuff,ani amate and make ani amated movies and just normal movies and also make my own figures and franchises. i wish i had the ski will and talent to do these things but unfortunately i can not. i truly wish i could go to parathise but myself says no,i hate it because i want to end it.	moderate

so much is wrong i am just typing this all out here cause i do not want to bother my friends and just want to let this out. i am not going to bore you ll with the details but the past years have been tough for me and when i got into uni i really believed that things would change or did i falsely believe in that notion idk but week is ago i had a mental breakdown at a party and it is something i have been dealing with for the past years and like all through out the next couple of days i was just like fuck this was not supposed to happen. i did not want to show this fucked side of me, wanted to hide it so nobody knew but that failed and like the people who saw me crying asked me days after i was after and i just felt so shit. idek what to do and this is only one thing. two i hate seeing people in love. all the relationships i have had have been fucked with my first gf cheating on me, my second gf breaking up with me cause her ex was upset and my third gf breaking up with me cause of my mental health which was really bad and tbh i do not hate for doing what she did. after everything that is happened and how each of those relationships have fucked my mind up i just do not like seeing people in love cause all my mind tells me is love is not for you, it wi will just go soon as it comes into your life. you would not find someone. ik it is not the case but when i see my friends with their significan not others it just fucks me up and i just feel low at that point and i hate it. thirdly i feel lonely as fuck especially in uni. i am not in uni now as i came back to my home country cause of the virus but while i was in uni i felt fucking lonely and that might have been a factor why i broke down but fuck it is just lonely. i have no support system like i have back home. i have friends but it is more like i am an outsider cause they have their own social media groups and stuff and idk it just genuinely feels like i have no one at all and it sucks so fucking much but its how it is and i just hope that as the months go on things wi will change but i just do not know. last thing idek why but i think i have feelings for my best friend. bit of context i liked her and i started speaking to her and we became really friendly and when i told her that i liked her she told me she did not feel the same way and i dealt with it cause i had made an amazing fucking friend and i was not going to let something like this ruin what had come into my life. well couple of months have passed and i think i like her again and idk why. like she is my best friend and i love her with all my heart. she is helped me through my mental struggles, she gets me, understands me and what is more she is the best person ik but ik she would not like me back and i thought i got over this and like it is fucking with my head. cause tbh if i could date her ik she would be the one i would want to end up with hands down but like idk this is all fucked. i might just be feeling like this cause i am lonely or i might actually like her. fuck idk i do not even know why this is happening. that is it. i am sorry this is long and i apologize. if no one reads this cause it is long i understand. if there are people thank you for taking the ti ame and effort to read this	moderate

dealing with sadness i have been struggling with sadness since forever. i never had a friend irl. i have only had small social interactions such as talking to a few people at school or going with someone to the cinema. those interactions end quickly as i realise that the only person who cares is me. nobody really ever cared about whether they are talking to me or not. even at home, my sister never talks to me. i am trying to show that i am not so happy, but nobody cares. my parents ask me to ask my sister how is she doing if they see she is sad, but it is never been the other way around. all the people i know online are also slowly drifting away since i keep becoming more sad and i talk to them rarely. i had a girlfriend once. it was a random desperate to have a boyfriend type of girl that some people brought to the cinema. our relationship was empty and lasted roughly months. i did not take her seriously, she was i ammature, did not understand that i am not extroverted. i did not care that much when she broke up with me. i tried finding friends online. even though they were nice to me, offered me to move to them when i finish school so i can have friends, but as i mentioned they never really talk to me first and they began to drift away, because one of them has a girlfriend now. i tried finding a better girlfriend by using tinder yeah, i know that it was a mistake , but noticed that girls do not talk to guys first. i realised that dating apps are something not for me since i can not begin a conversation. i also realised that i am not sure whether having a girlfriend would be good for me since i envy them more than i am into them. that is another thing that makes me sad. it is something commonly described as gender dysphoria . i feel like i do not relate to men and my goals differ. i have decided that i am not going to change my gender or anything. it would be a nightmare process. my family would hate me, i wouldn t have any money for that, i wouldn t be even able to go to a therapist since i am so anxious about going there. i sort of accepted that this thing is going to make me sad until the end of my life. i also have plans about my future. i am , i am graduating high school in one year i am european so the system is different here and yet i have hobbies, things i am good at, social ski wills or whatever i am really anxious about that. the only thing that someti ames makes me happy is alcohol. it may sound like a bad addiction or something, i actually have no issues with it. it just makes me happier and it does not bring any negative consequences. there is more to my story, but i am going to end it here. i just felt like venting today, because i have never done that before. also sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is my nd language and i am too lazy to check if everything is correct.	moderate
nothing brings joy life is joyless. even things i used to enjoy at my most basic. i do not even watch tv shows or movies anymore.... the thought of even sitting through something new or familiar is just plain blah... no matter how much i try to rationalize logically how it might, or even wi will, be interesting or bring some kind of emotion change in the right direction i just do not find the drive to. i have been reduced to sleeping and watching a string of incoherent youtube videos just to have random sensory sti amulation going on... as sort of a way to sleep while awake ... it is dull, makes ti ame fly, and thistracts from the reality of, well, reality. i used to get joy from video games... now i can not get past the menu screen before being completely turn off from playing. a sort of thisgust... like what is the point? nothing brings joy when you re alone and forgotten.	moderate

i want to give up on myself and my depression recovery due to the spread of the coronavirus... although i have not once panicked about the rising cases of the coronavirus that is being spread across the globe it has me worried but in a different way then most people might be worried. i am worried that by having the coronavirus being spread out like it is my years of depression recovery has now been rendered useless. it was all for nothing. while i am sti will suffering severe depression i have been taking my meds daily for months now and have been working out at the ymca to motivate myself for better mental health wanting to finally choose life. i also have social anxiety which means i need to be outside a lot more just for exposure therapy which also has been working so i can be less fearful of the public. but now the coronavirus is in my state of minnesota and while i am not worried about getting affected i am worried that seeking recovery from depression would in the end just become pointless if i do get it. hell i do not even need the virus to believe that i need to end my journey towards recovery as the affects are already happening. schools and stores are already closing so should i just accept the fact that i wi will not overcome my depression as only worst things wi will continue to happen to me to prevent any mental health progress from happening?	moderate

the ti ame my aunt encouraged me to commit suicide i am a first ti amer so apologies for any mistakes i make a mistake in this post. for years now i have suffered from what i believe to be clinical depression. as a kid i never really felt happy and after my dad died it only got worse. this is largely in part a result of the way my aunt uncle cousins treated me. one of the examples that never ceases to haunt me is an incident that occurred when i was eleven. at this point i had not seen my dad in quite a while as he lived in mississippi while i live in texas it is a long story that i wi will not get into today . at the ti ame i was feeling depressed at the ti ame as i honestly felt that no one cared about me or what i had to say. i was raised with the idea that doing something for attention was something to be frowned upon. despite this however i was desperate to know that someone was listening, that someone cared. it was at this point that i started talking about suicide as i felt if anyone was listening they would want to know and understand why. i was wrong . after thiscovering how i was talking my aunt proceeded to take me to her house, where she screamed and yelled at me for quite some ti ame about how she was going to put the fear of god into me . it was after this that she decided to get a kitchen knife from the knife block, clai aming that it would be the easiest way to do it. she then attempted to give me the knife while saying that i was just doing it for attention and that if i actually going to do it to do it, as she would sit back and watch. i wi will never understand why she felt it necessary to do this to an eleven year old boy. if you have gotten this far i would like to thank you for reading my post, i can post about some of the other ti ames if you d like.	moderate

it is suffocating i have been living with my panic attack since i was a child. i can not think straight when things get too overwhelm. i oftenly run from the problem and as a child, i wi will hide behind my parent. now i am y o and i becoming a president in an active club. for the past months, i have done so many mistakes that made the ppl in the club and advisor mad at me. it so stressing me out. i have told them that i can not lead because i have my own issues, but they keep pushing me to accept it. every day is a torture to me. i try to make things better but it there wi will always be problems and mistakes. i cry so many ti ames during this tenure, and i can not hold it back anymore. what should i do?	moderate
i do not know what to feel a few minutes ago, i was on the verge of a break down and played some sad songs to just try and let it all out. all of a sudden, i can not feel anything. i can not cry...all i feel is confusion and anger and i do not know what to do with this feeling . the music is not speaking to me...it legit feels like nothing can please me at the moment but i want to feel better but i can not. i do not know how to explain this. i think i am tired. my body is done and just angry at life now? ugh. idk why can not this world end already! i am tired of these ups and downs.	moderate
i dont know anymore i can not tell if i am depressed or just sad. i have everything i need, a family, supportive people, a roof, a bed... but recently i have no wi will to get out of bed and i have been taking way to many naps. and i have no motivation to go outside, do my favorite hobbies, hang out with friends, or even talk to them. i am stuck in my room and when i try to go out i end up going back inside and staying in my room all day. i never told anyone because people are going to think i am just whoring for attention. so i keep it to myself. i really dont know what i am doing with my life, at points i had suicidal thoughts but what makes no sense is that i havent been through the struggle that other people have been through. i dont know what it is at this point and i am not and wi will never open up to somebody... this is really unhealthy, taking naps everyday, for more than hours constantly. i want to have a good future but at this point i can not even see myself doing anything with my life after highschool. anyone else experience stuff like this?	moderate
the only place i could think to put this i am not old at all, so it makes sense as tow hy i dont know any of this but i just wanted to see if anyone knew anything about what i am like. i have also never really done anything like this,, venting in general not just online. basically i am sorry if this is all over the place and the quesrions are dumb i dont really feel happy or sad, just sort of empty. i can pretend to be happy throughout the day but as soon as i get home, nothing. absolutely nothing. i also dont outright love anything or hate anything, most of its just neutral. i just do those things to pass ti ame and get through the day and onto the next. i have not really spoken to anyone about this mainly because it does not seem like depression and honestly others have it worse, so i just tend to live with i suppose. i have tried to reaching out to friends but i i ammediately get thismissive because i feel needy and stupid. i am a mess. i think about suicide, i have written notes and i think about how i might do it. all of my opinions on things are just neutral. it is like i dont love or like anything. this can spread from music, to shows, to even my family and friends. theres nothing i love, everything is sort of just there in my life, and i assume things wi will just be filtered out until the next batch of things in my life come in and i just find them neutral as well. i am not a fan of any sort of sexual stuff. the only reason i want to have sex is so i dont feel like i am falling behind or different from others. everyti ame i have gone out with someone the furthest i wi will go is just kissing them on the check because i guess i just dont like kissing. i just feel so alone and awkward when texting or talking to my friends about my problems, so they just tend to fester. i do not talk to anyone, i dont go out, i just stay in my room anyti ame i am free. however, i did try going on friday but i was so socially exhausted even after doing nothing i just left without saying goodbye. they walked off one way and i just slid off to another path and went home. is that weird? like i said i am sorry of the random assortment of paragraphs of my problems and short anecdotes. i just had to say something even if it was on reddit.	moderate
suicide v k i have been targeted with electronic harassment technologies for going on two years. they refer to it as v k . it is a chat bot that basically tortures your mind until you commit suicide. well low and behold, here i am considering taking my life due to the sheer pressure of this torture. i am at the absolute end with all of this and wanted to reach out to see if there is possibly a solution for this.	moderate
i tried. i do not even know why i am posting this. i guess i just needed it to be out there somewhere. i tried so hard. i tried to be normal and productive and healthy, but i can not even complete basic tasks without a meltdown these days. all i do is upset everyone around me, cry and sleep. i tried. i am so tired but i did try. even if it seemed like i was not trying. i was. i think i am going to end it tonight. i think that is best.	moderate
i thought i had this under control i thought i had a plan to make it through the rest of the semester. i felt ok about the future. then i heard my school was situation would change due to the virus. that was stressful, but i thought i could manage it because it was just temporary and i could sti will stay on campus part ti ame because i had labs, and deal with the lack of structure by asking other students to attend classes online with me in the lounge, and maybe pick up extra shifts at work and see my boyfriend more the rest of the week when i was at home. but now i am being kicked out the rest of the semester and my life seems to have fallen apart. i just feel so lost and angry. i do not even remember the last ti ame i felt so awful. i know i am going to fall apart without the structure. my boyfriend says he can not see me because his dad has cancer. my work is inevitably going to shut down. i am going to fail all my online classes if i am not expelled for emailing fuck you to the chancellor twice . i have no other close friends. my dad and sister have just screamed at me. i could stay at my moms house with my other sister, but my mother is mentally unstable herself. they are already fed up with me for basically having to drag me from my dorm room yesterday and i sti will have to go back to pack more . i have felt like crying for the past hours. i know this is just temporary but i am not strong enough. i am selfish, i know this is for public health or whatever, but i just do not really care. honestly at least getting the virus would be more interesting than the catatonic depression i am inevitably going to regress to. i do not even have any desire to live right now. it is not like i am equipped to handle this world. i was foolish to think otherwise.	moderate
anxiety directly i ampacts my depression i know this is not unusual but my suicidal thoughts seem to spawn directly after i get anxious over something. this whole coronavirus thing has temporarily paused me going to class in real life, i was supposed to do a lot in terms of figuring out what i would do for the summer and fall semesters and needed to talk to professors about what to do and now i can not really talk to them face to face. that has a domino effect on me and now i am like well i am just going to drop out and not do my work and i should just end it. like whenever something is slightly inconvenient that is what my mind goes too. i guess in general life just makes me extremely anxious. like lately i have been thinking what the hell am i going to do. who am i going to be. who am i going to end up with? what if i end up alone? i do not even want kids anymore so now what... there is just so much that my brain has a hard ti ame dealing with i guess.	moderate
idk i hate when ppl say that i can talk to them, and they never answer. i hate having ocd, anxiety, adhd, migraines, ibs, and now depression. i never asked for this shit. it is my senior year and i am suffering everyday and i have not had a full day of happiness in months. i just do not know what to do. nothing gets better. i want to be with the girl i like but i have lost every ounce of confidence i have. no one gets me. my friends who do care about me think that i am fine, and i do not want to tell people i am not. idk what to do. i feel so alone i cry a lot more than i ever have these days. i want to feel the happiness i felt so much throughout my life until these last months again. it is just sad that all my friends think i am fine and getting better when i am getting worse. it is annoying when people tell me it wi will get better soon and act so positive. i just donf know what to do. so far have not tried anything suicidal and i do not want too, i am not like that but life is just getting shittier and shittier and i am just reaching my breaking point. i wish someone could understand yk?	moderate
older virgin here, contemplating suicide hey guys. i am a is m older virgin here from a sikh background. i have led a life helping the community and started my own non for profit. i have a successful education and business life. i do not commit cri ames either. depression has caused me to become an alcoholic cumulating in me having a bad day a month ago regarding a high level drink driving crash with a ton of bad traffic offences that followed. my family has always been scummy to me dad and brother beat my mum autistic aunty when i am not home and abuse them and i have lived a solitary life as i am very ugly. i am facing heavy jail ti ame and fines that i am unable to pay for including pay for my mums home in which case we wi will be homeless soon. i have no sympathy for my mum anymore she would not divorce or thistance herself from my brother and dad. i have never felt happy in my entire adult life and never touched a girl that way. i tried ki willing myself unsusesfully. before court sentencing i am thinking of jumping into the high ocean as i can not swi am and drown. my question is this and it is a serious one. wi will god forgive me for dying a virgin?	moderate
i hate my life currently and do not know what to do with it. i am currently training as a teacher in the uk. my workload is massive and it is getting to the point where i do not think il be able to do the work they are asking me to do to an acceptable standard. i live with my girlfriend an amazing person and currently earn enough to pay all my own bi wills and such, but the workload problem is becoming quite heavy. the issue lies in that this profession is just too abusively difficult to get into to be a viable career to me any more. the training has been so hurtful to my mental health that my friends are starting to worry, i have retreated into my room most hours of the day and i am extremely reluctant to do anything at all, which is starting to affect my relationship. i now absolutely hate this profession in the deepest part of my heart, and no longer wish to go into it. but that is the catch . because if i leave the position i am in right now i would not be able to afford to live and wi will have to move back in with my parents, a move which i fear wi will end my relationship due to my failure. this is not a bad reflection of my so, as she is an amazing person, but she just holds me to high standards, which i hit the majority of the ti ame. please do not comment on this as it wi will be unhelpful. i have absolutely made up my mind, i must leave the teaching profession before it ki wills me, i have never ever been this unhappy about the direction of my life. i have a physics degree, so i have a lot of paths i can take, but the one i have taken an interest recently in is law. i am thinking if i want to study law, i can fairly comfortably study it once i am out of teacher training, and into just working as a teacher, but right now my biggest fear is that i wi will fail my course due to the crushing workload, and in that scenario i do not see myself surviving long. the weight of the thoughts of i am going to fail are extremely strong right now, and i am struggling to leave my bed due to the stress i know it wi will bring. i have described in to a friend as a daily psychological execution . the fear is keeping me up at night, and during the day i can not escape the feeling of foreboding. i have a teaching job interview tomorrow. i am going to bed now, as i wi will need to get up in a few hours. i wi will read any replies then. if you made it this far, thanks for reading.	moderate
this probably sounds like i am talking in a circle but this is my cry for help. i dont know what else to do growing up was rough. all of elementary and middle school i was bullied i was left out or i had no one to talk to. my mother had talked to the school counselor to get me diagnosed with a form of high functioning autism. i was thrown on random meds to the point that i was not able to control myself. i looked like a zombie, i acted like a zombie. growing up i was never allowed to show my true self, i was always scared to be me. my mother and father fought all the ti ame until they split up when i was . my mom moved to raleigh and took my sister and i with her, she could only afford a duplex in the bad part of town, for all of th grade i was the only white boy in my school, i had a target on my back i was always getting into fights or altercations it got bad enough that people would come to my house to try and fight me. there were multiple ti ames where i was getting shot at in the neighborhood i lived in. the police would drive by all the ti ame doing patrols or scouting the area before they did a drug bust. i remember one day after school i had gotten off the bus to walk to my house and all i could see were red and blue lights in front of my house as multiple cops had just busted into my home. i had lost it when i saw swat dragging my mom out in cuffs. after my dad heard about that he had my sister and i moved back in with hi am. when we got off the plane to live with hi am we met his new girlfriend, instantly i knew she was not good. my dad worked hours away from where he lived so there would be ti ames we would be left alone with her for weeks on end, she had all of these strict rules with harsh punishments almost always she would escalate it to the point of myself or my sister getting swatted with a wooden spoon, hanger, belt, and even a x . there were ti ames where she said she wanted to break a piece of oak over my back side, i remember how i spent more ti ame crying myself to sleep then actually being happy, i was not allowed to talk to anyone about what was going on and it had gotten so bad on so many occasions that i was actually scared for my life. i did not know how i was going to be able to go to school the next day, hell i would rather go to school then be home and school was not much better for me, i was always alone, i had no friends and i had no one to talk to. i would always have to run out of class crying because something small had happened that would upset me. growing up i could remember multiple ti ames where i wanted to die, where i thought that was the only way out of the misery i was going though. i had attempted to take my own life on multiple occasions. i had tried ti ames before i was , once i tried to overdose, again i had used a string as a noose. when i was i tried again but this ti ame i had a gun to my head. i had almost fully depressed the trigger but something stopped me. i can not explain the feeling but my body almost felt as though i was overtaken by an outside force. there is ti ames i sit there and wish that i had pulled the trigger, ti ames i wish i was not alive anymore, when i was in the school house i had gotten so overwhelmed that i had to leave my room. it was a wednesday evening around or pm, the duty nco was doing his rounds checking the building. he saw me sitting on the stairs and instantly knew something was wrong, he said the last ti ame he saw someone with the expression i had on my face they had ki willed themselves. growing up i was always down and sad. it takes me a minute to think of something that made me smile, it is not hard for me to think of something negative that happened when i was growing up since that is of what happened when i grew up. hell there is multiple ti ames where my step mother had called the cops on me because she did not want to deal with me. no matter what happened i would get punished, my sister ran away from home and i was the one who suffered the consequences because i did not stop her. i would always cry myself to sleep if i could fall asleep. now every ti ame someone raises a hand at me i flinch, not because i am scared but out of reflex. id always feel more comfortable away from everyone being alone because i was scared i would do something to get in trouble. i never went out growing up and i didnt have any friends i was close to. i sti will have problems talking to people. i have problems telling people how i feel or expressing my emotions. i remember after my stepmother had called the cops on me and when i was back home from the hospital she had me sit down at the dining room table every day from sun up to sun down writing sentences over and over again. every day after school i would have to sit there and do homework. after i finish my homework i would have to start writing. i ended up writing all sentences ti ames each. the only way i was allowed to move was to ask if i could use the bathroom. on the weekends she would make me get up at to sit down there and start writing. and i would sit there up to pm. and every ti ame i tried to talk to someone about it she would either deny it all together or she would say that i was overreacting. i was all the ti ame getting screamed at, cussed at and belittled saying i would never be good enough, id never do anything with my life or id never do anything to matter. that i would end up being some low life piece of trash. i spent more ti ame in my room away from everyone then trying to socialize because i was scared of human interaction. i did not tell my dad about my first girlfriend until after we broke up because i was scared that he would thisown me. i never had someone i could go to to talk about things with. i was not allowed to go out, i was not allowed to socialize, i was not allowed to express myself. i am almost years old and i sti will do not have a good social life. i moved out at years old. i am living on my own and i sti will stay home. i stay away from everyone, i am scared to go out, i get anxiety when i go out into large crowds, i try to run away when i get crowded.	moderate
i am a stain on the face of the earth, i am a horrible person with no good qualities, nobody would miss me, i am contemplating suicide and i am pretty calm about it, it is something i am destined to do indubitably, i am not worth anything as a being, contrary to the belief of all redditors who wi will reply to this, i have never once done anything correct in my life, all i have ever succeeded in has been to be hurtful and thisrespectful to others and taking others for granted. all i breed is catastrophe. i am not at all talented or ski willed at anything in particular, i am below average in every concept known to man. i have no motivation nor intention to progress in my life. i seem to be an inconvenience, an unpleasant burden towards society. i would say my existence is more so comparable to a tumor, i am not productive and only produce negative effects on others that unfortunately have the unbearable pain that comes from interaction with someone like me. entrapped in this body, i dream of going into eternal sleep, a great rest that lasts to the end of ti ame. i do not have any interest in anything anymore, daily politics bore me a great deal and i am not at all intrigued by life at all. i do not see a reason to not follow through with it when i have no intrinsic value and no drive nor intent to live at all.	moderate
feelings of depression and guilt exacerbated by pandemic feeling guilty about feelings during pandemic...? i am in ontario, canada, so currently we are not under any lockdown or anything that extensive. however, it seems like we are heading in that direction. i have really poorly managed anxiety, we have been playing with my meds for months now. almost a year ago i had a pretty serious suicide attempt, and it is been a waiting game since then to try and get me back on track due to the lack of access to the appropriate medical services. anyways, i feel guilty for becoming suicidal during the pandemic. there is so much else happening everywhere there is no cases in my town , that i feel bad for even considering ki willing myself but that guilt is what is driving me to the edge. i feel like it is only a matter of ti ame before i snap. i live alone and i am terrified that if they quarantine us i would not be able to see my caseworker or my therapist. i have been seeing someone twice a week most weeks because i can not make it more than a few days without going into extreme thistress. it does not help that i am coming out of a manic episode. i am terrified of being locked in my apartment alone, and i am scared that i do not know what is happening. i do not even care about the virus. if i get it, i am a high risk, so it might be bad. but we do not have any cases here. i am more worried about the actions of other people. i have severe gastroparesis and i am just so done with living a this point because i am in such a horrible flare. i can not eat anything. the things i can eat everyone is emptying the shelves of panic buying soup and rice...etc . i do not know what to do. ifeel like i can not go to the hospital to reach out for help and support when i am in crisis, but i also can not keep doing this. my classes got cancelled and i am thinking that i wi will be out a job next week most likely based on how things are going right now as well...please help i do not know what to do, i know deep down i want to live and that is why i am reaching out but right now i am losing all of my reasons. i have been staying in bed all day everyday and that is usually one of the final signs for me.	moderate

i posted here months ago on a throwaway account i sti will feel the same. if you thought this was some i am totally fine now and have my life on track story, then you re wrong. i feel the same, maybe worse. things that have happened since then i have gotten closer with my friends i start worrying or thinking about other people when i want to ki will myself. i want a dog. things that have not changed since then i sti will have the thoughts, nobody can tell, i am stressed and i am always planning my suicide at the back of my mind. i am happy. or i am supposed to be. i have many friends, whom i love. they make me laugh. i went out with them on the weekend, first ti ame in a while when i have ever gone outside. it was really fun. we ate and watched a movie sonic came out yesterday, well two days ago since it is am . and then i came home and realised that i was scared to feel really down again and did everything i could to prolong my happiness. i focused on this topic, talked about how great the movie was and what we did etc. and then i slept and woke up miserable. it was good while it lasted. i think i might have fooled myself into this. i keep thinking about it and i could have tricked myself into believing i was depressed or something. i do not really know. i have thought about suicide. but i do not know if i could do it. one thing that made me doubt it was when a meme was shared on our group chat. it was something like types of friends and the depressed one came up. we were all making jokes about it, me included, and deciding who was who. one of my friends said that i definitely could not be the depressed one, along with her and another. that had me thinking, first damn, i am a good actor. then none of them really know. if i ki willed myself, it would be a massive surprise. i do not know if i could do that to them. since then, i have tried to leave a couple of hints but they weren t really good hints and weren t picked up. that sucked. i want them to know it was not their fault but i do not want to leave a suicide note. i would be expected to explain my actions and if i survive, it would make my life a living hell. i also have one friend, who could be extra vulnerable or saddened by my sudden death. she has admitted to every one that she has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts but is not diagnosed because her family do not have enough money for a psychiatrist. i am kinda jealous that she was able to confess everything to this group of people she was not super close with. i can not even confess to my sister and i have know her my whole life. the confession seemed sincere and i had noticed she was a bit thistant some days. so it is believable. and i do not want her to do the same thing. i also do not know how. an overdose on pi wills probably would not ki will me and i do not go outside much so i do not have many ideas for a bridge to jump off. i always have the urge to ki will myself whenever something slightly wrong happens. like saying something weird or embarrassing at the ti ame or doing something stupid. that is why i tend to make a lot of jokes and surreal crap, i do not focus on it because it makes literally no sense and other people found it funny too. i am tired of this and it is am now. boris, shut down the schools already. think of my mental health, bloody hell. i am off to do homework i should have done hours ago. yeet.	moderate
happiness is delusional in my entire life...not once have i feel happiness, hope, joy, not even fucking content. i am so consumed with bitterness and anger that i feel this is all i wi will ever know. at this point i view any form of hope or positivity as si amply outrageous and stupid. i can not understand it. how people can just feel happy for no good reason. my entire life has been lived in agony, pain, misery, torment. and i have never been able to escape. at this point, happiness seems delusional.	moderate
life is getting ahead of me aside from the fact that my current semester grades and social life is shit i am actually doing alright. i am right now and have worked jobs, going for a third during the summer. i have taken college courses and passed them, trying to look good for the calstates i am trying to apply to. the problem is that literally all of this progress i was held by the hand by my parents. they almost made me do all of these things as i hesitated doing so. by myself, i am not productive at all and i am just trying to up my rating on a few games because those are one of the few things that help me find joy in life, even if it does not work all the ti ame. i someti ames go through intense depressive states where i just succumb and literally stare at nothing for half of the day. it is pointless trying to make progress when life feels so shit, i really just want to do the bare mini amum.	moderate

could it get much worse? i know the title seems dramatic, but it keeps going through my head. every ti ame thing good happens, things happen that make everything worse. example my scholarship went through for university and i got dollars , in the bank. i went to lease a horse that i would been visited for a few months. except my car broke, and shortly afterwards, the agistment prices went beyond what i can afford, and the owner is going to sell hi am to make ends meet. everything keeps getting worse and worse. when does it stop? what is the li amit? so now i am stuck in a city alone. i have no car. no job. no friends or family. no horse. i have dollars a week extra to spend on food. no motivation. no one at all to talk to. and it is getting to be too much. my only productivity is running. whats worse, i am paranoid all the ti ame. worried something is going to happen. worried there is someone in my house, watching me, stalking. i can not take it.	moderate
i threw my life away and i am on the verge of suicide i am sorry if this is super long, i just need to finally get this out so i am years old and for the last months, every single one of my days have been repeating this cycle wake up around pm pm, eat the exact same thing as the day before due to eating problems , hide away from everyone, including family, sleep at around am am. occasionally adding self harm the list. i guess i wi will start from when this started. back in april i was the happiest person, i was dating a girl that i can not explain my love for, she meant everything to me. let us pretend her name was emily. we saw each other very often and it was going well, until i realised that she was not happy some nights. it was about or weeks into the relationship and i wasnt making her happy, i was saying all the wrong things and making her cry. i was hurting her unintentionally. i loved emily so much that i couldnt stand hurting her, so i started to hurt myself. this is when i stared to cut my arms. she noticed my arms and of course seeing that made her even more upset. this kept happening until i could not handle hurting her anymore. we broke up about and a half months into the relationship but instead of a normal breakup, emily attempted to ki will herself because of the thought of living without me. i did not hear from her a day or two after that night. but that night i had a lot of blood dripping out of me and i cried myself to sleep most nights after. emily was ok and nothing serious happend to her thankfully. around this ti ame i was in college and had exams to take, due to the stress of everything, i failed them all except my main course s. throughout the summer and autumn i was sti will cutting myself but not too often, it was about ti ames a month i would say. it stays like this to this day. fast forward to christmas , i had not recovered from the pain of making someone attempt suicide. i hid away as much as i could. speaking only when spoke to. fast forward again to mid to late january and i suddenly got crushed by my mind. only going outside of my room when necessary food, water and toilet . i became silent even when spoken to and found it hard to talk. i could not handle being around others and it only got worse. it got to the point where i dropped out of college unexpectedly at the end of january. ever since then i have woken up with no meaning, motivation or point to my life. i have only one reason to live the hope that one day i wi will finally see my best friend, katie face to face. she lives halfway across the world and every day the chance of that dream coming true gets lower and lower. i do not want to be alive anymore, i have no reason to be. i am a burden and a waste of space and money and ti ame. i have abandoned all friends i once had with the exception of katie . i enjoy plotting my suicide in my head with the hopes that i wi will find the courage to act it out one day. i want to die. and soon.	moderate
its been five years since the last year that i was somewhat happy five freaking years, i can not even believe, i expected so much from the future then i started realizing that none of my dreams would actually come true, everything went downhi will after , and it just gets worse was worse than and is already worse than all those years combined i wish i could just die	moderate
my mental health has utterly derailed my life i had to leave my good job because i could not get out of bed half the ti ame and when i was there i could not perform to the high standard required. i have not worked in nearly a year. i have gone into debt as a result of it, borrowed money from family i can not pay back and can not pay off my debts either. i used to fluctuate between the top end of a healthy bmi to slightly overweight but i have gained nearly and am obese. i have not put ti ame or energy into my passion that i eventually want to make a career because i have no energy despite having nothing but ti ame. its overwhelming how quickly it all fell apart for me and managing my anxiety about it all is so difficult when my concerns are all perfectly fucking valid. i do not even know why i am posting about it but i suppose i needed to vent. i just wish i could afford therapy, most of my financial issues are secret and i wish to keep them that way and i do not like talking to people involved in my life about my deep issues. that unbiased third party would be a godsend but it is what it is. someti ames i just feel like i wi will never dig myself out of the mess i have created by falling to pieces.	moderate
the place between hopelessness and being too scared of suicide is a mental i willness in and of itself i just want a good way to go out. jesus i can not lie, but it is so fucking scary and i hate it.	moderate
i go to sleep every night wishing my pain would go away, and waking up every morning regretting i didnt just end it i wi will probably just delete this later, but i need to get this off my chest. i am in my mid twenties and i have had depression since i was . i didnt know what it was until i was due to family either writing it off or just thisgusted with me saying i was just trying to be angsty. i was not. i was in so much pain, and i did not know why. i figured out it was my family at and moved out. the whole dramatic i wi will never see you again bullshit. we re very close now, but it look may years and hardships to bring us there. i got help, went to a therapist, got medication. it all seemed to help for a bit. i tried different medication when the last one stopped working. i gave up on therapists because i just felt like i was whining the entire session. sti will can not talk to a therapist for that reason, it never helps me. but i digress. nothing helps anymore. i am in so much pain, everyday. i have mentioned this to friends, and have even told one about wanting to end my life. and he was very blunt and told me all the people that would miss me. which i needed to snap me back to reality. and at the ti ame i believed hi am enough to not consider it any longer. but it no longer helps. the feeling that nothing wi will get better, that i wi will be alone and a failure regardless of what i do to help eats at me everyday, little by little. i care for so many people and yet i feel as though they wouldn t even bat an eyelash if i was gone. that they would just go on with their lives. to an extent i know this is true but it is heartbreaking to know that they are only there because i offer something to them. whether its jokes or food i enjoy making or buying food for people , that is the only thing i can offer. i have had so many failed relationships. and while my friends and family tell me that it is not me, it is them, there has to be something i am not doing right or that is unattractive enough to end a long term relationship. and it hurts to think i wi will never find love while i am alive, or even have someone care about me for me. because i know they wi will leave eventually. the novelty wi will wear off, they wi will see my depression and know they can find something better in someone else. and that is the hardest thing i have had to come to terms with. i am a burden. a joke. a noucense that others tolerate, like a gnat you just can not get rid of. i think of dying every day, and i regret it in the morning when i did not just do it because i know i wi will just be in more pain by the end of the day. i have been told to cheer up, put on a mask. but after so long i do not have anymore energy to spend on trying to convince others i am happy. and it hurts to think that i am a bother just because i can not feel happy anymore. i can not be that girl with a big smile for others anymore. i would say i am sorry to thisappoint, but i have been used to thisappointing people all my life. i am not typing this for attention, or to be melodramatic. i need to say it somewhere where i can try to hope someone wi will understand without hurting my friends and family in the process. i need this pain to stop, and this is my last resort. the only thing keeping me going is my cat, who i wi will worry he wi will not have a home or people to love hi am if he doesnt have me. and that is so pathetic to say that it hurts to type it. i am sorry for the rant. for the long details that no one wants to hear. this wi will be deleted soon. i just want someone to know and hopefully understand.	moderate

ok for a minute the fun thing about depression is you can feel ok one minute and empty and lifeless the next...and all the ropes are just waiting to be cut, untwisted or dropped because everyone is heard it all before...and most people only check up on you when you re not ok as someone who has survived hanging herself, you d think i would have my shit together after years of therapy ...but no...i do not the worst part is knowing i could do it again and the only things i can think of people saying are that i was selfish and attention seeking...but those words would be as temporary as the ti ame it takes for my body to become lifeless again it really sucks trying to get better and feeling like you only are a burden even when you re self sufficient	moderate

i almost ki willed myself tonight so i want this to be known, i cook a ton, i love to cook food. so at christmas weird i am an atheist but sti will celebrate the birth of christ. reason why is because my mom denies me choice of atheism. yet she wi will sti will believe a bearded man in the sky...and i am the crazy one.. i just want free shit k? my mom got me a knife set. chefs knife, and all sorts of knives. the smallest one is the one i mainly use, since it is the dullest and i always get cut with the chefs knife. anyway. i have become more careful around sharp objects ever since i stabbed myself to the bone with a pen... i did not know why i did it. i just felt like i should. i just thought i would want to. it was not a ton of blood but it was one of the coldest days in louisiana it gets to about degrees someti ames. some days it is hot, the next it is cold. you think i am joking but no. it is crazy cli amate changing shit. but when i got home, and a lot warmer, after a shower, my stab wound opened and could not stop bleeding. i stayed away from anything sharp enough to cut me. scissors, knifes, and i switched to those dumb led pens. i tried to stop myself from being around those things. i am not very closed about my depression as i should be. that is good i guess. i am open to everyone about it. even the girl i like knows this shit. i have social anxiety but i can handle talking to her and stuff like that, but not tell her i like her. i am off topic. any way. they closed my school for the month because of the corona virus pandemic, it just made it is way to louisiana. i m a bit scared of it. but at least i wi will be apart of something. not to mention more people recover than die from it, so i amma be fine. nd i am in the age group that is more likely to get it. and i think everything happens for a reason. so i would normally take in to account every single possible scenario and think of a way out. or a way to avoid it. but being away from my band members, and away from asking the girl i like out, and maybe never finding love got me into serious depression. i do not believe in the thing everyone has someone. because of my philosophical thinking... so i used the sharpest knife i have and stabbed my hand. obviously, it left a big mark. so i have been hiding it from my mom. i do not want to hear her christion bull shit. or her yelling how dumb i am for stabbing my self with no reason. so i have been taking advantage of the pandemic and told my mom i felt sick. she was a little paranoid of the corona outbreak and remembered the pamphlet that the school brought home with out report cards. all sick people should stay in bed to rick the possible outcome of getting the covid virus. i am smart in thinking of a way to out smart my mom. and take advantage of things like that, btw, i take a bath every night, so whipping the blood off was extremely easy, and me not being a fucking dumbass, i know how to apply bandages and shit like that. i treated the mark like any other, a shit ton of rubbing alcohol, and bandages. funny thing after all the blood and stuff washed away, it was not as big as i thought. my depression is slowly turning into loss of sanity. at least i could use that in my band since i write the lyrics, and i play the bass. i can really control the band. there is a reason i call us the drop of the psychos. i have the stage name psycho. kinda weird to have a stage name and be proud of the name then being made fun of. they used to call me psycho when i would scream or make random outbursts. i do not know where my sanity is going, but i know it is not helping a single thing. except when i act on i ampulse, like stab my self i feel happy. only ti ame i have ever did. any ti ame i do what i feel like, i laugh or smile. i never do that with a cricked society holding me down. sorry. i go off topic a lot have not i? well bye.	moderate

what i do not tell people i do not tell people i get self harm thoughts, everyti ame i do it just seems to get me in trouble. i do not want them to worry but i also do not want to lie, and i know i would not act on any of them but they do not. they take it as i wi will and freak out about it. i tell no one because when i do they go to others and spread it so that i have to talk my way out of people pestering me on whether or not i wi will like ki will or cut myself. yes i am depressed and i think i can trust them enough to comfort me and then some pull this stunt and it makes me feel worse	moderate

i am so close to giving up. tonight was the cherry on top of the insane amount of depression i have been having. my husband and my father in law fist fought three ti ames tonight and each ti ame it was just my instinct to break them up, or try to. i am not skinny by any means, i am more on the chunkier side. but i didnt think, i just did. my only concern was protecting my husband. so, now my whole body is just.. drained, and it happened in front of my kids. they said they were just talking so i figured it was okay to take the kids to get some ice cream and calm them down. i did get hit. mainly in the head, probably thrown against a wall or two but i never stopped. we live with them and are working on moving out at the end of april. but whenever i got home, my husband just told me he needs me to clean more. to stop being lazy. and i am not. i clean and clean after my kids. i do everything for them and for my husband. if anyone needs anything, i am there for them. so after all that arguing, that is what i get. that i need to clean. there was no, i am sorry that happened. there was no let us talk to my parents so you can feel better about it. nothing. just, clean. like it was all my fault somehow. lately. things have been hard for me. i am trying to hold on. i am trying to just keep my head up. but everyone is against me. and i am just, tired. i want to take my kids and run but i can not. i almost cut tonight but didnt because i didnt want to thisappoint my kids. i am spiraling downward and it isnt stopping.	moderate
hopefully temp. hi everyone, i honestly lack the motivation in writing too much about myself which is prob a sign for depression but i just want to get this out to someone because there is no one i can talk to about this. i was supposed to write my college essay and submit all of them by the deadline yesterday. i did not. i used my three months trying to write it but i can not get myself to write it. all my family and friends are awaiting me to transfer and move on in life and they do not really know that i did not actually apply for the fall. i am not proud of myself and i do not feel like i am ready for it. i have felt like this since december and it is just gotten more agonizing. the truth is, i am closeted, i have more serious anxiety than i thought, i am too much in my head. i had so many friends over the year and i lost them, ghosted them, because i am just scared and tired for no reason. this is going to sounding a brag but i am telling you i wish i could treat it like one, everyone has high standards for me academically. i have been in newspaper articles like the nyt and accepted to selective extracurricular programs and my academics are great. but everyone wants me to continue what i have been doing which is help them with events and so many other stuff i am just tired of it. and they basically force me to do things i do not want to do. saying, hey i know you re super busy but this means a lot for the students. many of them tell me to apply to brown or harvard, because they went there or it would make the school look good. they even went far enough as to get a meeting with them, which i really did not want and just wasted his ti ame. i do not want to go to those schools because i do not like the environment. so now i am fucking tired and anxious all the ti ame and i am just trying to let it out that i did not apply to anywhere to everyone i know. all i want to do is travel and continue my passion of just trading and researching stocks which i have been doing and love. i do not want school, i am so tired of being told to do what is expected of me. but i do not want to be a dick and i do not want to be despised.	moderate
hello honestly, i feel hopeless. when i was in grade i was a good person, everyone in the whole elementary school was my friend. now, in th grade i have friends, who know maybe next year, i wi will have no one. i kind of lean on them, they keep me grounded in reality. my best friend is moving this year, so next school year, i wi will only have one friend. i am starting to get the sense that my other friend hates me. i think that is good, i am a terrible person. i have no idea why he hangs out with me at all, i am a waste of space. if he told me, that he hated me, he would be doing me a favor. he, next year, wi will be my only reason to live. ya know, i can not sleep. i have a difficult ti ame sleeping. my mistakes keep me awake every night, i never should have spoken. my mom and dad got divorced in , and i have moved to different schools. maybe that is why i am so much more, independent, quiet, alone, depressed. i dream of being murdered, at least it wi will be something interesting happened to me. i am just a piece of shit, and i wi will die a piece of shit. death is a funny thing, is not it? people do not give a damn about you when you are alive, but when you are dead you get some sort of appraisal for when you were alive. maybe i am better off dead, but i wi will wait for m and c to leave me. maybe then i wi will just shoot myself in the temple. i would grad my father mm barretta and put bullet into the magazine, then i would load it, then i would cock, press it against the back part of my temple, then pull the trigger, the striker strikes the pri amer, then the small piece of led goes through my brain, destroying my brain stem and destroys my vertebrae, exiting through my next. oh, what fun!	moderate

average why does my life suck? why do i fight and fail against a futile existance that, literally, has no meaning in the grand scheme of things? everyone says that everyone matters, but they do not. people die constantly and no one bats an eye to it. just in reading this, at least people must have died. and what were you doing? typing this? reading this? nothing matters and nothing is sacred. people die on christmas, haunekah, new years. every day. nothing is special. you are not special. you are not the final piece of the puzzle you are not mr. right you are not, in any form, a choosen one. you wi will wake up, brush your teeth, go into work, mess everything up, come back home, mess everything up again, then go to bed. no one wi will remember you for the good things. all anyone wi will remember you for is the fuck ups so they can turn to you and say, phew, at least my life is not as screwed up as that guy s. comfort is just a means of feeling superior to someone. compassion is just a self serving lie that gives you the dopamine hit of feeling, for a brief singular moment, that something you do actually is meaningful. it is not. the person wi will forget. people wi will forget. pointless, dumb, and meaningless. at least you had a good childhood. but even then that is just a set up for failure. a childhood so bland and uneventful that it could be forgotten like a waking dream. pointless. you can not write on a college entrance paper i grew up in an average household with an average family who averagely loved each other and expect to get anywhere. average. is there a more detestable word in the english language? if you are average at something, you did not do well or bad enough to be remembered, to have anyone care about it. average car, average kids, average wife, average job, average life. you begin to wonder if anything you do wi will make an i ampact at all. and you start to think of one thing that could.	moderate

i am feeling depressed but i am unsure how critical my situation is. so i am felling depressed in the last weeks moth and i think it is getting worse. i had some problems in the last few years. i started studying two and a half years ago. altough i passed all my exams unti will now my motivation for studying is fading away. i had high ai ams like becoming a professor but i realized that i can not reach them because i am just not good enough. i saw people who are much more better than me and i know that is normal but the fact that i was always the worst in terms of marks really depressed me and lead me rethink weather i am good enough for working in my field. at the moment i have fears about my future. i am consindering to change my study subject. i am thinking about how to end my studies as fast as possible so that i can work and support my family. but i am worrying about weather i am able to finish my studys. as i said i am not that good at studying and when i fail tests serveral ti ames the last years work would be for nothing. moreover, i have sleeping issus and when i try to sleep i start thinking about my future and it stresses me. someti ames i get strange feeling inside me. it feels like emptyness but also it is some kind of digging . difficult to describe. also, other days i am feeling down, nervous and motivationless. when i am with friends i am feeling better but when i am alone preassure starts building. i am thinking to go to a therapist but i am unsure if it would help me and if my situation is critical enough.	moderate

the first step toward my recovery was admitting i needed help sounds clich , trust me i know, but it is become a clich for a reason. i am the stubborn kind, specially when it comes to issues concerning myself or people that i love i seem to always think i know exactly what is wrong and how it can be fixed. so much so that a week ago i decided it was better to go to the er to get a very minor symptom checked rather than waiting to go to my family doctor the next day. i went to them three ti ames the same week because i was worried about my fucking bowel movements .. so unaware of my tendency to project my mental struggles on my body. the funny thing about all of this is that if someone had pointed that out to me i would have denied it without a second thought, not wanting to believe that i like to concoct scenarios that stray my own attention away from my real struggles. so that is why i decided to write. to gain some clarity for myself for once. no bullshit, just unfiltered thoughts pouring out of me.. and halfway through was when it clicked for me. the ti ames my parents had tried to get me out of bed, to get me up for school, or the texts i would receive throughout the day from my closest friends asking where i was and why i was not there.. it became clear that they all knew way before me how horribly depressed i was. i was not fooling anyone except myself. i could not get help because i did not know how to admit to myself how badly i wanted to mute the thoughts in my head. how i did not know how to trust myself or my opinions, my values, my emotions. so many ti ames id rather not feel anything than to feel something because i thought my emotions were so invalid, minuscule and uni amportant . and i was so sure everyone felt the same way. it is crazy to think how many people i would use as anchors to enable these shitty views of myself and my self esteem. i liked to focus on other people because that way i could ignore my own inability to express what i felt and how i dealt with myself.. which was doing absolutely nothing. i would do nothing for my own good.. i would do it for the sake of my parents or my friends or my growing hunger for stability. it was always a race to see how far i would make it before collapsing into my bed for three days straight with my lights off and often a show in front of me or a book in my hand , telling myself i would deserved the break because i would exhausted myself the week before it and that was true. my highs are always fi willed with days of me spending ti ame outside and with my friends. school and work and parties and hangouts .. anything that would stop me from going home. that is what i love, and also what i hate when i crash. because that is when i overthink every detail of my life. from my acne prone skin to my too skinny face or my slanted nose, how did i would looked in a picture or how i would reacted to a situation . all running through my head at a speed that would be exhausting , so i would rather turn it off by focusing on something or someone else , fictional or non fictional. i guess that is also when i developed my eating thisorder. when i would refuse to eat even a bite, lay in bed and starve because i would eaten too much the past week. i would spent my meal points for the week so i had to make up for it somehow, right? how else could i keep the only redeeming quality about myself? how else could i justify the amount of ti ames i would kneeled on the washroom floor to hurl after a night out? all that work could not go to waste of course. i was so blind to it all. i used to think i had a digestion problem and that is what i would get nauseous after every meal.. it was better to relieve it than to deal with the nausea the entire day.. wouldn t you agree? yet again, i am sure the only one i was able to keep fooled was myself. i hope my point did not get lost in between all my ramblings. this is the real danger of writing purely and without any filters someti ames you forget what you wanted to get to in the first place. i guess what i want to get at is how so incredibly relieving it became once i saw it for myself. without the beer goggles on, without the denial clouding my judgement. i needed help. i took a long ti ame to get it because i thought i could work out my laziness . but i never did. not until i got some ti ame for myself without worrying about school or maintaining an a social life. when i got to finally thinking. starting therapy and seeing a dietitian was the best decision i could have made for myself, by myself. nobody except me could have forced me to see how fragile i would become.. i am just glad it was not too late.	moderate

i do not want to live in a world where i am unwanted and treated as a mistake i want to die, short story of it. i am planning my suicide but i want to do it in the quickest way possible. i am fed up of being told just wait a little longer and it wi will get better. i have been waiting for it to get better for almost years and it is not getting better. i am trying everything to try and see the positive side. i took up evening classes, i am attending university to try and make a better life but just when i think i can make it then i am promptly reminded that someti ames not everyone has a good life. and that is okay, life is not fair and i am just one of those people who people wi will say oh, it is a shame she died so young. why did not she reach out? i did reach out, i did the antidepressants, i had the counselling. i tried i really really did and i hope i can be remembered for really trying. it may be a while before i do actually ki will myself while i plan it out. i think the part i hate the most about it is how i wi will be considered some sort of tragedy and my family wi will be pitied. yet people do not know they are the reason i am planning on ki willing myself. i can not cope with being a failure. i am years old and sti will being abused but i can not do anything about it at all. i can not even approach services because i am not a priority. i tried though, i really did try to get better but i do not want to be alive and suffering anymore. i know people have it worse and they are living their to their best as they can but i am just not that strong.	moderate

it does not get better, it gets worse... i am just hoping that something, one little thing wi will make me genuinely happy or change how things are going, and nothing does. i have too many demons and current problems to fight on a daily basis. pretending to be getting happier for my husband is ki willing me. i am drowning in pain right now and i just want to go back to being numb and in a daze like i have been for the last few weeks. it always goes back to the numbness, someti ames i have to completely lose my mind first, but it never goes back to being okay. or good. it is never really been good. maybe i can name a handful of minutes in my existence i could label as good or happy , but everything else has been pain or numbness. i just feel like i am worthless and i should not be here on a daily basis. i know for a fact my family would be better off without me. i do not need any of the but you do this bull, because i do not. everything i do, what little it is, could easily be done by someone else and in a happier tone and quicker. at least once a month i cry so hard i practically drown myself. it feels like i am breathing underwater and my whole body hurts for days after. i am worthless, i can barely move after besides typing or scrolling through things to try and find something to numb the pain. someone who has it worse than me, which is everyone, because my pain is worthless since i am worthless. i just do not feel like anything is ever going to be slightly okay ever and i do not want to keep guessing if it wi will be.	moderate

depression bingo this past few months has been one thing after another and i feel like there is a shitty events bingo card out there with my name on it and i am way out ahead to take the prize of a flaming bag of dog shit. got dumped by text by the love of my life for an arranged marriage, my genetic thisease became incredibly crippling, my landlord fucked up and nearly got me evicted over a paperwork error on their end, got raped, picked up a stalker, got told repeatedly at work nobody wants to work with me because of my thisability, so called friends had me dragged away by the police and thrown into the psych cell, lost my job, got thrown in the psych cell again, and i might have cancer. what the fuck is left? i am all for what does not ki will you makes you stronger and all but at this point i should be able to bench press a god damn minivan. i was at my job for years and they are clai aming corporate restructuring but that is total bullshit, they fired me because of my thisability. the job posting for my job was up on the board minutes after they fired me. with no job i lose my benefits, including the dollars k of drugs a year i need. i have to stop taking my antidepressants, arthritis drugs and migraine meds. i am basically going to be lying on my floor barely able to function in about three weeks, not that i am super functional now. do not know what to do next. realistically i am too sick to work full ti ame but i am single and i do not really have a choice. thisability would pay about of my rent, leaving me short on rent and nothing for food, transportation, utilities or other bi wills, so that is not an option. i am so tired and in so much pain all the ti ame. the thought of looking and interviewing for a new job is more than i can take. i wish they had fired me when it was sti will truly winter so i could have got super drunk and passed out on the balcony and frozen to death. i nearly did it anyway but i sti will had a shred to hold on to. i do not have anything left to lose anymore.	moderate
i am at a crossroad... i am a year old male. i have been suffering from anxiety and periodic panic attacks for years. although i seem like a happy genuine and likeable guy on the surface i have been fighting with anxiety and panic below the surface. like a duck who seems to float peacefully on the surface on the water but is kicking below the surface of the water just to prevent itself from sinking. months ago i decided to just stop resisting the panic and anxiety and just let is wash over me. i am tired of fighting, there is no more energy left. for years i have been trying to look at life from a bright perspective but i can not do it anymore. ever since that decision months ago a feeling of depression crawling over me. for the past week these waves of depression and hopelessness came up so strong that i feel like i am thisassociating i can only lie down and undergo the feeling, like i am smothered by dread and terror. for the past days or so i have been entertaining the thought of suicide. i do not see a way out of this, and if this wi will be the quality of my life for the rest of my life i do not feel like riding it out. i sti will have grams of cocaine yeah... do not ask me why... which i have considered thissolving into a glass of water and drink all at once. on the one hand i feel that i should not do it but on the other hand the feeling of dread and terror are so goddamn intense that i just do not care anymore.	moderate
it is crazy how depression is treated like a joke. it is crazy how tens of thousands of people ki will themselves every year. people care so much about shit like coronavirus because it can actually ki will them, but nobody cares about depression because they know that they do not have it or can not get it. some people are just permanently in complete despair at all ti ames for years at a ti ame and nobody cares or helps them because severely depressed people usually do not have many friends or loved ones anyways and then they get called selfish when they finally end their own lives. people do not think much of it because it just sounds like sadness which everyone experiences, but people do not understand what it is like to constantly hate every second of every day and hate everything about yourself. and everyone wi will just tell you bullshit like it gets better which it does not by the way, it gets worse and worse with every single day and nobody cares. i do not know why i am typing this, i just sat in my room for like hours and idk.	moderate

struggling with depression and add i wanted to share my story and hopefully people can relate and have the courage to share their story as well. i can first pinpoint when i started to experience depression about a year ago. i had just left a place where i felt like was happiest about a year and a half ago and from there i only seemed to spiral downhi will. i went from somewhere where i knew everything about the medical system on my state as i was born with turner syndrome and as part of that add as well, to somewhere where i have to explain my situation again and try to find a psychiatrist who wi will prescribe me add medication. over the last year and a half, i have struggled with dealing with how i am. i believe my depression has been caused by my add and the struggles i face daily. as those who have add, you know more than anyone what a pain in the ass it can be to have. it has taken its toll on me and it has gotten to me over the past year than it has my whole life. it has affected every aspect of my life from basic daily functioning to bouncing from job to job because my employers do not understand add and it is something very sensitive and not something i want to explain. i am feeling the pain and struggle of not knowing how i am going to function as an adult in this world. i want nothing more than to have a full ti ame job that i love and being independent. what is making me so depressed is that i do not know when or if that wi will happen for me. all i want is to be able to provide for myself. i struggle with the fact that these things come so easy to others but for me seems so difficult. i get easily thisappointed whenever i forget something, can not seem to hold down a job or can not seem to get anything accomplished. i am sensitive to rejection and it seems to affect me more than the average person. i know not everyone has it figured out at twenty but i do not want to be a forty year old living with my parents and relying on them. do not get me wrong, i love my parents but someti ames they do not seem like they truly understand. my dad in particular is my main struggle in my relationship and he does not have much patience or understanding and sti will years since my diagnosis does not understand how add works and affects me. i am constantly hearing from hi am that what i do is never enough which i believe has affected my self i amage and esteem and if i am being honest, i am tired of constantly having to legiti amise myself and feeling like i am never enough.	moderate

seeing your doctor first, versus looking up therapists i am just wondering who can weigh in on their experience of making an appointment with your pcp to say you re experiencing depression or anxiety, versus going online to search for what looks like either a good therapist for your specific concerns and or an affordable one. i assume they refer you to someone somewhere locally while bringing up possibly coming back to the office if medication becomes suggested? are they supportive and appreciative that you came to hi am her regarding your mental health they did not make you feel more awkward about it? i have just been doing nothing re seeing a doctor or therapist because just getting the ball rolling would easily be pushing a thousand dollars on top of more credit card debt, insurance does not cover anything before you pay the dollars deductible first and my first two therapists were terrible when i was so excited to finally be getting therapy with high hopes, so i do not have much confidence in throwing money at it a third ti ame, but praying to god about how much i wish i were dead is getting to be too much. anyway, i guess i am just wondering what your insights are on seeing the md for depression first. i am also aware with what is going on right now, i can not do this any ti ame soon anyway, but i am severely depressed again and just trying to seek some sense of community about it versus something more damaging.	moderate

anyone else getting a little depressed from this virus situation? last year was the worst of my life. delayed college graduation, my girlfriend of four years left me, i wanted to commit suicide couple of ti ames. this year i wanted a fresh start and restart my life. i would wake up early, meditate, read, enhance myself, work on graduation, etc. i went crazy in the gym, etc. then one of my ideals died kobe, which made me very sad for the whole week. i then used the mamba mentality as fuel to become the man i want to mentally and financially. then this god dam virus hits and at first i thought it wouldn t be that bad, but now i am starting to feel depressed. this is not from the virus itself , but from how it affects us. no sports, no events, the stores are empty, people are fighting, can not cough or touch anyone, everyone is on edge. i feel like something drastic wi will happen this year and i am worried. and it just pains me to see all this going on. i can not go to the gym now and i am losing some motivation to work on myself. i see china and sk handle the situation, but in the us, i am not opti amistic. i am looking on reddit everyday to see some sign of good news. i know it would not end the world but it is hard for me to be focused and to be happy during these ti ames.	moderate

i just had a mental break down and was debating self harm so, it is currently am at the ti ame of writing this. i have been almost nonstop crying for about an hour. i was crying about all the bad things i have going on in my life. a lot of things that have been negatively affecting me and how i function have been happening recently and i have not been able to keep up with it. i have been crying a lot more recently as well. i had not cried for about months until weeks ago when i cried myself to sleep. then a couple days later. i almost cried during school. and it does not help that i was sick for days and did not see my friends. i just do not really know what to do anymore. when i was crying, i went to go get water from my bathroom sink and when i looked in the mirror, i thought i look so much prettier with tears in my eyes, it really makes them pop, why do not i help make the look more complete with some blood or cuts . then i started to cry even harder and took my water and ran to my bed. i am scared of myself now and what might happen as ti ame goes on. i am scared my problems wi will get worse everyday and i wi will loose all my control over my sadness. i have felt it slipping from me. it was like this a couple months ago but i do not want to talk about those days. it is to far away. i just want to be happier. and all of this may be because of wacky teenage hormones but i am sti will worried about it. i am sorry if this was confusing. it was mainly just to trying to get me to calm down. and it worked. i need to go to bed now. goodnight morning reddit. and sorry again if this was really confusing and hard to read. i wi will try to clarify later if questions are asked. goodbye.	moderate
i do not think i have much left in me. my fianc e left me because of my depression, i see my kids a lot sti will, but she took them as well. she left me with the unfinished house so i am paying of the mortgage and requested child support while trying to finish the house myself because i can afford to pay professionals to finish it, then sell it, even though she wi will sti will get half. i am doing everything i possibly can to keep going, i work full ti ame, though i hate my job, i exercise everyday i take my meds. but everything i try and do snowballs to shit. life just keeps kicking me while i am down and i just do not know how much longer i can go. i feel so guilty because i would never do that to my kids but i am just so exhausted in every way from putting in so much effort to fix myself but everything going wrong. i have been used chewed up and spat out and now i am just stuck to the ground.	moderate
why does food always work for my depression i have tried medication, therapy, and i even went to a crisis center to get help with my depression. but the medication did not work, i felt like my therapist was not helping that much, and i felt more depressed at the crisis center because there were people there who were worse off than me. even before i got professional help, i would always rely on food to make me happy and it always did. every ti ame i eat, i feel so much better. even though, people call me a pig and tell me to lose weight, i do not give a f. as long as i do not get obese, i just want to rely on food. it is the only thing that makes me happy. having friendships with people does not make me happy as they just betray me and i regret putting all that effort in just to pretend that i am okay. i think that i wi will be fine off alone.	moderate
family members that i hardly know me telling me to stop being depress. okay so i grow up with almost zero close family besides both my parents and sister and just one uncle, most other family members are in a different country. just grow up with nd and third cousins. but about a month ago i heard my dad talking on the phone with my uncle or some family member i have never meet. telling them how i just stay in my room all day and do not do much. also i work from home do not have a fix schedule. he handed me the phone and had to talk to this person i never meet telling me how i need to get a girlfriend how i should go out more often. obviously he was telling me this cause he cares but if you know how it feels to be unmotivated and depress that is the last thing you want to hear specially from people you never meet. yet my dad has never talked to me about how i am feeling or if i am okay. and last night another uncle that i never meet told me the same shit the first uncle told me. i was feeling happy the past month now that i know my entire family probably knows i am a depress year old is not really helping me whatsoever. i do not want to make a big deal about this but how do i tell my dad to stop telling everyone my business. also both of them did not tell me stop being depress, but the way they talked to me was pretty much the same thing.	moderate
hi there. i can not face the day when i wake up. i spend most of my ti ame that i am not at work in bed doing nothing, but around friends and family i act all chi will but inside i feel empty. at work, i spend half my ti ame just staring at the computer, i do not do my studying or anything really, i am just not motivated. i have a doctor is appointment in a couple if weeks, but i know i wi will downplay how i feel and put on a happy front. i am near breaking point, and i do not know what to do. i feel trapped and there is no one i can, or wi will talk to. everything just feels meaningless and cold and empty.	moderate
do not know the questions. they are there. they are asked. all the ti ame. what are you going to do after this? after school? after moving out? after becoming an adult? oh, need not you worry, for i have the meticulously composed socially acceptable answer for you, an answer that wi will, with repeated regurgitations, surely make me believe it myself. yes, of course i know where i am going and yes, i am looking forward to my future. why wouldn t i be? i have a good life, with a wonderful family and an opportunity for good education. i sti will live at home with my parents. i barely have any expenses or daily stresses to worry about, and i have not dealt with any particular hardships that would seriously affect me. truly, i have no idea what i am doing here. i am okay, i am. very much so. better than okay, actually. i am great, i am. i really should be. so i do not know why i sti will feel like this i am typing away on here at in the morning because i can not find the energy to sleep. i am too tired to sleep. this is not the first ti ame, and it would not be the last. i do not get it. it should t be like this. i have no reason to feel like a spectator in my own body, watching me get in my own way, dually mocking and pitying myself. what are you doing? i do not know. i do not. what am i doing? why am i here? there is nothing wrong with me, so why am i slapping all of this onto a subreddit dedicated to those who actually need it? all i can answer is, i do not know , and i hate that. i fell like that is the culmination of my being. a big, tired, useless, i do not know.	moderate

getting help i wish depression would be treated just like any other i willness. like if people would treat depression the way they treat a broken bone or a ruptured appendix i would have no problem asking for help. it is the fact that my depression has made me feel like less of a human being that is preventing me from getting help. agh this sucks	moderate
is there any place i can find reliable information on how to successfully commit suicide? i wouldn t be able to recover should i ever try and fail. i would just keep trying over and over and over again. if i could, because i suppose people kinda get onto you after they realize you re for real when you say i want to die. . and that would only make matters a thousand ti ames worse, because i feel like my life would not be my own if i do not have the right to end it. i do not want to live just because other people may want me to. i am not asking for help. i am asking you to help me die. in peace. just pm me if accurately replying to my question would violate the sub is rules and i am fairly sure this post itself does? .	moderate
i can not motivate myself to do anything that involves leaving my house i f used to always be working two jobs, going on trips, or just generally never home but for the past year and a half i have been a unemployed stay at home homemaker to my bf after working shitty jobs made me incredibly depressed due to having no free ti ame, but now that i have all the ti ame in the world i am sti will depressed and just never leave the house unless it is a spur of the moment quick grocery run. i can not ever see myself seeing a therapist because money and there is no way i could see myself not being a lazy piece of shit and actually go to more than one session. it is to the point where i have had incredibly painful joint pain daily for over a year that a normal person would have seen a doctor for i ammediately, but nope not me i wi will just keep telling myself one day i wi will set up a appointment and even if i did when it came around i would just not go. i am so fatigued all the ti ame and spend everyday just watching videos, overthinking every aspect of myself, smoking weed, it was like this before weed and playing the same video games i have for years because even though i would love to pick up a new game even that is too exhausting. i hate myself so much for becoming like this just doing nothing with my life but i do not know how to break it. even if i wanted to do something, i live in a incredibly shitty rural town where there is nothing but grocery stores and even that is a min drive.	moderate

i thought i was okay, but i am really not alright so, i have been feeling like this for quite a while. i do not know if it is depression, i did not have it diagnosed, but it might be. i just wanted to share with somebody. i was alright after i moved. i really was. then it all started spiraling down again. i do not feel okay, i feel that nobody likes me. not really. i feel underappreciated and like everything i do is in vain, because nobody cares. i do not know if the reason i try so hard is to prove other people i am not a piece of shit or that i am not useless, or to prove it to myself. i feel so lost and i do not even know why, because i have almost everything a person needs. i should be happy. but the only thing i feel like is crying, and it is like nothing is inside me anymore just guilt someti ames for things i should not even feel guilty about because they are normal, and someti ames a deep sadness. what hurts the most is, i thought i would changed and that i was finally okay. but i tried everything and there is nothing i can do to make myself feel better, or whole, or like something is not fucking wrong with me. because i am pretty sure i am broken, like, something in my head might be wired in the wrong way. also, please do not suggest that i talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, because i am financially unable to. i have contacted someone who offers some thiscount under certain circumstances, and the person said they would contact me when they have an available spot, but that was three months ago and they did not contact me yet.	moderate

i have terrible luck with therapy. i been waiting for months. i had to wait months for an appointment. a week before my appointment they had to re schedule it for a month since my therapist was going on vacation. i just went to my first session last week and it just got canceled until atleast mid april due to corona virus. this fucking sucks. i quit therapy last ti ame years ago because i was kinda ping ponged between different therapist. i am so mad.... i am trying to get my life together and now i just have to sit here again. i understand covid .... i am just ranting about my bad luck.	moderate
i am not sure how much longer i can last. the last year has been so terrible, everything has gone to shit and i am just not happy anymore. things changed in january when i met this girl that i really fell for, she is now my girlfriend, but i have not met her in weeks due to me being on a school trip to spain, and then i got quarantined for weeks because of said trip. this last week and the first week of my quarantine has been terrible. i have had no social life and it has been hard not to see my girlfriend for so long. sitting inside all day has just given me ti ame to overthink everything happening in my life and i just can not take it anymore. and to make matters worse, by girlfriend got quarantined on saturday so i would not be able to see her for atleast another weeks. and by that ti ame my overthinking has probably got to me and i have become an emotional mess, more so than what i am at the ti ame of writing this. this entire situation is driving me insane.	moderate
my current conditions i am in a country where depression is like a pseudo concept or something, people do not believe in it. they think being sad depression that is why everyone uses word depressed when they are actually sad. i hate these kind of people with bottom of my heart. there is li amited to none ski willed therapists here i used ski willed cause there are s of fake degree holders so people with depression do not get any treatment. even if anyone is lucky enough to find a therapist, they wi will charge you very high. people who commit suicide here due to any particular reason are considered coward in the society and their family is blamed to not be able to raise them properly. depressed people are considered unlucky for society and are left alone a lot of ti ame. i do not know if i have depression or not but i have been in an apathetic state constantly for around years now. i do not get any emotions but someti ames i feel like crying. but i try to do my best not to show anything to people around me and have a fake smile always on even if i am having a very hard ti ame holding that smile. i am a student so i try to focus on my studies but can not do that. i try to divert my mind and go on a spree of binge watching shows, movies or videos for hours and hours. i know i would not commit suicide ever but i think i would not be able to escape this state of constant unwanted sadness my whole life.	moderate
everyday life is a hollow, meaningless stage of existence... everyday, i wake up.. before i have my first thought, i think why am i sti will here? its become a hollow point of meaningless everyday bullshit... i am tired of waking up and forcing myself to smile and wear a mask of a healthy face to others so i can mask my own mental suffering and torment. i have had many thoughts of death and suicide, as well as the ideation of self death... listening to music and watching videos online relating to how i feel because it somehow makes me validated in my self decay. i have pushed away many in my life and now i sit alone in my room, wasting days and nights of this mediocre life. family is what i have left, a singular thread that keeps me anchored to this life and that is also starting to fade.. i have been seeing a doctor for a diagnosis and hopefully they can provide me with some form of remedy for this... if not, there i wi will be endowed by the choice of suicide.. maybe not today, or tomorrow but someday down the line when i am weary enough to end my life.. i sort of envy those that have passed before me and i wi will soon follow suit as they have had the strength to carry out their own demise... i just turned , and yet everything in life has become nullified, dull, with no sense of purpose or meaning...	moderate
 successfully joined r depression! and is not that depressing? i am a writer at heart, as clumsy and thisjointed as the results are. here is something i drudged up, fit more for a journal than for the eyes of strangers, but if you d care to read it go ahead. it started out being about a chronic, compulsive procrastinator is flaws and excuses, but changed into something more. maybe you d see something familiar, but maybe not. i do not know if that means good things for you or for me. the boy who feels or, instead of being productive, here i am i wonder how deep the fault lies, heavy and comfortable and there. contrary to my complaints, to my criticisms, the unfair sharpness of my judgements, i have always been an opti amist. or perhaps i was just arrogant. i sti will am. it shows in my recklessness, my i ampulsiveness. in nights not spent studying and a wandering mind behind the wheel. it speaks of a carelessness that is selfish and detached and unkind. a non living thing, upon which life happens and nothing more. once, i believed it was si amply how i operated. half dreaming or perhaps half dead and stolen away by everything and anything that is si amply not here . in lieu of eyes, i saw fit to walk through life with my terrible, callow heart. instead of ears, i feel out the rhythm and the noise, the rise and fall and there i decide. i write and i talk and i think and i answer based on the churning of something inside of me i can not clearly name. on the sense of anticipation, such as before a drop or a fall or something equally dire and dramatic, that stays my hand and says wait . choose another. what else? something more. that is not it. start over. and someti ames. there. i have always trusted it. for everything. whether it is deciding on which path to take or what letter to choose, i have always relied on this inner knowing that i am nevertheless not privileged to unravel. it might just be what ki wills me, in the end. because with it, i never know when to stop. when to start thinking and not just acting and following and feeling. by blinding myself so wi willingly, i doom myself to never knowing until long after my foot missed the landing and i fall and fall and fall. it is arrogance of the highest kind. to trust so completely on the unknown and uncontrolled mechanisms of your own mind that you actually feel surprise when the answer it supplies turns out to be wrong. and someti ames, someti ames i use it to pick at reality. how far can i go before everything collapses? how deep can i twist the knife before my life is irreversibly, horribly destroyed? the origins of this strange fixation is long forgotten or si amply not made known to me. i do not know when the longing for the summery start of a hero is adventure corroded into a morbid fascination for the bitter, winter ending of a vi willain cut down, left to die alone and forgotten and unforgiven. i can not help the way my soul quails at the thought of pain, of suffering. but deeper sti will, i think a large part of me si amply knows that i deserve it. it is a conundrum, really. it is difficult to chase that suffering when there is so many variables at play. far too many people who have made the poor choice of getting attached, of investing their ti ame in something that is always waiting to be destroyed. the trappings of family and friends and innocent hearts too quickly broken. perhaps if i had been born in a different context, i could have done it easily. took the blade or stole the gun or locked the rooftop door behind me. it is si ample to i amagine, si ampler sti will to actually follow through. there would have been no regrets, i do not think, but how could i know? everything would have lined up so easily. i was already born to ki will myself i just need the right incentive. and yet, ti ame and ti ame again, something holds me back. such a terrible thing, conscience, how it keeps me caged and wanting. i am a man on borrowed ti ame, when is it going to run out? maybe i was never meant to survive my birth. the privilege certainly belongs to greater men and women than i my brother and my sisters, for one. perhaps they would have loved being alive. loved it better, stronger, far less selfishly. angel. messenger of god. mary grace. beloved to thank. bryan. noble. perhaps they would have cherished it, their names, and not grow to hate it and the ones who gave it to me, just a little like i have. perhaps they would have been happy and someti ames i think that i am si amply the result of their frustration from never really having the chance to live. after having fought so hard to exist, mine seems like a bitter sigh mistakenly given form after they have finally given up there is enough spite, i believe, to justify it. if they are with me, i would like to say that i admire their efforts to remain. the first few years of my life were naive yet blissfuly full of wonder and hope. far too many for a single child, someti ames, but maybe i was not. i just wish they experienced their lost childhood in a better way, for far longer, before i inevitably destroyed even that. light may filter down onto shadows but definition demands that only one of them exists in a single space at a ti ame. where there is light, there is no darkness where there is darkness, there is no light. si amilarly, though they may occupy me for a ti ame, it is obvious that their hold is not everlasting. i exist too. i miss their presence. they could have been happy and by extension, maybe i could have taken a little of that happiness for myself. stored it away, deep down, for when it needs to be there before possibility becomes it is done . i do wish to be happy, though i am slowly realising that it is less about opportunity and more about capacity. maybe it is my fault, maybe it is not. but then i never really do anything about it so maybe it is, after all. our counsellor said that i should stop thinking about it. would you believe that it actually works? of course, it does sear a little deeper, a little more violently each ti ame but it does remove its i ammediate presence. it makes me laugh a little to visualise it, the sheer ridiculousness of asking someone to close their eyes instead of teaching them to turn away from the cliff is edge. funnier sti will that i want to keep walking, the knowledge safely and sweetly tucked between my ribs. it would not break my fall, but is it so bad to not want it to?	moderate

my life is falling apart and i do not know what to do anymore self harm and sexual abuse triggers i was forced to come out to my family because someone i had told was going to out me. ever since my parents have been looking at me differently, i wi will notice side glances, i feel like they wish i was straight. my sister has always been in my corner, even against our own parents. she is always supported me, and i am so proud of how far she is come in life. if i can not feel comfortable as myself around my parents, who can i then? i found respite in a relatively new friend. he and i relate on a lot of things. ever since we started having serious conversations, we have become each other is emotional dumping grounds. we have been kind of charging each other up into a big bomb, i do not mind if i get caught in the explosion. i look at our relationship and i know it is not healthy for either of us. you know how there are somethings you do not talk about with people? we do not have that, we can go from memes to our sexual traumas in less than minutes. we kind of mesh in the least healthy way possible. i am an extremely anxious and depressed person, i wi will spend days on end locked in my room alone. i am not going to air out my friend is business because that is not my place. we lock into each other like puzzle pieces. we have been openly plotting our suicides together. it feels great to talk about planning on dying without hearing you have got your whole life ahead of you , for context neither of us are even , neither of us are younger than . i have noticed something about myself that is kind of been eating at me lately. with how much ti ame we spend talking to each other. i think i might be developing feelings for hi am? idk, i have just been feeling so validated because someone finally listens to what i have to say without judging me. he makes my chest feel tight, and that upsets me. i know nothing can happen between us because neither of us wi will be alive long enough for something to flourish. i just know that when my ti ame comes, i am going to shred my arm with my razor blades and fade out messaging hi am, if he is sti will alive when i do it. i fell back into cutting, and i have been fucking destroying my thighs over the last week after stealing a pack of razor blades. my most recent cuts are from minutes ago now. it is developed into a sort of addiction i think. i wi will be moodier than usual all day because i am looking forward to the night so i can lock myself in the bathroom and destroy my body without being interrupted. i am literally planning my days around my release at night. i tried to overdose recently, that puts me at attempt . i hope is much more effective, because i am tired of feeling empty. even before my family knew i was gay i was sti will the black sheep. mainly because of my interests. i have always had an affinity for the occult and true cri ame. i feel like my parents focused more on my other siblings rather than me. my older brother was always screaming and trying to fist fight my dad, he would punch holes in walls and try to manipulate us. my younger sister got attention because she was the youngest. because of my brother, loud noises and arguments freak me the fuck out. i was unremarkable and i did not cause problems. so i guess i faded into the back while they took up their ti ame. i had to grow up fast and i feel like i was robbed of a childhood. i was molested by my cousin for years through my adolescence. which fucked up my current sex life. i do not like being touched in certain areas. makes me cry and have anxiety attacks. it was happening like feet away from my entire i ammediate family, always behind that same bush at my grandparents home. it is not like she did not know that it was fucked up, she was old enough to know that fondling someone when they are saying no is wrong. i sti will feel small when i think about it, i feel small and scared and helpless. she sti will tries to text me, the last ti ame i saw her was months ago i believe. nobody except for my friend knows what she is done to me. typing that out made me want to slice the artery in my thigh. honestly the only good thing i have got so far this year is my friend. maybe under different circumstances, if we weren t so fucked up, maybe there could be something between us. it would not happen now, if there is an afterlife maybe things are better there. i just, need hi am around while i am sti will here. i do not know if i could be okay alone. i am barely alright now, so i do not know what i would do without hi am. my heart is breaking and i hate it, i should not feel this way for my friend. i want it to stop but i can not make it. why do i feel this way	moderate

i am deeply longing for my death!! i wish i could die calmly!! jus tired of everything! thissappointed at everyone and everything in my life! there is no shoulder i could relay on!! family and real life friends do not really care about my frelings. also i am struggling. i literally have no motivation to study i am always wasting ti ame on internet talking with people. because as soon as i open book all regrets and sad thoughts come up!! i am also losing my eye sight sight i think. even with specks i can not see longer thistances. and i suck at everything and i am socially awkward! wish god please take this life! i have asked you this a mi willion ti ames.. but you never granted this. hope you wi will grant this wish soon!	moderate
i want it all to end i want to ki will myself so much. but, i am too scared to do it and i do not want to hurt my parents. no one else would care. it is so hard living like this, i have no motive to be alive. it is painful living through one day. and there are in a year. and if i live as long as most, i wi will have to live another odd years. just to fuck me, there is an extra day every years. because the large amount i already live with was not enough. it is unfair that younger people have such a low mortality rate with covid . my one wish is too die in a way that would hurt my parents the least. i want help, or just someone to reach out and make me feel cared for. but, i know i wi will just be annoying if i reach out or ask someone to talk, i am too nervous and anxious to anyways. there is no joy in my life. i am going to be stuck in my home for weeks or so with my thoughts and i would not be able to go out with friends and feel happy for the short amount of ti ame i would be out and about. i feel so genuinely unfixable. no one can make me feel happy long enough or make a significan not enough i ampact that i start getting better. instead, i am slowly dying inside and it is getting worse on the daily. sorry for bothering anyone who read this. i should not have been so inconsiderate and posted this in the first place.	moderate
quarantined and depressed while isolation is my goal most days, being forced to isolate seems dangerous. my depression has been escalating for a while now and i have noticed myself isolating more. getting sick and being quarantined has amplified the isolation to become all encompassing. i know i need to talk to people but they wi will only worry. i would rather just get sick and die without anyone being the wiser. it saves them the misery and me the knowledge that i made people is lives worse than i already have. seems like a win win.	moderate

alone in my own darkness hi, new to reddit and not sure how this all works. i found this forum and thought it would be a good way to express how i am feeling, so here it goes. i have always been depressed and felt lonely, but there was a point in my life where i was happy, but things just started going downhi will in the matter of the passing year.i had a few friends and was content with a select few and we would talk all the ti ame and always go out, or i would spend ti ame with my boyfriend. last summer someone decided to be friends with my friends and got jealous and spewed lies and made me seem like such a bad guy when i am such a loyal friend. because of this person, i lost everyone who was close to me. people who i considered to be family just up and left me. i sti will had and have the companionship of my boyfriend, but at ti ames he just does not understand how i feel.during that ti ame it was summer and i had gone on vacation to try and relax.... summer had ended and it was now fall. i got sexually harassed at work and they did nothing, so i ended up quitting. sti will to this day i do not have a job. i could not tell you the countless interviews i have gone on and just no one wi will hire me, which puts me into a deeper depression. i do not know what to even think anymore. qualifications seem to not even be of i amportance anymore.then, i started looking for a pet dog as a companion and to make me feel less lonely, because i just sit at home all day with nothing and no one to talk to, but even trying to adopt a dog seems to not be working which just puts me back into a hole. i feel like i am slowly losing my mind and no one understands or if i express my feelings on facebook, it is annoying or asking for attention. when in reality all i want is someone to just listen and talk to me and make a friend and have that person who cares about me enough to check in on me or want to hang out with me. living with your spouse may seem like a you always have someone there with you, why are you so lonely situation, but i need more then just a spouse in my life. i need girlfriends or someone i can gossip with and grab coffee or go shopping. i would love to write more, but i just have that fear of being annoying and i honestly doubt anyone wi will read this, let alone reach out to make a friend but it is worth that chance. hope everyone has lovely day and that today is a lighter day for you! lt 	moderate

what can i do? hi, i am new to this subreddit, and i have a question to ask you all. i have mental heath problems, i do not know what those problems are because i have not been to a doctor, and nobody believes me when i say anything. the only person believes me even a little bit is my mom, saying she wi will schedule an appointment with a doctor, and then i wait for it for weeks and she does not say anything about it afterwards, and i am to scared she wi will brush me off just like everyone else to mention it again. most of my family members get mad at me for not interacting at family gatherings. i do not really talk with anyone because they seem to be doing their own little thing, only really talking to me when they need me. my question for you all is, what can i do? what help can i get? i wi will post a few more ti ames on here with updates if anyone cares.	moderate
depression my thoughts and experiences depression is hard to deal with!! trust me i know. i want to try and sum up in a few paragraphs what depression means to me and how i have learned to deal with it and understand it. if the cause of our depression is out of our control, we have to try and acknowledge the fact that life wi will throw us curve balls, takes the wind out our sails and pull the rug from under our feet when we least expect it. it is not about what happens to us it is about how we deal with it that matters. my depression has been caused not by uncontrollable life events, but by my own stupidity, my own poor decisions, my own si willy behaviour, my own horrific mistakes. my sadness was caused by nothing but myself. this is a much more bitter pi will to swallow but can sti will be fixed over ti ame. however our depression came about, it is our brain that is overwhelmed by negative thoughts. be it anger or self hate, suicide or self harm, past thistresses or consequences. negative thoughts are playing on a loop in our brain, the longer we allow the negative thoughts to continue the harder it wi will be to emerge from our depression. i know, trying to tell a person with depression to think positively sounds like a load of bullshit right? but introducing positivity is the only thing that wi will work. we have to try and see a positive way forward, where we exercise and eat nutritious food. where we hang out and laugh with friends. where we start to love and care for the people around us or picture ourselves with a new partner and finally move on from that emotional break up. for me, when i am at my lowest i would lose my appetite and wouldn t go to the gym. i would lose muscle mass and start to look skinny. when i did eat it was just junk food to make the hunger go away. my sleeping pattern was lost and i had dark circles under my eyes. i stopped cleaning my house and allowed it to get messy and unhygienic. i stopped seeing friends and family and cancelled plans because i looked horrific. my job suffered and my finances took a hit. no matter how bad things appear we should try to remain positive in the i amportant areas of our life. depression wi will come and go but our health and hygiene can deteriorate quick when we do not look after ourselves. building up from rock bottom each ti ame is difficult, try to avoid hitting rock bottom by staying positive enough to look after ourselves well. laying in a dark room and obsessing over events that happened last week, last month or last year wi will get us nowhere, a nutritious meal and phone call to a friend wi will get us somewhere. allow positivity in and slowly our depression wi will ease. thanks for reading.	moderate

i do not know if this belongs here, but i need someone to hear me few days ago, i had an existential crisis. i had a panic attack. i know how to deal with one calm down, calm down, it is going to be over sooner than you think . it worked for a few moments, but then my mind went out of control. i was thinking that everything is useless and has no meaning, and even that no meaning means to give a meaning way of thinking couldn help at all. it was kind of a psychotic episode. this was probably bcs a lot of stuff, but what kept me in that horrible mood was my thoughts. i have read some of existentialism and absourthism, and even watched bit of rick and morty yes, that high iq show haha , and i feel like not even death has meaning. no life has meaning. meaning has no meaning. i feel not empty, just full of void. i am scared of the existence. i am scared that nothing, even the nothingness is meaningless. i went to the hospital and got clonazepam inyected, and i wi will go to see the doctor in a few days. i study psychology and i have had anxiety attacks before, but not like this one. the only thing that keeps me somewhat sane is my family. i am alone at my house until tomorrow my parents are on a business trip .	moderate

the corona virus is making me feel depressed and suicidal am i the only one who is getting depressed suicidal feelings because of the whole corona virus? i am not particularly scared of getting the virus it would suck for sure, but i am not in any risk group of dying from it, so i presume i wi will survive but i am worried about all the precautions we have to do. here in the netherlands, we are not on total lockdown, but the main advice is to stay indoors and avoid physical contact. the bars, cinemas, libraries have closed until at least th april. litlle backstory, i am a really lonely person, i have a few acquaintances but no actual friends romantic relationships. i have a history of mutiple mental health issues and for that reason i am on mental health benefits, so i dont have a job or school. recently i have been getting myself out there more, actively meeting new people, trying to go to new places try new hobbies and hopefully start some new voluntary jobs. but all of this seems to need to be stopped until further notice. if our country goes on full lockdown, our pri ame minister was saying that possibly could be up to a year . so i presume the advice to stay indoors and avoid physical contact could also be applicable for up to a year. i dont know how i am going to survive staying indoors and avoiding physical contact for a year. honestly, i think this is going to make me so depressed that i might ki will myself. does anyone else feel the same way? does anyone have any tips?	moderate

my poetry i have wrote a few poems abour how i feel and i would like to share it so here i just want to die.... i had a great day i am fine you? my friends are really nice! i got great grades is class i wear long sleeves because i easily got cold i am not hungry everyone is nice to me i love sleeping i sleep a lot i never cry that s what i say to the people around me but what i actually mean today was terrible i am not fine i know my friends talk about me behind my back and that they use me. no one cares about my grades i just want to hide my scars i am fat no one cares about me i hate sleeping because of the nightmares i know i wake up the next day i sleep hours at night i cry myself to sleep i cry everyday... all the laughs are fake. the happy smart girl is not the real me it is a mask and no one knows. the troublemaker that is not me either. that is life when no one knows about your feelings, when no one knows about your scars. and i know that it gets better but then it only gets worser and then you do not know what to do. i know i am not the only one but so does it feel like i am alone because in real life no one knows you feel alone. i lie to friends and family every day, but when i put an end to it, they continue after a few months and forget me so it does not matter to me it no longer makes sense i am already too deep in the shit. the voices are getting worse every day and i do not know how long i wi will last. skin, skin, so paper thin red is a beautiful colour sad, sad, she is feeling bad just one more, one more another dread, dread, dripping red am not it sad that in her head she is only happy when she is almost dead empty, empty, always empty the hollow feeling grows a little longer not much more until she finally goes. they never see and they never notice my smile fade or the dead look behind my eyes they do not see how numb i am or how dead i am inside i am too afraid to show them how bad it really gets i am scared they wi will leave they are all i have got and they just can not know.... yes i know you see me laugh and joke you know me as the clown, the happy one the goofy dork one you see me as one who is always joking and smiling i know i look so happy but i am not i am dying inside and you all do not see it it is like you re all blind these three i wrote in class while cutting myself and no one noticed even thought my sleeves were full of blood... and now i am here in the classroom and nobody notice my sad face i wonder if the teachers ever notice that when i turn away my smile fall. i wonder if they notice my dull eyes they never see my smi will fade i know they are not the best but it explains my feelings a little bit.	moderate
i keep catching myself fantasizing about death it is weirdly comforting i amagining different ways i could get out, even though i am probably not going to follow through on any scenario. like i can pretend to have a little control over my fate.	moderate
corona i thought about skipping therapy due to corona but then i dove deeper into why i do not want to go to therapy. digging deeper on why i do not want to visit the therapist or the psychiatrist. i feel like i am just wasting ti ame being in therapy. i feel like a therapist is just someone who follows a book and gives basic advice that you can get anywhere, and if not come up with by yourself. i work too hard for my money to just be giving it away, which is what it feels like someti ames, giving money away. i have family members that help me. i have friends even if it dosent seem like it someti ames. i have people that i can go to. i have a much deeper understanding of things compared to her other clients. someti ames everything seems so obvious to me and that motivation is the only thing that gets in the way. i have not gained much coping ski wills from her, or at least that what it feels like. i feel like antidepressants work just a little bit better than placebos. i feel like if meds really worked no one would be in deep depression. i feel like these meds control me. i do not like the idea of being controlled.	moderate

first post here so i am currently struggling with the loss of my gran who brought me up since the age of five. she took me in after my mum died and she passed on saturday, it is absolutely heart breaking as mother is day, my mums death date and then this happened so close together. i am scared i am not going to be able to bring myself out of the way i am feeling at the moment. depression is something i have suffered with since the age of and i am now . i do not think i wi will ever feel like the same person again.	moderate
when you know your depression is a burden to those around you... i guess i just need to maybe vent or maybe someone has advice? not sure what i am looking for here. i am really struggling with my depression. for whatever reason i fall off the wagon someti ames with my meds and my whole life falls apart. someti ames i lose them, someti ames life gets carried away and i forget..this ti ame i have been so stressed about this corona virus stuff and i have been constantly fighting with my partner. speaking of my partner...i feel like such a pain in the ass every ti ame anything relating to my mental health occurs. i am emotional and destructive mostly self destructive and no one should have to go through that. i really love them and i wish they could be with someone normal. someone that does not want to die all the ti ame. it is starting to wear them down, i can tell. what do you do when you have severe depression and a loved one? how do you just let them go through your mess and not feel even worse and guilty ?	moderate
this quarantine fucked me in so many ways i just feel hopeless, i was only getting up from my bed to see friends of mine in school, and i do not can not handle this shit anymore, i just realized they do not care, they just stay near me because they feel sorry for me being this way, i just do not want to keep moving on, i just want to be someone else, like... why am i like this, just a fucking horrible person that everyone feels sorry, i just want to be truly happy again. i just can not remember the last ti ame i was truly happy, i do not even know why am i sti will alive, maybe i should just end it already...	moderate
does it get any easier!? just looking to hear from anyone that is made it out the other end of depression as i have been struggling excessively recently. for the past give it or take a couple of months i have essentially been miserable. in a permanent state of anxiety, unable to connect with other people, unable to concentrate, articulate my words, have meaningful conversations, make new friends, look after myself properly and i have reached the point where i am just too tired of it to carry on trying. i have watched all my friends move on and achieve things, make new friends, etc. and i feel like i have just been stuck in the same rut i have always been in and always wi will be in. it feels like there is something inherently wrong with my brain. like i do not have the depth of thought that other people have. i can not express myself, and even if i could i do not have any opinions on anything because nothing makes any sense to me anymore. i really do not know what to do, all my free ti ame is spent in bed either obsessing over how empty my brain has become and how i have lost my personality and intelligence or forcing myself to go to sleep. please someone tell me there is an end in sight.	moderate

tips for beating depression hi guys, i have moderate to severe depression since about . in the last years i have found myself ruminating about past trauma and embarrassments non stop. i have tried cbt, albeit only for weeks and have tried citalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine, mirtazapine and qutiapine. the only small success i had with these was with the latter, before my depression just came back harder. does anybody have any suggestions? i am thinking of paying for private cbt sessions, probably over a week period. are there any other medications or ways you can think to beat this? i am a fairly active year old male with a fairly good job and social life. i play football and go to the gym. from the outside i feel many people would think i have got a great life, which makes it even sadder. i feel as if i am getting to the end of my tether with this and i can not i amagine progressing in life and starting a family etc with my current state of mind, very worried. many thanks in advance.	moderate
i hate how people undermine my depression i help my friend with depression for whatever his reasons are and i try to understand and help but whenever i say that i have depression because i felt lonely all my life, no girl loves me and that i am a virgin and never felt inti amacy in my life. people just ignore it and say oh its no big deal or nobody owes you anything . and no shit nobody owes me anything but is that how you comfort someone? its like they undermine my problem and make it non existent. maybe i should start comforting people who have been through breaks ups and say nobody owes you anything, stop being whiny . like why do we gatekeep depression? i have been bullied my whole life and have strict parents, never felt love or inti amacy, been lonely. do i not atleast deserve some support? or does that only apply to people who have gone through break ups and divorces? why do we kick down those who are already down? we all have issues and are depressed for different reasons. depression isnt a one way street.	moderate

waiting to die lately it is really sunk in that i am a loser and as i get older i wi will just be one of those unremarkable people who are alone. throughout most of my life i kept being told my problems were just my age, or just puberty, etcetc and i always thought things would get better or that if they did not i would finally be taken seriously the older i got. but now that i am it is like some switch went off and it went from constantly being thismissed because of my youth and being told things would get better to being treated like i have some sort of incurable and hopeless thisability and that i am irreparably unintelligent and not worth bothering with because i have all the same problems i had when i was . that is the general feeling i get when i try to access therapy but then again i live in a province which although it has socialized mental health care it is a notoriously terrible system with a bad reputation throughout my country . this is a really scary change in the way people treat me and probably has some truth to it. whereas i always used to hold out hope, i truly envision myself being and sti will having these issues and never really doing anything with my life and being miserable for all this ti ame. due to a family history of heart thisease and my current eating habits lifestyle i do not plan on living much past anyway. i refuse to commit suicide as long as i know the terrible i ampact it would have on my mother, but where does that leave me? biding my ti ame, waiting and wanting to die. i feel no joy or excitement from life. i have to work because i do not want to be more of a burden than i already am and that just adds stress and drudgery to an already dull and meaningless existence. it really would be better if i was dead for my mother financially, but unfortunately the emotional i ampact would negate the benefits. if it was not for this i would have already committed suicide long ago. i am a homosexual male and feel absolutely no connection with anything to do with the alphabet people if anything i feel a repulsion towards them, at least how they behave on a mass scale. i feel very bitter about this because i was told when growing up that when i became an adult i would find my tribe as it were and find a group of people that i totally fit in with that was a lie if ever there was one. i do not really fit in anywhere and with them least of all. i have no friendships, no relationships. but i am capable of making friends and putting on a mask and at ti ames can be the life of the party as it were. i am so sick of telling this to therapists and they i ammediately assume that because i have no friends i must not understand social cues or something. they do not seem to understand that one can just truly not enjoy other people. that being said i am terribly lonely and yearn to make a connection but am continuously thisgusted by and thisappointed by other people. i am very ugly and no amount of exercise wi will really i amprove that on top of everything else. i also have an unusually high pitched voice and think i might have some kind of abnormal lack of testosterone. i tend to have severe anxiety and over react to things all the ti ame as if i have some kind of allergic mental reaction to every day things. in general i just feel like a total misfit who was never meant to be alive and who has trouble coping with basic life. i have been on all types of medication for over a decade and none of it works. i try and seek out professional help and am met with therapists who only ever seem to be able to spout out mindfulness as a cure all which is just a pseudo spiritual, i ampersonal, formulaic, platitudinous piece of garbage which seems to have unfortunately come into vogue among mental health practitioners. i do not really know where i was going with this just a long rant i guess. i have given up hope on myself, my ability to help myself, and i have also given up hope on the system to help me. unless if something drastic hopefully happens i see myself living several more years each day waiting to die without ever being in an inti amate relationship or forming meaningful friendships. i force myself to have hobbies and interests but those only go so far, most of the ti ame i try to sleep as much as possible to block out my consciousnesses.	moderate
i hate myself i feel like a piece of shit, it is one thing to get annoyed at other people, or to have life throw you down constantly. those things hurt, but i know i can get through them. but for the first ti ame i realised i genuinely hated myself. i was told by someone in my family that i was argumentative and that i sounded like i was trying to act smart all the ti ame. this hit me like a brick, this was not said as a passing comment or as a part of an isolated incident, this was a dead serious rejection of my character. by family no less. if they were wrong i could have pushed through it, but they were right. i am a piece of shit, maybe not intentionally, but i am. always trying to push forward controversial opinions because i think i know better than society in general, getting annoyed when others tell me to be more respectful, or call me stupid. i just want it all to end now, to just thisappear	moderate
i am such an idiot.. so ti ame is getting harder and harder to deal with and i promised my boyfriend that i would try to get better for hi am. unfortunately with my current living situation with my family, it is causing me to spiral out of control and to get further and further into depression than i already am. now because i know i can not just ki will myself as i know to consequences that my boyfriend the only person who cares for me wi will have to deal with, i have ended up relapsing and turning back to self harm and i just do not know of any way i can deal with the pain better than i currently am although it makes me feel worse knowing i am unintentionally hurting my boyfriend by hurting myself. i just do not know what to turn too anymore before it gets too bad.	moderate
i do not even know what is wrong with me alright so... it is almost midnight, i am sitting in bed after one of my episodes . i am not sure what i am even feeling, but i sure as hell know that i do not want to be here. lately i never know how i feel and honestly that might just be cause i literally lost the ability to care about things. i keep asking myself what is wrong with me and i keep telling my mind that i am just making it up maybe for attention or who knows, but i dont actually know if i believe that. i dont know if theres anything even wrong with me but nothing feels right anymore. i probably dont make a lot of sense, i am sorry for that, but either way... the main issue is that although i dont think i should get help because i am pretty sure people would think i am faking it and since i do not even know if i am or not, i am just clueless. it is just that constant numbness and that loss of feelings that makes me think that i am crazy... anyone else get that?	moderate
i am ki willing myself this evening i do not know why i am posting this here because i am afraid of people telling me that i am selfish when i already know i am or that it gets better when i already know that that is not true. i am in indescribable pain and i commend everybody in this subreddit who can keep going day in and day out while feeling the type of pain that i am feeling, but i am weak and i can not do it anymore. i have tried absolutely everything i could before resorting to this, but now it is ti ame for me to finally help myself for good. i am so sorry.	moderate

back again... after failing my suicide attempt and moving back to the us. i am having a relapse and i wish i did not fail. just how it is in the title. i am back again here on reddit. things are harder and i just feel the loneliness and the depression sinking further in. i want her to have to live with it for the rest of her life. as selfish as that is. she ruined my life, she ruined me, damaged me beyond self recognition. i can not focus, i have no job, no money left. no way to get a car. my friend roommate does not help really. i feel like a burden, nothing but a bunch of bullshit for people to have to handle and i am tired. tired of being told it wi will get better. tired of being told it was the wrong person. tired of being starting my life from scratch. i have too much financial debt here built up, my credit is ruined. my self esteem and my path in life blown up in front of my face. i turn in a few months and i hate who i am as a person. i have nothing but failure, mistakes and a whole lot of fucked up shit i have been through to show for my years on this planet. people told me that it is worth living.. but what is worth living for when all there is going to be is loss, pain, loneliness and suffering. it is all i have known. i realize now what i had and i lost it. and i doubt i have the strength to co to use carrying on. i tried... i am trying... but with each day it gets harder. and i feel myself slowly losing the strength to rebuild from scratch. there is no longer a future i see that i want. i am lost and alone with my own thoughts and no one understands. therapist says to go get help... medication does not work... friends just give the same advice and i am tired. and i want it to be over quick. why do i have to continue to suffer in life so others do not have to be weighed down by a decision i want to make? i want my suffering to end. yet people tell me that i have people who love me. if they loved me, i would feel it wouldn t i? i wouldn t have been thrown aside like i was... i want her to know what it is like to ruin someone is entire life.. and i want my suffering to end. i no longer see any brightness ahead. i am at a crossroads and i wish i took my life that night a few weeks ago. i had a plan. this ti ame... i would not fail. i am tired of suffering. i am tired of living in constant heartache and pain. i am tired of all the loss in my life. i had everything i ever wanted and she threw it away. i feel so worthless. the words echoing in my head. a stark reminder of where i am now. there is no point in continuing the struggle.	moderate
i do not think i want to try to live ...and that is not great mentally. there are many reasons to stay alive, experiencing things, family, friends, allowing myself to continue to grow, etc. it is all right there in front of me. reasons to stay, reasons to be happy, reasons to live on, and hope. except i do not want to try, i am tired. it is such a lame excuse but i am tired of trying for people for myself. i know i am worth it and life is worth it. except i think i am too far gone to actually continue to stay. athough at the same ti ame i am too tired to ki will myself, i do not want more physical pain again i apologize if this breaks rules somehow. just a vent... nothing is worth it for me. it is all so tremendously worth it, but no. just... i am waiting to die and waiting to live. li ambo. either way i could care less i am selfish and sort of fucked in the head	moderate
i have a constant feeling of hopelessness looming over my head i have no hobbies anymore except for reading, because i am able to stop thinking while i read. school was keeping me alive, but now it is all online until at least april th. i feel completely undesirable and lonely. i am so starved for affection and feel thisgusting because i know nobody wi will ever love me again. i have no desire to pursue something that wi will require work because i just do not care anymore. i have two friends but they barely ever talk to me and i just feel hopeless. i feel like there is no reason to be here right now. sorry for the vent	moderate
 m my so called best years are behind me, so what is the point? is there anything else to look forward to? hell, for the last decade i have tried really hard to make up for my lack of reading habits. no matter how hard i try, no matter how many books i cross off my list, classics that i have not read wi will overshadow everything else. what does this have to do with depression? here is the thing as a social outcast, reading and watching movies were the two things that used to keep my depression at bay. my life was not exciting and i sure as shit was not banging the prom queen, but books used to let me pretend otherwise. but my depression is getting worse each day, so i can not even feel secure or knowledgeable about one of the main things that i cared about. tl dr i failed at both making meaningful connections and making the most out of a hobby and i am an empty shell of a man. anyway, take care people.	moderate
 i am always here if you need to talk to me i have always hate it when people say this, i know they are trying to be helpful but the thing i hate so much about is when you actually try to tell them you just get the same response all the ti ame awe that is sad or you ll get there, trust me . the only people am able to talk to about depression are also depressed because they know exactly what is is like to always be in this mind state all the ti ame.	moderate
i give up i am spanish and i am young, i wi will probably have errors, but i hope you read it. i feel that english speaking people understand these issues better, or are more welcoming, at least on the internet. i am writing from my mobile, and it is going to give me a fucking heart attack. it is the third ti ame that i try to write here. my mobile has decided to update just today, and i inadvertently gave it a restart, i knew that would happen so i had saved a part of what i had written. i lost a fairly long chunk, but i calmed down and decided to write it again. now nothing could happen anymore as the reset button was gone. error. my phone has decided to reboot only, and again i have lost everything written. i should write on the computer, given what happened, but i am stubborn. you do not know the rage i am feeling right now, i had written a lot. i was going to let off steam and also tell some things about my life so that you could understand me better, but i give up. this is fucking funny. i do not understand why the hell this happens to me. i can not take it anymore, i am really screwed. many things have happened to me, and they continue to happen to me. every year it has gotten worse, one problem has been added after another, and none has been solved. i have lost count of all the ti ames i have thought about dying. i know that my problems are not going to be solved, i know that i can never forget everything i have been through. i wi will not be able to make up all the lost years, nor change the things that happened. nothing was as i wanted, nothing was as i thought it would be. and i know that my next years are not going to be either, i wi will have to keep holding on and trying harder than the rest. for what? after all i have been through, it is no longer worth, even if in the future i have the best life in the world. it is not what i want. all he wanted was to be happy, but it seems that was too much to ask. i have lowered it to just being calm, to be in peace. but again, i ask too much. i have no reason to continue, and i wi will not live because others want me to. if i live it is because i want to, i wi will not depend on another person. i have tried and tried to exhaustion. i have been holding on all my life. people believe that people with depression or who end their lives do not ask for help. lie. for four years i have been surrounded by people to whom i tell my problems. social services, psychologists, psychiatrists, my tutor, the institute is educational psychologist. four years. if in four years a solution has not been found, it is that there is not. and i do not say it, they say it. his solution is to hold on. they want me to hold on for two more years like this, and then, after two years, i have to continue hold on, and work hard. and for what? i never asked to be born, i did not ask to come into this world, much less suffer all that i have suffered. someti ames there is no solution. all you can do is hold on, but you know what? i am human, and i have a fucking li amit. they want me to live independently of everything i have suffered and i have to continue suffering, is not that more selfish than taking my life? even among the fucked up people, i am the one that is left over, i know from experience. it wi will always be like this, no matter where i go, no matter if they do not know me, it wi will be like this, because i have lived it. i am drowning, i can not breathe. i am exhausted, i can not take it anymore. i have no energy left, no desire, no strength. no one can help me, nor can i solve all my problems. i am sunk, i am pissed off, and i am alone. i have already heard all kinds of messages of support, all kinds of criticism. neither thing works. there comes a point of no return, and i have already reached it. i spend my days sleeping and thistracting myself so as not to think, only for another day to pass. and for what? i know that there are good people, and that there are good things, but they are not worth it. people try not to see reality, because reality is bullshit. it is full of bad people, who screw life to the others. and are we sick? it is easier to convince a person with depression that their thoughts are wrong, that they are wrong because of their i willness, that life is really worth it, that things wi will be solved and that a better future awaits them. that is easier than trying to educate people from a young age, and easier than trying to change bad people. really, i can not take it anymore, i go on the internet and i get sick, reading comments on youtube, or on instagram, or some articles. i get sick, and i can not forget everything i read and everything i see. i know there are people more screwed up than me, who have less than me, who complain less than me, and sti will get ahead, or keep trying. i know. so sorry for wanting to die, sorry for not being able to anymore, sorry for not loving life. i just want to rest. i am sti will able to laugh, or have a good ti ame, but it is not worth it. i really do not know what the hell to do, because i can not take it anymore. and if there is not a solution already, i can not keep waiting. and i know there is not going to be a solution. the pain and anger i feel is excruciating, and all i do is thisappoint everyone. i honestly do not know what i want you to say, because really nothing you say wi will solve my life or how i feel, nor wi will it give me hope of continuing to endure or live. it is my body, and it is my life, and i could not choose to not be born, but at least i should be able to choose when and how to die. my heart really hurts, i feel sore, i do not know if it is because of stress, exhaustion or suffering. the only thing that makes me a little happy is eating mc donald is in my bed while i watch videos, series or movies. but i try not to do it too much because i do not want to get fat, even though that is one of the few things that gives me a little joy. the only reason i have not ki willed myself is because i have to get rid of my things and everything i have on my phone, and that costs me. i know that the police or my parents would touch my things and would not respect my privacy. they would care very much to find out things once i died, when in life all they have done is screw me. i have told my life to many people, professional and non professional, nobody has a solution, or different answers. so i do not know what to expect from this, because letting off steam no longer helps me. i give up.	moderate
i am a burden to everyone because i am depressed again i do not know how to start this. i feel lonely. not because of the social thistancing... in fact maybe it even would be okay if my so was here with me. but here i am, alone without a chance to talk to hi am or see hi am even through a phone screen. he was my support system and he helped me go through the roughest ti ames of depression. and now i am slipping back. i can feel like my soul is escaping the body, it is foreign to me, again. i lost all the colours and happiness i had, i can not sense or taste anything. there is only pain and deep sadness. i am lost and i do not know what to do. i can not even express my feelings to anyone. parents or the only friend are not the people i would open up to and so is not available and i can not put the stress on hi am. i hate myself for being a burden to everyone and eventually my so wi will probably leave me. even i can not stand myself. he would be thisappointed if he would knew that i am depressed again. i do not want hi am to worry about me. i have a therapist but... it is too much to handle... i used to take medicine for depression but i felt even worse. i guess i just needed to write it all out...	moderate

depression come in many forms i have spent someti ame reading other posts on here, i have noticed something missing. at least with what i have found, correct me if i am wrong. i have a very severe depression, i have an addiction to gaming and drinking. as well as a lack of self confidence and hate myself like so much that i have stopped fearing death. now i can talk about this so weirdly calmly cause my couping is not through, hm how to word... i coup through anger. i do not let it out on others i just have a very short temper and beat myself into hell. constantly beating myself down for not being better. i have started seeing the negative in everything and do not see any i amprovement in myself for the future. i dont have goals or meaning in life. i just want to survive long enough to die peacefully hopefully that or go out with my brains on the wall either one. i really want to know if i am not the only one, anyone else coup with anger like me, i feel like everyone around me sees me as some asshole cause i really just tend to thislike everyone and find them all annoying. maybe i wi will get called edgy like i usually do. hopefully none of this was rude in anyway i do not want to hurt anyone, people with depression i love you guys lt i am aware being positive does not really help especially to those far gone but i do not need to be positive i need to here right? well, love you guys i understand your pain, also sorry for my rambling bs	moderate

i do not know what to do this post is just going to be me blabbering away, and i am sorry. i am in my senior year at high school, but i am afraid i would not be able to graduate due to my many days of absence, and not having been able to work much with school, because i have been struggling a lot with depression. since christmas i have been at school maybe a couple of weeks combined. i know i am not stupid, but i feel like such a huge waste of potential. not that i am a genius or anything, but i should at least be able to graduate with decent grades. my entire country have switched to online schools for a few weeks now, and i thought not having to go to school, and being able to work from home would be easier. but it is not. when i log onto the learning platform i am completely overwhelmed and just end up sitting there in my room, feeling horrible. all of my friends know what they are going to do next year, and i do not even know if i am going to graduate this year. i can not i amagine things turning out alright for me, and i can not i amagine a proper future for myself either. i do not know what to do. i feel like my depression is eating away at such a huge part of my life. and i know people say that you are not your i willness , but how can that be true when it affects such a huge and major portion of your life? i have been struggling with depression on and off since i was , and i just do not see it getting any better. i usually do not post, but i just needed to get this off my chest. i am sorry if i sound whiny. i am also sorry if my english is incorrect, it is not my first language. thank you for reading i hope you are all doing well, and if you re not doing well, i hope things wi will get better soon.	moderate

have been spiraling into depression for a couple weeks, now facing isolation. i have been under a lot of stress recently. i have shared this with a couple of my good friends at work i work in behavioral health services . i have been putting off seeing a therapist and getting back on meds prozac . i procrastinated too long. our company made decision to require employees to work from home for the next few weeks. our state is thiscouraging non essential travel and there is a curfew. i live alone. the prospect of no friends or family or work family around....well i had a panic attack driving home and am sitting here crying. i went on fb. all these people thri willed to be at home working or off with their love ones. my last therapist used to tell me not to take ti ame off from work when i felt like this since i have suicidal tendencies. i am really, really afraid of what wi will happen.	moderate
suicidal thoughts i hate it when people call suicide selfish. it is not selfish to want to end your pain. if you want to thisappear people do not get to feel thisappointed. sad, yes. angry, not really. i got backer acted for a suicide plan and all my aunt said to me was i am very thisappointed . i said the hospital helped me but only because i wanted to go home. i sti will cry every night and think i am better off dead. the hospital only scared me. it is like suicide is an issue that needs to be solved but if you do not keep it a secret the police get called.	moderate

i feel like there is no point in being alive anymore. i am so bored and tired all the ti ame. i work nightshift which definitely does not help my depression. i literally work, eat, and sleep. i do not want to do this for the rest of my life. i have a boyfriend who i love, but we have a turbulent relationship. partly due to my depression and other mental i willnesses, and hi am being unable or unwi willing to understand. for example, i am literally never horny and am repulsed by my body, and i try to tell hi am that, but it always ends with hi am being angry at me and turning it around saying you do not make me feel wanted. i am sorry i can not turn you on. i have tried so hard to make hi am understand, but he does not. while we were fighting over this and the fact that i had burned myself and was talking about how i do not want to live anymore , he told me you re just too broken. today my dog bit his friend in the face. my dog is friendly to literally everyone except this one man, who knew my dog did not like hi am, but he decided to get in his face anyway and got bit. he started yelling and saying he would throw my dog against the wall, punch my dog, ki will my dog. i was in shock and did not really apologize well due to the fact i was angry he was talking about ki willing the only thing in life that has kept me living this far. now the guy has filed a police report, and if he ends up going to the doctor for it, i wi will have to pay his medical bi wills. thank god he is not pressing charges, but yeah. my boyfriend is on his side, saying there must be something wrong with my dog. i kept saying what kind of friend is that? and he told me he would do the same thing. he said if the roles were reversed and he got bit he would beat the fuck out of the dog too. i told hi am i wi will fix this by never coming over to his apartment with my dog again. he is going to continue being friends with the guy. my friends do not ever talk to me. we have been friends since high school. i understand we re doing our own things now, trying to grow up. there was a period of ti ame last year my mental health was so bad i could barely leave the house. i had isolated myself and deleted all social media. no one asked me what was wrong. they would just get mad when i said i did not want to go out. i ended up apologizing to them for sinking down into my depression hole, which was met with them telling me yeah, i was pissed at you, but i know how you are and forgiveness. does me being depressed need to be forgiven? i have no motivation to do anything. everything bores me. i wi will start a tv show and drift off thinking or playing on my phone or changing the show. i can not keep interest in any hobbies. i wi will start a project and days later i would not care about it anymore. i had not cut myself in a year. i quit taking my birth control and all hell broke loose in my mind. i did not cut, but i held a knife over a lighter and then burned myself. just to feel something. just to focus on anything. i really feel like life is not worth living. nothing in my life is fun. i do not even have the motivation or want to do anything fun. i just want to sleep and smoke and hate my life. i only have dollars to my name, no savings. i have a car and a place to live rent free, so i am blessed in that aspect. but is it a blessing if i do not even want to live? why do i deserve this? there are so many people who deserve this, and i do not. i deserve to fucking rot in the dirt. i have been thinking about taking my dollars and just driving across the country with my dog. it is not a feasible idea, but it is where my mind likes to escape to when i am not down enough to think about suicide. i guess i think that on my little journey i wi will find something worth living for. i always try to run when things get hard. but by then i wi will have lost my job and run out of money. i get like this so often, but recently it just feels like shit keeps happening to me. i keep getting shit on over and over. i am stuck at dollars , and can not seem to get more than that without something happening and me having to pay. i have been planning on going back to school, but i am not excited. i know i am just going to fail like i have before. i wi will get all these classes and be so ready to learn, and then a month in i wi will say what is the point and flunk out half of them. i truly hate myself. i do not think i can change. i am a horrible, pathetic excuse for a human being and i really must deserve the bad things that happen to me.	moderate
i do not have anything to offer the world, so i just try to stay out of everyone is way. i am a boring person, and thus, i do not have any friends. people have told me to go out more, and not completely isolate myself. but i have never got the point of going out. not like i have anybody to go out with, and being around a bunch people makes me feel on edge anyway. i have spent weeks in my dark room completely alone, never leaving once and it is really no different from when i go out to run errands or get food or whatever. i am miserable and lonely either way, so atleast if i stay in, i can be comfortable. plus, the people i know do not really enjoy my company i am sort of just there , so it works out better for everyone if i just stay in my room, and let the world just go on without me.	moderate
meds finally working i am on mg lexapro and mg lamictal. they just doubled my lexapro a month ago. i went through so much the last years. i am bipolar and trauma is a trigger. crap roommates. one i had to get a restraining order on when he went off his schizophrenia medication and threatened to ki will me. my brother died of brain cancer. i was a pri amary caregiver and lived with hi am in hospice for days. i was the only one there when he died. car accident two weeks after the funeral and off work for months on medical leave. mil died of cancer months after my brother. sti will dollars , in debt catching up. last week the compressor on my refrigerator died due to something a roommate did years ago. my parents gave me that dollars fridge. they never give me anything. and i quit my job. one of the reasons i quit was they accused me of faking my memory problems from my meds. the other was saying, what do you have to be depressed about? they know about my brother and mil. i handled it all gracefully. i did not break and stayed calm. i saw that toxic environment for what it was. my boyfriend supported me and offered to pay to install a new compressor. my mom told me that she is proud of me for knowing my worth. and best of all, i am becoming more of the person i was before my brother got sick. life wi will never be the same but, i am finally living again. there is hope where i was convinced there was none. never give up the fight.	moderate

help me help i have made some progress on my depression over the last couple years, but i have hit something of a stalemate. i recently heard on a podcast that helping others with depression could help me progress. so, i am looking for some mutual benefits from helping someone s who is are having trouble. i would prefer to find people who are in my area since getting out is a big part of curing the thisease, but i am also more than wi willing to chat with folks online. if there are not people here, what are the best ways places to find them? i live in a southwest chicago suburb.	moderate
i do not know what to do anymore and literally just want to die at this point because i do not see any other viable option. i pissed away my high school years doing drugs and not giving a fuck. i spent a year and a half after graduating being on probation for doing some really fucked up stuff that i would not even get into. during that i came out as gay and my friend group went from large to literally people, one of which i really do not even like. i found a boyfriend and we have been dating long thistance for a year and i am honestly just sick of hi am someti ames. he has aspergers and while i understand he might not do it on purpose, he treats me like shit but i can not for the life of me get over my love for hi am or break up with hi am. i finally work up the courage to go back to school, trade school. i can not do a normal college because i wi will fail. too much stress. i hate the trade i am in and only chose some random one so my mom would get off my fucking back about doing something with me life. in reality i have and honestly always have absolutely no ambition or motivation to do anything with my life. so what is the point? why keep doing this only to end up suffering. i finally work up the courage to go to a doctor and he tells me that he does not think i am actually depressed and that it is more just anxiety and he puts me on anxiety meds that i can not even remember to take everyday because i really just do not give two fucks about anything. fuck this. fuck everything. i am done.	moderate
going through a really hard ti ame some background recently went through a separation with my wife. we have a yo. we are both from different states originally and she moved out of state before we officially separated. we own a home together minutes from my parents and she now has an apartment minutes from her parents in the other state. long story short, we are back together but because of our daughter is age the mother is favored by a court so we are now living in her apartment in the other state. i reluctantly agreed to sell our home since it is been sitting vacan not like a ti ame capsule for months since we have been living out of state we are here now going through the process of emptying it out for sale and it brought back so many emotions i am having a really hard ti ame dealing with it. one of the worst things about it is how hurt my parents are by not seeing our daughter. they played a huge role in the first two years of her upbringing. it was one thing i was always proud of showing my parents we raised our daughter well and seeing how much joy she brought to my parent is lives. they are really thistraught about it. i do not know what to do. i feel so lost living away from my family and friends, and torn that they do not get to see our daughter regularly anymore. i have always felt my whole life that i was meant for something great, and now here i am in my mid s with no job, no friends or parents around me, living in a cold rainy city. i do not know what to do. i do not want to lose being in my daughter is life and i love my wife, but i do not feel like she is considering my happiness or joint decision making with our daughter. has anyone on here gone through something si amilar? just curious to get another perspective.	moderate
appearing normal and pretty sucks i really hate sounding like i am bragging, but looking conventionally attractive while deep in a depression really fucking sucks. i have been severely depressed for more than half of my life now, with the severity coming in waves. i was okay a few months ago, but now it is like my medicine is not doing shit. i do not feel like i am taken seriously because you re such a beautiful girl! what the hell could i possibly have to be depressed about?! this is not about my looks. my brain is fucked. do i have to resort to looking haggard to be taken seriously? i get dressed and put on make up because it helps me feel somewhat normal, but inside, i am barely holding it together. i have kids so i have to get up every morning to get them to school. i have my own business that i have to deal with and i am not dealing with that very well right now. i have a boyfriend who loves me, but i do not like telling hi am just how fucking bad i am doing because there is nothing he can do to help. i am not going to ki will myself, because of these people in my life, but damn, i wish i could just not exist. nothing i am doing in my life feels worth this misery.	moderate

depression is this a subreddit to write a long post in about how things have been for the past few years and then how i am feeling these days and what i am trying to do and what that makes me feel? i have been diagnosed for over years now and as a young adult it is been hard to understand and to explain to the people close to me. it was the reason i could not continue my degree and had to move away, but also the reason i was about to live in the same city as my now husband when i moved. it was something that strengthened the relationship i had and led to a deeper shared trust between us than we would have had otherwise in the same amount of ti ame. it inspired so many of my poems, unknowingly, in that ended up being relatable for other people, i guess. but it is sti will keeping me up at night, sti will making me doubt my ability to thrive in the future, sti will taking the wind out of my sails every ti ame i get a happy moment. questions come and i answer them without asking someone else, but i know i am not to be trusted with my own thoughts. could i ever achieve and maintain that baseline that the therapists talk about? am i really doing my best and trying my hardest to fight this daily war in my mind? am i going to end up overweight and bitter and negligent like the other parents i have seen, when i someday have children? how, when, what is the question, and somehow, someday, something must be my reply, even if i do not believe it right now. daily meds, acceptance that i must rely on others to succeed, hope for a better tomorrow, these are my tools right now the arrows in my quiver. please tell me i am not wasting my life.	moderate

i am so exhausted and i am so exhausted for my loved ones. there really needs to just be a button to painlessly exit this world for people who wi will never get better. these bouts of depression just seem to get worse and worse each ti ame. more frequent. i just do not see the point of life. am i really just living to work my shit job to live in my shit apartment for the rest of my life? i have no friends. no romantic interests. it is hard to keep people around when you re depressed, which only makes the loneliness worse. i doubt anyone wi will even read this, as there are so many people on this sub writing this same exact post in different ways and flavors. i hate that i get so down like this. i honestly believe i wi will never make it back. then i get up and can not fathom ever feeling so down. i mean, i remember it but just think i am better . someti ames i realize it is just a fleeting moment and to just enjoy it while it lasts. but i am sick of chasing those short, long awaited moments. i am sick of going through all this gunk. i do not have it in me anymore. i would like to never turn , which gives me about four months. i just hate the thought of doing this to my parents. and brother. and my one best friend who lives far away and is sick of my anger and thisappointment at everything she says. i am sick of it too. are there scenarios where it really seems like an accident? i had one therapist tell me that a lot of suicides attempted suicides are done via car accidents. i wonder what the specifics are. i would want something a bit more certain and less painful, of course. i am sick of going through these deep depression bouts. i am sick of dealing with my painful skin condition. most people are assholes and i do not have the stomach for it anymore. i am just sick of this world.	moderate

i am not selfish warning i do talk about suicide and self harm in this so please if that might trigger you do not read this hi, i am alexa ann first, middle i know nobody knows me, and chances are nobody cares but i just want to say that i am not selfish for wanting to take my life. it does not make me selfish if i do not have a valid reason to die . maybe i am not abused at home, maybe i am not bullied at school or i have lots of friends and i smile so i must be happy, right? i am not poor and there is nothing wrong with my life physically so why do i have the right to feel this way? because maybe i am not bullied or abused, or poor and sure i do have friends. but i stand around my friends and i am alone. i sit alone in my room and mentally abuse my body and my mind. my opinion is poor and i am selfish for harming myself. i lay in the bath under the surface of the water until i see the light darken, i stand with the rope around my neck and i step off the chair, hear my heartbeat pound thru my body but yet i never truly die. i am stuck here. alone, abandonned by myself. isolated because i can not stand high enough to get out of this hole that i have dug for myself, my own grave that i have made so quietly while i have suffered. i am not selfish. i just want to be free of the pain that i have caused myself...	moderate

feeling certain i wi will die alone hey reddit, i almost can not believe i am doing this but it is got to come out somehow. my therapy session today barely scratched the surface, and it is been bugging me for months, actually years. i feel like i am of no desire to people romantically or sexually. when i make comments like this people just say to me shut the up, no you re not. or you re young, you ll find somebody. after just turning , i have literally found only one person who was wi willing to date me. i have heard all the excuses, was not into it, did not think you liked me that way, etc. and i have even been stood up a couple ti ames. honestly it feels like people use me as their fucking therapist, then talk to me about how they are in love with my friends. and i am here crying myself to sleep. do not get me wrong, i am not taking the whole incel route to things. i do not feel like anybody owes me anything, i just kind of feel like i am not worth anyone is ti ame. i am a scientist, and i take data in and make conclusions. so many failed attempts indicate a relationship between myself, and lack of interest from other people. i used to think it was because i was fat. i lost pounds, and while i am sti will overweight, i am no longer obese. then i thought it was because i can not see well enough to drive. and i know gender roles do not matter and all that, but even in support groups, i see women happily married with the same condition as me, but all of the men are left longing. now i am thinking it is an unfortunate cocktail of all of these things, and my declining mental health. i am going to regular therapy, i am working out, i am meditating, i am journaling, but it all seems to just take the edge off but i am sti will left apathetic, cynical and sad. anyone have si amilar experiences? words if encouragement? maybe just misery loving company? idk	moderate
i hate being alone, and i do not know how to not be alone, and i feel like i have no purpose. no throwaway because fuck it, why would i care. i hate being alone. i hate feeling unwanted, and knowing everybody else just seems to be able to get out and do the thing . i am in my mid s, and i feel like from here i am just going to somehow be less attractive than i already am. i did everything everyone told me, i lost lbs and got in the best shape of my life. i have gained back some of it since i stopped having the motivation to go to the gym anymore about years ago. at least i sti will look a lot better than i did i guess. i learned how to dress, and even developed my own style, started in retail, and have been a retail manager stylist for years now. i love the business end of it but it pretty much ends there. i did everything everyone said to make myself better, from what people have told me i am not an unattractive guy, but it does not matter. i am barely five and a half feet tall anyways which as a guy just makes me worthless anyways. i just feel like society is some crazy puzzle that i wi will never fit in with or understand. i do not really go out because i do not know how. i do not drink, i do not smoke, i do not know how to relate to people at all or enjoy the things that people my age seem to enjoy. my friend got me back into a hobby i enjoy, and i have met a few people and gotten out more because of that, but someti ames it just makes things worse. when people are better than me at something it makes me angry. i hate that i feel like i am only good for working and for that thing. i am not useful as a human being, that thing is all i have. when someone, especially who seems attractive and well adjusted is better than me, i just feel like i am useless at the one thing that i actually had. i wi will start practicing for hours a week when i lose because i can not fathom the thought of losing, and what is worse is for all the work i have done in the grand scheme i am not even that good. i hate that when someone else beats me at anything they get to have friends or a significan not other that they get to go home to. they have somebody to be happy with. when they have a bad day they get to go home and tell someone about it, and feel consoled even if things are bad. i do not get that. i do not get much of anything, and even if i did...... i do not know how to not be alone. i live by myself, i have become a pretty good cook, but i only know how to cook for one person. i cooked dinner for my parents, and made for for a thanksgiving, and even though everybody said it was good, i know i can do better and none of it was as good as i am capable of. i have a really difficult ti ame sharing my space. i am so used to my things being mine and having me to myself that i feel like i can get upset when i have to feel like someone else is being a part of what should be mine. i feel like i wi will never find romantic happiness because whenever it even seems like a possibility i just push the idea away first of all because i do not feel like anybody could love me so why even get my hopes up or try, and second because everybody seems to know what they are doing and i do not even know what i would do if i weren t alone. i do not know how to co exist with another person in my life. to make it worse, i have no idea what to even do to seem like i am even a remotely interesting person. every ti ame i read an article or someone wants to help me, i just get this long list of things that women expect. you have to be flirty but not too flirty or you ll seem needy. the first date has to be nice but not too nice or you ll seem needy, but god forbid you invite her to starbucks or something because obviously that means you re boring. how the fuck am i supposed to know what to do. why does all of this have to be so fucking complicated? even if i were hugh fucking jackman i would probably sti will lose out to all the guys that have all this shit figured out. everybody wants to go out drinking and have fun and not only are most things people enjoy not fun to me, the things that someti ames make me a little bit happy can very quickly also just make me sad or become something i can not enjoy. i have been alone basically my entire life. i had one girlfriend when i was years old that broke up with me after a month. i do not understand the world, i do not even understand how to be happy with myself.	moderate

what is wrong with me things are going great for me. i am an year old college student living with my loving and supportive family. i do not have a job and i enjoy not having one quit a little over a month ago . recently, i even got my first girlfriend, which i think is going well. i have plenty of friends, despite not really talking to them much anymore, so what the fuck is wrong with me. i feel sad most of the ti ame, angry some of the ti ame, and with small spurts of happiness sprinkled in between. it is like the joy is sucked out of me and i am left empty. whenever someone even jokingly says something hurtful, i think about it for days afterward. i do not understand what is wrong with me. there is no sob story. i am a privileged middle class white male with no terrible backstory. a great childhood now that i think about it. i should not feel like this but i do. all i have been thinking about is how useless i am to everyone. tiny insignifican not speck among bi willion others just like me. i am nothing to anyone. i convinced myself everyone hates me and only just barely puts up with my shit. they say they care but all i think of is that they are lying to themselves and me so i do not ki will myself or something. my girlfriend sends me cute wholesome memes and pics and i heart react and stuff, but the truth is i feel nothing. it just does not make sense. i feel so confused and broken. like a lot of others on this sub i just want to stop existing. things look good for a few days or a week, and then i fall back into this. i thought maybe it was loneliness but like i said i have a gf now. on my way home from her house, i felt nothing but sadness after a relatively good ti ame. this is probably just an i ambalance of chemicals in my brain but it sti will does not make sense.	moderate
i do not think alot of people understand how hard it is to keep on trying, especially when the easiest thing to do is give up. i have the wi will do give up tommorow or even today, nothing is really stopping me at this point, except for my family and friends. i am not staying alive for me, i am doing this for them. i hope they understand.	moderate
i intentionally make myself sad to feel better i used to have depression and anxiety a few years ago. even though i recovered, i am prone to getting into depressive episodes because of stupid shit like sad songs or sad movies. whenever this happens, i get this heavy, almost numbing feeling in my chest and is too overwhelming and makes me feel nothing at once, like i want to scream as loud as i can but i also want to stay in bed and sleep. whenever i get this feeling, i intentionally listen to sad songs or watch a sad film to let the heaviness be powerful enough to make me cry hard. i cry and cry, and it makes me feel better at the end because better out than in . is this ok though? i feel like i should try to be in control of my emotions and not let all of these feelings get the hest of me like they did back when i had depression. am i the only one who does this? does anyone else handle their pain like this too?	moderate

it pisses me off how much depression is treated like a joke. some people i used to know would joke about it and pretend to cut themselves with their fingers just because it is funny. what is not funny is the tens of thousands of lives that are taken by depressed people. it is not something to joke about, brag about, or show off to other people. as someone who has had several thoughts of suicide and almost attempted, i do not find it funny when someone jokes about being depressed. if they were actually depressed, they wouldn t go running around to all their little bitch friends saying they are severely depressed. one guy made me so fucking angry with his jokes about cutting that i walked over to hi am and showed hi am all my scars, one by one. he did not find it so funny when i told hi am all the things i think about and what i do to myself. i do not get why people think it is so funny to joke about this kinda thing. it is not funny, it is a very serious matter that affects many families lives in a devastating way.	moderate

the worst part... ...is that these feelings are genuinely the consequence of my own actions. i got myself here, and this is my punishment. all of the crippling shame, the anxiety, the regrets, all of it is because i made dumb fucking decisions. they say that depression is a chemical i ambalance in the brain. maybe that is true for some but not for me. i got myself here through my own choices. the worst part is this realization just makes me feel even more worthless knowing that i could have avoided the path that lead me here. but then i think even deeper. no matter the circumstances, i would have made shitty decisions, because my decisions are the result of my own shitty character.	moderate

how to not feel nothing? i grew up rural in an isolated environment. i was home educated, never really saw other kids growing up, small town. was sad a lot, watching tv with people playing made me sad. somehow got through it. followed the rules got a job make enough to live. but that is all i have. never had a friend or a relationship. i think i should be happy but i just dont feel anything. not good or bad. i just exist. someti ames i try to think of sad stuff to see if i can cry, but i can not seem to bring myself to it. everyone around me thinks i am just fine. so i keep being fine. i know how to i amprove but i do not. someti ames i wi will sleep through the entire day. no reason to get up. someti ames i buy things online and i look forward to it. someti ames i buy things for random strangers, i do not know why. they thank me and go on with their day. i should not do it but i do. i am a decent employee. but when i finish i am reminded of my situation. it feels wrong to write this. there are people out there that have it much worse and handle it in stride. who am i to complain? i do not want to burden or worry anyone, i wi will be fine, just here existing. i hope to maybe one day feel something. i thought maybe writing this post would do that, but it did not.	moderate
having a mental breakdown over this virus. please help me calm down i am feeling severely suicidal and hopeless right now. it is not even the virus. it is all of the quarantining and social isolation going on. stores and restaurants closing up. i have not been working for a few months ago but i know that when i do work, it is a great thistraction for me and interacting with my coworkers and other people really helps lighten the blow of my depression. i was looking around for another job and applying and all that but now it just seems hopeless, especially when people are being made to work from home. i am the type of person that needs social interaction, and lots of it, to keep my depression in check. when i have no one to hang out with, i would go chi will at a coffee shop and now i can not even do that. right now i am spiraling and freaking out, i have had full blown panic attacks today and i sti will feel like i can not breathe. i feel uncomfortably jittery and on edge and i do not know if it is the anxiety. i am feeling so damn low right now i do not know what to do with myself, i can not keep crying for hours. if i am not crying, i am sleeping for hours because i am so drained and have no motivation to do anything. my therapist canceled all of our sessions due to the virus and is only offering online sessions which my insurance does not cover. i can not even see my fucking therapist, the one person i thought i could count on. i am crying right now and hyperventilating. i feel like i am having a mental nervous breakdown. i do not feel well at all and i have never wanted to ki will myself this much before to end the pain.	moderate

i do not know anymore this is all over the place, quite long and probably does not make sense. i am just writing down my thoughts and i wi will most likely delete later. i do not see the point in life, have not seen it in years. growing up, i was always asked if i was depressed by my peers and those considered friends. i would just answer saying i do not know. i remember there were weeks were i wouldn t shower at all until my parents reminded me to. i did not care for my appearance or hygiene. i was just tired and numb. i did not understand people is emotions, i did not understand why i was perceived as rude, and i just si amply did not care. it was not until i met my friends, did i slowly began to actually feel something. i can not understand a majority of my emotions when i do feel them but being with my friends help. i am just si amply in the background, never doing anything for myself, and just si amply going on with the flow of life. waking up, going to school, pretending everything is fine, and then going home only to do homework, go to sleep, and repeat. i say i am fine when my friends get concerned but i do not see an ounce of truth in those words of mine, i do not know if i really am ok. i often have thoughts about ki willing myself, how i could, and the most painless to the most painful ways. however, i never go through with it because i sti will have my friends and i am afraid of the pain. i think i have been getting better, i have been keeping up with personal hygiene and appearance. i have been making an effort to socialize with my friends. however, that nagging feeling is sti will lingering. i am just there, nothing of i amportance, a third wheel of sorts. i just want to sleep and not wake up again. a si ample and painless way to go but, i wi will never go through with these thoughts for i sti will have my friends who i know care even when i think they do not i am grateful for them and everything they have done. i have never self harmed in any way, it is just these thoughts and the feeling of numbness. along with the occasional panic attack. i am a coward, a hypocrite, and a loser. i listen to other people is problems and try to help them to the best of my ability. i offer to listen and help, although i am a bundle of problems myself. i hide and i hide, hiding my problems even when help is offered, i say i am fine when asked, and i ignore all who try to help. the teachers never cared, no one cared. maybe i am depressed who knows. this is all over the place but oh well. i often forget to eat or drink water as well, which might be a concern i suppose. i have difficulty reading now, as in i have a hard ti ame trying to concentrate. ever since i was young, my memory has been bad and i have been wondering if it is a result of me being possibly depressed or just si amply bad memory. i often write things like this down and then delete it. it helps someti ames but not all the ti ame. my doctor wants me to go to therapy due to my panic attacks, they do not know about these thoughts though. as much as i possibly need therapy i do not want to go because i do not want it to all to be a waste of money and i do not want to be a burden to my parents. i feel like i would just lie and lie like i always do. i do not want to be a burden to my friends and family, so i do not go through with these thoughts. i do not want to hurt them even when i am tired and numb. i just want to stop feeling like this and sleep. there is only one person in my friend group, who i have opened up to the most. we have the type of relationship where anything said would not be judged and we just talk about anything that comes to mind. i do not tell hi am about these thoughts seeing as i do not want to burden hi am, he is already stressed as is. even though i know he would understand my thoughts, i do not want to burden hi am nor the rest of our friends so i wi will bottle it all up like i always do and pretend it is all fine. i know i am a hypocrite and a coward, but as long as they are happy and do not know about these thoughts i wi will be fine, it wi will be fine. i am indecisive as hell, been that way since i was a kid. i am always thinking about how people wi will act and think about my response if i say the wrong thing and when i actually say or do what i want to i often got backlash for it. people would say i was rude and among other things due to it. i always feel like i am going to cry if i feel like i am being yelled at even when it is not directed towards me or when being confronted about something that just makes me feel worse about it. going to delete this later.	moderate

i am fucking done with myself. i hate myself. that is it. last night i was chatting with a friend, we were talking about how we hate our bodies and then we switched the topic to try and find something we like about ourselves. she said her thighs. i sat there for a solid minutes and said, i honestly can not find anything i like about myself. this is going to be some ramble vent shit so buckle up motherfuckers. i hate literally everything about me. the way i come off to people and how i am so fucking rude. i do not take care of myself and then wonder why no one has feelings for me. i expect everything to be done for me. i am stuck in such a bad mindset and i can not fucking get out of it. i have contemplated suicide. i have cut. one ti ame i was home alone and grabbed my mom is cutting knife and held it up to my neck or somewhere i can not remember. hotlines are honestly so shitty. this is from my experience so if you re struggling please call them it is not my place to say whether or not you should get help from a certain place. when i came out as bi to my mom she made everything awkward. she told people in my family i did not want knowing. i told her i was straight a couple weeks after. in that ti ame period she asked why i suddenly liked boys and girls. the real reason was because i stumbled upon gay porn. i never told her. i just said, i dunno, i just did. she always was like well what do you mean? so yeah. but i am sti will bi tho. i have randomly laid in bed and cried. i have written a lot of these rant vent things and it does not help. mostly because i over exaggerate and lie. its such a bad habit. i lie and dramatize things for attention and i fucking hate it. i hate myself and want to die. the world is better of without me. my friends are the weird kids at school while i am sti will trying to be friends with them and stay with my other clique of friends that are somewhat normal. my best friend since second grade is like my personal therapist so i wi will be sending this to her probably. hi halle! i should also add i am very jealous and rude and attention grabbing for no good fucking reason. it is a bad habit that i have been needing to get rid of. i have been desperate for a relationship and i have been friend zoned each and every single ti ame. i should not be here. there was a mistake up there. i am in such a bad mindset and i am afraid if i even speak a lick of this to my mom she wi will take me to a actual therapist and then it wi will all get worse from there. i do not care about my appearance and i honestly should. or my hygiene. it is bad. i have been thinking about what i should leave behind. a note? a recording? this? i love my friends and family but they wi will forget when i am gone. they wi will all move on. i am in a badplace. it has not left or changed. i pretend to smile. i do not know what to do. how to cope. i am probably going to cut again tonight. thanks for reading.	moderate

i feel guilty for being depressed i feel guilty for being depressed. i feel like i should have it good and yet for some reason i sti will can not get over this overwhelming, all consuming feeling. i have a decent home life, a job, hobbies, and friends. yet when i am alone at night with my thoughts, i want nothing more than to end it. i feel like all i am doing is thistracting myself with meaningless shit and then it takes over again. i thought i was over feeling this way and tonight it hit me again. it is never a feeling of wanting to commit suicide. it is always a feeling of, i do not want to exist anymore . and i can not stop feeling this way. i try to ignore it by obsessing over one hobby then the next and it is never enough. somedays i feel like no one would really care or miss me. i know that is not true intuitively but emotionally i can not get past it. it feels like my mind is broken and wants to work against me no matter what. i just want the pain to stop.	moderate
i am getting negative thoughts without me thinking about them. i did not know depression was this intense. i can not make the negative thoughts go away even if i am doing something that is thistracting like writing out this sentence. i am getting negative thoughts and feelings without thinking about them, they just appear in my head and would not go away. if i thistract myself enough my brain wi will shun out the inner dialogue of negative thoughts, but i sti will get the negative feelings such as guilt and shame. there is not really anything to feel guilty or shameful about, well, somewhat but my depression exaggerates it and it makes me feel even worse. it is difficult sleeping at night someti ames because those thoughts appear.	moderate
what is the point of sti will living? why have not i ki willed myself already? is anybody going to read this post anyway? so many questions, yeah. i think it would be good to answer them in the order in which they are written. to introduce myself. hi, my name is anne and i kinda do like blueberries but that is not the point of this post, so let us get straight to the point. what is the point of sti will living see, i told you we would get to the point ? many people i know have their future already planned. which is the best thing that could happen to a person really. you just want to know where you re going in life. what you want to achieve. which job you would like to do one day. like, everyone of my friends has seemed to know these kinds of stuff for such a long ti ame that it is kinda making me even more depressed. you see, i am not anymore. i am turning this summer. this fact is totally crazy cause i am just way too old for someone that has been wishing to ki will herself for such a long ti ame lol. which brings me to the second question why have not i ki willed myself already? great question, really. the thought of ki willing myself has been in my mind for quite a while actually. ever since i got bullied during the elementary schoo, i wouldn t make a day without thinking how liberating and relieving that act would had been. my life was so shitty at that ti ame that the thought of ki willing myself one day to end the suffering became the only solution that felt right. this whole situation became so bad that i started seeing a therapist. which, at this point, i am quite thankful for cause if it had not been for hi am and the pi wills he had prescribed to me, i wouldn t have even made it to the end of high school. i was sooo determined to ki will myself really, the suffering was just unbearable. yet, i did not do it in the end. but we re about to get to that later. and, i mean, i am the one to blame partly. i have a really unstable personality and it surely is really hard to love me or be my friend. i generally am really kind to people and let them do any bad thing to me if that means they wi will sti will be by my side. it is terrible doing so, i am quite aware of that. but i am often feeling really lonely because of my shyness and social anxiety, so when i start trusting someone, i really am afraid of losing them cause i know i am not going to replace them that easily. like i said, i am hard to love. i do not think i am worth anything to be honest, so i am always really surprised when anyone actually approaches me and seems to like me. my therapist would have been so upset if he heard me say stuff like that but that is just how it is. i stopped seeing hi am quite a while ago when i thought i am over all this and do not need hi am anymore btw. but i guess that i was wrong. one day, i feel amazing and really happy about my life just to get all depressed and sad the other day or even the same day, only a couple of hours later lol . i just let myself be hurt by people. over and over again. cause it is my fault. on one hand, i know it is wrong but i just continue letting them do that. i just let my boyfriend treat me like shit someti ames. cause it is my fault. plus, who else is going to love me if he leaves me, right? i just have to endure that. it hurts. but you want to know what hurts even more? the fact that i can do nothing about it. i am too scared to be lonely. some days, i feel like my boyfriend genuinely loves me and cares about me and everything in my life is great. other days, i just feel like shit, starting to think that ki willing myself is not that bad of an option after all. it is a great option indeed, yet there is a tiny little problem. i am way too scared to do that. if only i had no self preservation instinct. that shit always stands in my way. it always felt so right to ki will myself but my self preservation instinct always stood in my way. i am just way too weak. so here i am. with no future ahead, having to be quarantined because of the corona virus pandemic, which makes my depression ten ti ames worse. i do not know how long it is going to take before i can at least leave my house, but one thing is for sure. i feel like there is no future for me and i see dying soon as the only option again. but i am scared to do that. again. i am pretty sure that i am going to feel better tomorrow and this would not be that much of a problem anymore, but that is what scares me even more. thoughts like this are always going to be somewhere in my head just waiting to fire their shot this expression is probably not used right, but that does not matter cause my whole life is trash . and i am just too scared of the next ti ame they wi will come to haunt me. my life is a fucking rollercoaster and i do not find it funny anymore. is anybody going to read this post anyway? excelent question , thanks for asking. i do not know. but i feel better having written this down. i do not know why lol. but i just do. so thank you, reddit. if you did read it ti will the end though, please do not judge me. i have done that to myself way too much already. i am going to cry myself to sleep. to wake up feeling quite fine. thinking i could handle my life and feel happy again, only to experience the same thing a few days later. over and over again. ti will the day i die.	moderate
so i am i the only one that feels emptiness when there love around me i think is just my own mind but i feel that every one that says they care really do not, the people that say they love really just find me annoying. maybe i really am nobody like i am but i live in a shelter i am homeless basically but i wi will never find anything that wi will fi will my emptiness. i play games to try and thistract me but when something negative come in my head i am just sad. i just hope my next life is not this horrible.	moderate
i forgot what silence felt like i wish i had not forgotten. for the past few years it felt like my life was stuck on turbo. flying through hours and days. i did not realize i had not caught my breath in some ti ame. i was so busy trying to keep myself thistracted. i could not sit and do nothing for any amount of ti ame, i was so afraid my brain would get too loud. but my mind is constantly loud that it overwhelms me and i tend to forget to do the things that were just in my head. i someti ames forget sentences in mid conversation. i have been running for so long i was terrified to slow down. i tried to talk to friends as often as i could for as long as i could everyday. i would thistract myself with video games and feel a pang of fear when there was not a game i could lose myself in. even playing games i would have twitch up on my laptop just because i could not handle being alone. i did not want the silence. if i read books i had to have the audio book version going at the same ti ame. even watching movies or tv shows i would find myself on my phone because i could not handle sitting sti will. i did not realize it was this bad. after i quit smoking i did not have a reason to sit in silence and just enjoy the sti willness and just let myself sort my thoughts with no thistractions. quitting smoking only made my anxiety skyrocket which in turn threw me into a depression that is so bad i fear being alone in my own head. and i did not realize this until i sat in silence with only the sound of light rain outside. the serenity of calm silence stopped the storm in my mind that was so viciously clouding my judgement. i have lived with depression my entire life, i have seen it take on many different forms. but i have never had it mask itself so well behind my anxieties that it was eating me alive. i was so afraid of the silence, but now it is the only thing bringing me comfort on this lonely night. i thought my mind would never stop racing, i was wrong.	moderate
 yr report the last yrs of my life have been so hard and for the most part sti will are. in that amount of ti ame i lost my way of life handyman electriction my girl friend of yrs got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and of course major depressive thisorder. i work a lonely shit job because of my ms. and depression. its hard to hold down a normal job when your either crying uncontrollably, or in such pain doing regular tasks become incredibly hard. and of course there is the heartbreak to add to all of this she left me because of my ms and depression. it makes me feel unloveable to this day i mean who would want to invest ti ame in sonething they know wi will only break. i am just damaged goods and lastly there is the loneliness because of my shit job i dont really talk or meet people. my friends all have their own lives and i am to poor and shy to go to a bar bymyself. everything just seems to pile up on me. i have battled with cutting myself to thoughts of scuicide. i have and sti will do find myself crying most days but i think that is the loneliness. and i am tired all the ti ame its so hard to do si ample things. people keep telling me its gunna get better but honestly i think it just doesnt get any harder. i have hit rock bottom and my life is a joke and i dont know what to do anymore. i exist one day at a ti ame and hope for the best. i am usually thisapointed as i will find some reason to break down and cry. i have nothing to offer anyone so why bother meeting someone. i couldnt afford to go on a date anymore so why bother with that. most of the ti ame i just keep asking myself why do i matter. and honestly i am just more of a burden to everyone around me that i can not see why i do matter. yrs ago my life was so much better it had its rough spots but everything was fixable. now nothing seems like it can be fixed. my ms is not responding to my meds. i am alone. i can not hold down a job i have crippling depression i have no money i have no one to spend ti ame with i have nothing to be proud of i have nothing that interests me anymore i take no joy from any activity and if i was to say how am i doing. i exist and that is about all.	moderate

lowest point of my life i am at the lowest point of my life. no car, no job, no friends, no money. despite having a tough life, in a lot of ways my parent hindered me from becoming an independent adult by sheltering me. now, i am and trying to make it on my own. i tried to make it on my own in california and could not do it despite working two full ti ame jobs while living in a van. too expensive. so then i moved in with this guy in bumfuck arizona and i can not find work out here. all the guy does is spend his money on drugs gambling. there is really no point even living there because all i am doing is sleeping on the guy is floor. i could leave, but then i wi will just be homeless in some other city going through hell to survive. people say they wi will help you but really would not do shit. people said they were going to help me get work, get a car, etc but it is always lies. nobody wi will help me. i have to help myself but in this situation that is like telling a person with no legs to just walk. you re having to do everything by yourself from rock bottom. it is especially crushing when i worked two full ti ame jobs in california for a month and sti will could not afford a decent car. currently, sti will walking to the point where my feet are covered in blisters. people say life is beautiful, life is a gift, etc. that may be true if you have good moments to counteract the bad moments but what if your life is mostly bad moments? my life has mostly been pain suffering with very few good moments so it is hard to see the truth in that. i keep going. do not really know why i keep going when it is just constant pain struggle but i do for whatever reason.	moderate

i just need to write this somewhere i feel mentally trapped and i am stuck in this place of life not progressing. i need a job, i need to learn to drive and i need to do my college work so i can go to university this september but i just do not want to and the reasoning for it is that i do not want to exist. i just want to phase out and not exist to anyone or anything. i can physically feel all the pressure in my head, it feels full and confused and i can not concentrate on anything i feel numb to all emotion. all i have done for the past months is sleep because that is the only ti ame my mind can be at peace, that and i physically can not help but sleep for someti ames hours a day, my state of mind is actually exhausting me. i do want to be great, i do want to be better i just dont have the motivation because i feel i am worth nothing to people and i just want to hide away. i do not have people who i can call friends, only those i go to college with but once that is over i am on my own again. i would have friends from school but i can not maintain friendships, no one sticks around for me and i can not say i blame them. i do care for people and i want more friends but i have been stuck in this mindset of not wanting to exist for so long that i have pushed everyone away because i want to be alone but at the same ti ame i am crippling in loneliness. i am constantly at war with myself. the things i want, i am somehow fighting against. it is never going to be easy in life i get that but why can not i just be normal.	moderate

besides going to the doctor how do you know if your depressed ? how do you know if your normal is someone else is normal ? does alcohol make anyone unusually happy ? i am starting to wonder if i am depressed , or maybe i am just lazy. i have pretty low self esteem there are some days that are better but it is never great. i rather stay in bed most days and i have gained a ton of weight. my eating habits are garbage i stick to eating very mini amal eating but always choose foods that are shitty. i feel like a terrible person most ti ames. i fantasize about suicide whenever i have a small problem. i also crave validation. is this normal ? i am not sure. i wonder if everyone feels this way. are you supposed to feel happy everyday ? what am i supposed to feel normally ? i am so much happier when i drink and it helps me fall asleep but i do not want to become dependent. anyti ame i feel happy there is always an ulti amatum like i feel like it would not last or it is not supposed to be that way.	moderate
i refuse what life has for me. i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember. i was under the age of , first ti ame i attempted to ki will myself and growing up, i always felt that it is just how i wi will go. it was fate , i told myself. fumbling through life, allowing depression to own and beat me. i was a slave to it, and i sti will am. but i am hoping, i would not anymore. i was planning to ki will myself this june, but plans have changed. i had hope that someone, would see me as i saw them. but the truth is, it is not mean t to be. it can not be. so, i am left with reality, i wi will live long enough to bury both my mother and my brother, like my mother did with her own. and i wi will suffer it alone, like her. my hope that my light would see me the same, has fled. and i know now that there is nothing but suffering left for me. so, i am refusing it. within the month, i hope to be gone. finally free from this cycle, finally liberated from this life. i should not have been woken from my nonexistence the depression won, it is over. i am a coward, and i wi will not suffer the loss of those i love alone. i wi will not.	moderate
depression or unhappy in the relationship? i have been with my girlfriend for years. every now and again when my depression gets bad i do not feel anything for anything including her, i literally just feel like i could throw it all away, everything in my life. usually i get past it and we re good and i love her a lot again. my depression has hit hard again and i do not feel anything, i feel quite suicidal. we bicker over the tiniest things i do not know if the relationship is done or it is my depression? it is so hard	moderate
is this rock bottom? today, i woke up with a crushing weight on my chest. a lot of things are swirling around in my head since the covid outbreak. i live in south korea, so i have been dealing with self quarantine, the panic buying of masks, and all of the paranoia associated with the way the outbreak came out here. on top of this, my long thistance boyfriend that is living back home in the states, has been busy, thistant, and preparing for the covid outbreak back home. i have not truly talked to hi am for days, and it is been painful to work through the loneliness and the possibility that this stress from everything and the stress from lack of communication wi will end us. we have been long thistance for over a year, and overcome so many obstacles, but this really could be the last straw. as i laid their thinking about all of this, i felt my brain wander off to what is even the point of trying to live, be alive, and keep living? everyone is panicking, my most cherished person is thistant and not responsive, i am alone in a foreign country, and work has been unstable for a while due to the outbreak here. it would be easy to thisappear. i then started to wander off into the planning stages of my thisappearing act. i have two dogs, and i picked out people that i know would love them and be better owners to them than i am. my anxiety kicked in, started screaming thank goodness for it , and i knew i needed to call for help. i am scared. suicidal ideations are terrifying. i am terrified. i do not know how to control and i do not know how to step away from them. i spiral so easily when i am not using my brain actively. i guess, i just needed a place to anonymously write down that i am afraid of myself. how calmly i start planning my thisappearance until my anxiety recognizes this is a threat to my safety.	moderate

everyday i lose more and more hope for my future all i want to do is to get high. it is already at that point where i do not care of becoming addicted, because drugs are the only thing that makes me feel pleasure. do not get me wrong, i feel pleasure in everyday life too, but there is much more pain. i have happiness for like seconds and than it fades away. i am getting tired of this. i want to be happy but what is happiness? just look at the society and the people around.. nowhere feels like home to me and that makes me depressed. the world and the society is just so sad and hopeless.. i do not want to live a life of a person who works everyday his job, just to survive. i want to live, i want to do things, i want to experience things. i have got depression for almost a year now started smoking weed a half year ago and it feels like i do not fit in this world. everything is wrong about the world the people, the society, what is considered right and wrong, the government and the list goes on. i remember when i had slight depression, but the problem is, is whenever i try to be happy again it just get is worse and i get thisappointed from the world. my childhood was like that too. i just get more and more thisappointment the more i live. i got no reasons to live but for the drugs. but maybe one day i could be happy without them even though it seems i ampossible to me ? i kinda feel happy rn, because my school is closed and i can spend more ti ame with friends, alcohol, weed, mushrooms and all of that stuff. but if i look at my future and i am only , it seems like i do not have one.	moderate

feeling down about life never being the same hi everyone, not sure if it was right to post this here, i think i am only doing so so that i can write down my thoughts. i am a really fortunate person, i am married to a wonderful wife, i have two beautiful daughters, i finished studying last year, have a grad job and am getting a new house built later this year. but... i have struggles with depression for the last couple of years, i tried going to a doctor, i wanted to start antidepressants before seeing a psychologist but he did not agree, so i guess i stopped seeing hi am. what is really gotten me down lately is just thinking about being a teenager, the really good ti ames i had with close friends, the movie nights, hanging out after school, playing music together. as i have gotten older year old i have drifted apart from everyone, i see them from ti ame to ti ame but nothing like i used to. i feel awful for not fully enjoying the life i have with my wife and kids. i go through phases of suicidal ideation, i have called lifeline a couple of ti ames in secret, i would never act on them but i sucks feeling that way. i just feel like running away, i keep making arguments with my wife accidentally because of my bad moods. i do not know how to feel better.	moderate

i am such a horrible person... i am sorry if it is going to be long, but i really need some advice right now. i am a girl, years old, it is my last year in high school. i suffer from depression, anxiety and extremely low self esteem, that is probably because of my narcissistic parents. i am the middle child, i have two sisters. i am neither the oldest and smartest, nor the youngest and cutest. i am just nobody. but apparently i am exceptionally talented in math and physics. let me explain. when i started high school years ago, i had absolutely no i idea who i was. after many years of denying and desperately trying to forget the nights i cried myself to sleep feeling like an orphan. i felt guilty for feeling like that, because i had food, clothes and a roof over my head. my siblings hated me as well, they were always jealous of me. two years ago i had a severe eating thisorder, and all i received from my family was even more hatred. i do not think i need to explain the horrible effects of narcissistic parents on a child. but they did love my sisters, for a reason that was unclear to me. so i needed to find it out, in order to change myself. you probably guessed that nothing really worked. i must have been so bad, i did not even deserve to be loved. i felt like i was worthless. honestly i sti will feel like that. my physics teacher was the first one to tell me otherwise. he said i was talented. he said if i wi will ever have a daughter, i want her to be like you. . i just could not handle that. if i was so good, why did not my own father want me? it confused me. i constantly felt like an i ampostor, i was afraid that if he would get to know me better, he would find out how bad i am. i felt like i would only thisappoint hi am. i cried several ti ames in school, i cried on his shoulders. he told me about his own narcissistic parents, he told me that he had been an alcoholic like me. one ti ame i was so miserably crying, i noticed tears in his eyes. generally he was a pretty gruff person, but it all changed when he talked to me. he even offered to land me some money, so i wouldn t have to work so much. i felt so bad, i did not want to let hi am down. i felt like i did not deserve a single minute of the ti ame he gave me. i started skipping his classes. i felt so guilty, i could not even look into his eyes. he once confronted me about it i think i have done much more for you in these years . we do not go to school now because of the coronavirus. i did not even say goodbye to hi am, i do not know if i would ever see hi am again. even if i do, i would not be brave enough to tell hi am this. i do not think he has any idea how much i love hi am and how much he means to me. he is not only a role model, but a father i wanted so badly. how do i tell hi am how sorry i am? how he saved me from commiting suicide so many ti ames. how he believed in me, and how i let hi am down. should i write hi am an email? but i do not want to cause hi am more problems. i do not want hi am to feel bad for me, i want hi am to forget me. i do not want to blame hi am for the stupid coping mechanisms of my sick mind. it is only my fault that i could not deal with this. but i do not want hi am to be angry at me, or feel like i am angry at hi am. i hate myself. how do i make up for this? is that even possible? i deserve to die. i feel like a fucking idiot writing this. i am aware that i had an opportunity that is exceptional for children of nparents. my parents were right after all, i am in fact a horrible person.	moderate

corona isolation is driving me insane hey so i usually do not post anything here and when i do it is usually my worst state of mind. i am from slovakia. my country is not on a total lockdown but it might soon be. i can sti will leave my house but tbh i do not have any friends in my small town. my girlfriend my only source of happiness the past months lives one hour away and we can not see each other. it is making me hopeless because we have no idea how much longer this wi will go on. and when wi will it end. probably not that soon. i just, i feel like i am going insane being stuck at home which is weird because all i ever wanted was to be stuck at home for a month. now i can not do it. i live with my parents i am but they are usually at work the whole day. i am just so lonely here. and it is making me anxious that i can not see my girlfriend for god knows how long. any advice on not being in this depressive rut? when i can not go anywhere or see anybody?	moderate
i am tired of people telling me what to do in order to make my depression go away. shower! have a milkshake! think more positive! dye your hair! that is not how it works. these things do not even provide any sort of enjoyment because anhedonia is a bitch. i understand doing these things is better than doing nothing at all, but they do not even begin to touch this...darkness. it is si amply too damn pervasive. i also understand that they are just trying to help me get better. people have been very worried about me. i appreciate their concern sort of , and i can see that they are trying to help in the only way they know how. but it is rather unwelcome advice. i do not need to be told what to do, i just need people to listen to understand . it is very frustrating and makes me feel even more guilty like a burden because i can not make myself get better.	moderate
my whole life reputation is a lie hi guys, my thoughts have been all over the place for the past few days so the body of this post may not be as structured as it should be. my whole life has been a series of thisappointments with a few good bits here and there. my dad was abusive to us and my mum but she sti will believes the sun shines out of his ass. i used to see hi am maybe twice a year at ti ames because he lived in another city and fucking left my mum with children to raise all on her own and she was sti will faithfull to hi am all those years. my mum made us think he was superman and it is taken me many years to realize just how much damage he did to us. we had a very sheltered upbringing. most of my friends were people i went to school with. i did not talk to any neighbours or anything. not having a father figure and being raised mostly by my mum meant that there were certain things about being a man which i had to learn from other men or did not learn at all. i am pretty okay looking but my self esteem is in the gutters. on saturday evening, i was expecting a girl i met her at work to come visit me. i knew she liked me a lot because despite her having a boyfriend of years, she sti will got on the bus. i then started to think about all the thiscussions that got me to that point. i had lied to this girl from the very first word i spoke to her. i knew what i was doing when i said certain things to make her fall for me. after realizing that the entire i amage of me she had was a lie, i had a mental breakdown, returned home and told her not to come anymore. now this is where this shitty feeling of depression comes in... during this nervous breakdown, i started to look back on my entire life and i realized that i have been a pathological liar all this while. currently, i am , male, and as far back as high school, all the lies i had told people about how rich my parents were. i lied about things i clai amed i did just to make myself seem cooler . now, started coming back to me and i just realized how stupid i must have looked to everyone. i lied that i had been on holiday multiple ti ames abroad when i had never left the country for one day. i lied about having sex and losing my virginity this ti ame in university when i really had not. i lied to my coworkers about previously having been a boxer. i have never stepped in a boxing gym in my life. the lies i mentioned above are just a small fraction of stupid, unnecessary lies i told people. i said these lies to the extent that i started to believe them myself and they became part of me. but i am sure as hell the people i told these lies to never did which makes me feel even more ashamed of myself. i have so many skeletons in my closet when i did those things, they all seemed normal to me but these past it seems all my mistakes and stupid decisions have come back to haunt me at once. i feel extremely guilty and sad. the world does not need people like me. now i do not even know who i am or what the future holds for me. i do not feel a lying ass creep like me deserves to have good, fruitful relationships with anyone... maybe that is why my social life is complete garbage. the silver lining to this is that at least now i know the stupid things i used to do and i kind op have an idea of how to make things better for myself. for starters, i am going to start actually boxing because i think it wi will help me overcome these demons. i am also going to try to stop myself whenever i notice my behaviour tending towards my old self. i have booked my first therapy session this weekend too.	moderate
a plea for help the title is true. i need help, and i have none. so far the only friends who i have talked to have not helped. and i am too nervous and anxious to ask anyone else for help. seeing a therapist or counci willor i just do not want to do, it seem scary, i am anxious to do it and i do not have enough spare ti ame for it. despite all of that. i feel unfixable. a lost cause. even if i did go to therapy, or a friend reached out. they sti will wouldn t be able to help me i feel. every day i get worse and am constantly feeling the same and doing the same things. listening to depressing music, barely eating and sti will gaining weight and fat. saying i wi will exercise then feeling too depressed and tired to later. doing nothing for hours. working until pm then waking up at am to only feel worse about myself for eating the tiniest amount of food. there is no purpose in my life, nothing good going for me, no one to care for or live for. the only reason i am sti will alive is because i am scared of committing suicide and i would not burden my family. it would be so easy to just end it all, i would have no more worries, bad feelings, useless work or effort in general. i could just be in peace and cease living this repetitive depressing spiral. the thing that scares me most, is that i wi will keep living like this for my life. i can not see why it would end, there ll come a ti ame where i probably wi will just end it, but for now i have to keep feeling so fucking shit. i wish someone would come over and just shoot me. my one wish, to die.	moderate

no, you really can not relate. what i feel is not part of your cool depression trend . it is not cool to spend entire days feeling like you re being choked and not able to breathe. it is not fun to wake up and not want to do anything for the entire day. it is not normal if so many of your closest friends have tried to commit or want to commit suicide. i do not feel relatable when i am spending days drinking away the pain deep inside my heart and mind. how do i really feel? i feel like i am lost with nowhere to belong i feel like i am worthless to even my family and friends. i am scared that maybe all i am meant for is to be the poster child for mental health awareness. i strive to be greather than what i am, but do not feel like i am actually worth what i want to be. i feel like an outcast everywhere i go. i want to go outside to get away from home but i want to go home because i hate being outside. so no my friend, i do not think you can relate... as much i wished you could.	moderate

always worrying about personal appearance, what others think about me i am a yr old virgin. in terms of appearance, i have a unique look to myself, my right side of my face is very attractive but because of a surgery that went wrong the left side of my face lost a lot of bone and looks really weird. also my nose was crushed. genetically i should have been good looking, my mom was a model and my dad was really good looking and had a babyface. i look like frankenstein. i have had girls show interest after only seeing me from a certian side but after hanging around me they always lose interest, a girl who once called me hot even told me afterwards i was not that great looking as she thought. yeah, cold as fuck. all this makes me worry so much.	moderate

a never ending cycle do not you think what we have is just such a never ending vicious cycle? this condition just makes us withdraw ourselves from everything, which then makes the condition even worse. we feel lonely, but then we self isolate ourselves from our friends and then we feel even lonelier. i know i am getting more and more thistant from some of my friends or at least i thought they were my friends , they probably do not know the heck why, and i never tell because thiscussing about mental health is such non commonality in the society i belong to plus social anxiety makes things x harder, and i feel even more sad because they do not seem to even sense something is amiss and never bothered to ask why. i sti will have a handful of friends who knows and cares, and i am thankful for them. but when i think of it, it hurts me, when people whom you thought might care, does not. and then when i decided to say fuck it, let us go try something new, then the world decides to throw this pandemic on us, stumbling up all my plans for the year. ever since i have been diagnosed with depression, i just feel like every step i make is an uphi will battle, and i am so tired. every ti ame i get the i willusion that i am getting better, then some stupid thing comes out of nowhere making me take steps backward. it is tiring, and it makes me question my very existence in this world.	moderate

i hate life right now hi, i am going through a really rough period and it feels as though everything is getting on top of me. i am a second year student studying computer science with games programming and i am really struggling. right now i have deadlines due in one in ten days. luckily i have almost completed the programming for the one in ten days, but i sti will have to write the report and fix little bits. the rest of them are causing me so much anxiety and stress, and i do not feel like i am going to pass them at all. i do not feel like i have learned much at all in my ti ame here, i hate lectures with a passion because just sitting there listening to someone drone on about something when they would rather not be there does not help me at all, and honestly, i am just completely burnt out and exhausted. everything feels like the biggest job in the world even just sleeping and waking up feels difficult and heavy, nevermind having to code an ai and understand quantum computing. i have tried to do my own research, get stuff done on ti ame and look after myself during all this but i just can not do it anymore. i am struggling to remember anything, i barely even remember yesterday. every day feels the exact same. then it comes to placements. i have applied for some placements and thus far have not been accepted for any of them. i have just applied for the final one that i am actually interested in and am really, really hoping that i get it because i know that i wi will be really thisadvantaged if i do not get one. additionally, the placement sounds awesome and i literally can not do another year of education straight after this one, i would end up just dropping out. i think what is really frustrating to me is that all of the placements have expected us to know several things in a great detail of depth which i amo, we have not been taught. i have tried to look at this stuff online and in books, and just can not concentrate on it. i am too burnt out to read and remember the stuff, plus i find learning from books to be just as bad as lectures. the modules which are meant to be teaching us this stuff have either been on strike or have not covered topics in depth enough to meet the placement is needs. we have also had lessons canceled due to strikes for months and now the uni is doing all lessons online due to coronavirus i do not feel like we have been taught much at all and i know that i am going to struggle with online teaching more than i do in person. for two of my modules, we have just been told to copy and paste stuff and that is it. my head is just constantly thinking about uni and work over and over and i can not seem to get it to stop. i just really needed to rant. if anyone has any advice for me or anything then that would be greatly appreciated. thanks	moderate

i do not see any other way out trigger warning hi everyone, my depression has been getting worse for the past year or so to the point now i feel like suicide is the only possible way for me. when i try to think about the future, my mind just goes blank. the feeling of waiting for the inevitable with so little motivation and so much negativity has completely taken over my life. my psychiatrist told me to go jogging because exercise is the best way to beat depression. due to the corona virus, he told me to play games, watch videos, listen to music instead. when i said that i was not motivated, he had a look of thisappointment on his face and told me i could not do nothing and expect i amprovements. the meds have not been working very well either so i am going downhi will fast. i am sti will going through a breakup so right now my psychiatrist is the only person i trust like . i wouldn t be able to go out even if corona virus was not a thing. i do not know what to do. even if i were able to survive this, i sti will wouldn t want to live the rest of my life. i hate this world, the lies, the hypocrisy, selfishness, rudeness. i feel like i am holding onto something that does not even exist. what do you think i should do at this point? thank you. stay strong everyone lt 	moderate

so depressed, feel like a shell of a person. was struggling with being lonely before and this virus stuff now has me feeling like the whole world is falling apart. i struggle with anxiety too and have a history of panic attacks so this is not fun. and i can not go online anywhere without seeing it. so i tell myself i should just focus on being present in my life and cleaning and cooking and whatnot but no. i get so lonely and sad. see my life is already quite isolated and i was already unhappy and depressed over everything so this is just the way it is for me. i have been trying hard to get my kids out and meeting new people as we just moved here but now ugh. it is so hard! and my son is sad a lot of ti ames too. we are just struggling as a family. i did finally get to bed at a decent ti ame last night but then woke at am wracked with fear and anxiety. just my body was freaking out, heart racing, mind racing. i finally fell asleep when it was am or so. those few seconds when i first wake up are heaven, because my brain has not registered anything yet. once it does it is like oh crap, i am sti will here. i am just so tired of hating my life! i want to be happy! i have a lot of things that i guess for people are like life goals but i never actually wanted this lifestyle. and i have been trying to figure out how to change things to make me happy and not hurt my family just so i can be happy. like i am married, i homeschool, i have support from my parents and good relationship with them. but that is not the whole picture by far. i am actually so lonely, so struggling every day just to do basic things like shower because i am so depressed and i hate myself. i feel like a huge epic failure of a person. i gave up everything i ever wanted in my life and now i am just so stuck and have been for a very long ti ame. it is all a long messy, nonsensical story that i wi will not bother to bore you with. all that just to say i am sad, i am stuck, i am trying my best but it never seems good enough and even on a good day i feel empty and hollow. a shell of a person.	moderate

where to go? hi, as the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely li amited? my gp can only organise pi wills for me. i have no way of acquiring a therapist. i have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about november. i do not have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that i could open up to. i tried a while ago but i ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they are sorry or they wish they could help. you know, the empty you can talk to me, it wi will get better . then they cut contact. my boyfriend just says he does not know how to help me and has phases of randomly compli amenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. i am sure he tries his best but i just wish i had more support and he says he can not help me anymore than he does everyti ame. i feel so trapped. i always have to pretend i am fine. i always cover up with humor. it seems like i am insincere or dramatic when i finally snap and just say i am a mess. i can not afford a therapist. my university counselling office would not help me. they offered a suicide hotline numbers ? and we re sorry but this is not a psychological support that we do here . how to cope? where to go?	moderate
please help me please ignore my grammatical errors and thank you if you are reading this so the thing is i am trying so hard to be happy and ignore the toxic people in life but the thing is i do not have friends, not a girlfriend. this is eating me inside making me awkward around people which gives the weird vibe around people. i am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends. there were some people in my life which i thought would stay around me so i ignored toxicity and thought it wi will become better but it backfired me because when i tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all. now i do not know how to make myself innocent and they have played with my emotions and i want to prove myself and want pay for there deeds i am trying so hard to do not give a f ck but overthinking is ki willing me and i am losing all my self confidence and self respect.	moderate

venting a bit i realized recently that i might have bipolar thisorder based on a couple of friends i know who have it and also the symptom checklists that i have looked at. i have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it is felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme opti amism and sociability, and pessi amism is day depression. anyways i was looking online and found an online counseling website. one of the boxes you have to fi will out is info that the counselor wi will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. as i was fi willing it out i poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than i ever had to anyone before, even myself. i was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. then i hit the next page button and it brought me to the payment section. never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. i understand that it is a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they did not mention that until you have already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. it felt like they were saying, okay what is going on, what is wrong? oh no that is unfortunate, now before i give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, i am going to need your credit card info. oh you can not afford it, well fuck off then. it is am where i live and i feel completely stuck. i am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that i have to pay for help with something i did not ask for and wouldn t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. i do not know where i would be if i had visited the site without the semi level head that i have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being. i do not want to get too political on this sub but honestly fuck capitalism right now end of vent going to delete this tomorrow when the other side of my personality gets mad for posting this hope you all have a good and safe night	moderate
i made a poem symbolizing my current life right now. depressing, but writing poems is my only hope of backing off the edge right now for me i look down, down toward the eternal chasm of peace, along with solitude and darkness, but peace nonetheless. i summon all my wi will, but the mind stops me. so close, yet so far. all i now do is wait, waiting for the push, the push that ll bring me to rest. but it never came.	moderate
i am angry at my family for something they could not possibly know and i am so mean. i wanted to ki will myself a couple days ago. my family was supposed to leave the house for a few hours, which would give me ti ame to do it. they did not leave and i am so angry. it is not fair on them. they could not know. but i am sti will so angry. i am not supposed to be alive right now and yet, here i am. and it is all because they decided not to go. if i had chosen not to, been moments away and stopped because i am a coward, that would have been fine. but no. i do not even get to blame myself for it. i just wanted it to be over but now i have to keep going for longer. i hate myself for hating them over this.	moderate
i think i am depressed. i have lost interest in nearly everything. i dont know the reason why its happening. i i amagine myself being hurt or dying but dont want to commit suicide because i want to support my family. hi i am a yo boy. i someti ames think that its not depression and its just a feeling that would go away but it comes back from ti ame to ti ame. i think i have lost my identity. friends tell me i used to be enthusiastic. although my family members are not aware because i am good at hiding things but they also notice that nothing interests me. i indulge myself in activities like eating, playing video games and studying to thistract myself from these thoughts. also i did not had any traumatic phase in life and hence i dont know what is causing it. i am out of energy most of the day. i sleep a lot especially in afternoon and wake ti will late night. is it depression or something else. please tell how to cope it.	moderate

my emotional numbness won so basically for a while ive been unable to feel emotions. i can see horrible things without feeling bad, i can not be happy and i can not have fun and i just feel dead inside. but i have a teacher that i really liked for a while now. idk if i loved her or not, i didnt feel anything i loved talking with her and i always looked forward to the next day and every ti ame i stopped talking with her i got a bit down i guess and every ti ame she smiled it made me smile. but idk, its not like that anymore. i dont really care about her anymore, i dont look forward to tomorrow anymore and seeing her again everyday is not the same. i think my depression emotional numbness ki willed my love for her. living sucks.	moderate
hating what i used to love i do not know if this is the right place to post about this, but i thought i would give it a shot. i have been an artist my whole life, ever since i can remember. i went through many years of art school, and while studying i was doing well. art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and i have always wanted to be an artist more than anything else. but i have also had mental health issues my entire life, and i have gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. i have been medicated since i was a child, so that is helped most of the ti ame. but now, starting last autumn, i have gone into a depressive period that is a bit different than the previous ones. i think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. i did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so i think burnout is very likely. in any case, i started to notice that i did not enjoy drawing anymore. drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. it started to feel like way too much work and that work was not interesting or exciting. the work was also difficult and just so much. so many lines. honestly, when i think about drawing i start to feel physically unwell. i have been advised to take a break from drawing, and i am doing so. i have not actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and i am going for one month. i am just so terrified that i wi will never enjoy drawing again. i can not even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. but i sti will want to be an artist so much. plus, i honestly do not have any other hobbies unrelated to art that i could focus on. nothing else really interests me. i should also mention that i am switching medications right now, and i am about to go onto a full dose of my new medication which is actually one that is worked for me in the past . i have never experienced anything like this, and i am so scared. any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.	moderate
do these things you do not like that wi will take up all your ti ame and energy and and maybe you ll feel better! eating healthy, exercising, socializing, cleaning, meditating, getting sunlight, talking to a therapist, etc. none of them have made a noticeable difference in how i feel, and i am tired of trying to do them all when it is just more adding to my struggle.	moderate

depression from chronic iniury hi all, i have dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and cbt. however i have had failed shoulder surgeries since and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself. i can not play basketball anymore which i loved, i have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well. when i try something that i can no longer do our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway it usually means i wi will be down for the rest of the day. i know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but i often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries. does anyone recommend a book, a method of cbt or any advice for me to deal with this better? thanks in advance, i appreciate reading this sub, this is my first ti ame posting.	moderate
depression or laziness? for quite a long ti ame now, i have been restless, not enjoying life at all anhedonia , and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. for a while i thought i was lazy, but i am quite a rational person, and even when i have made full sense of why i should get up and do a thing, i recede into doing nothing again. i just do not seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. i have no passions or liking to things, i just sit there on my computer all day tv. most days i see no reason to get up or do anything healthy productive. it is quite a nihilistic out view i have. i must say, i am quite opti amistic. as contradictory as that sounds i always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result. am i extremely lazy or depressed? i sure feel down most of the ti ame, when i am with friends it is okay, but it is not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however i feel emotionless most of the ti ame. this has been going on for at least a year or two and i really need to get work done and get on with my life so i do not fall behind. any help would be appreciated 	moderate
i am a mess right now i have no one to listen to my problems so i thought i would write them down. then i decided to post it on here. just moved to a new city and started at a new school. i do not miss anything from my old hometown, i am actually quite happy to be somewhere else. moving has been tough though. i had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends. i have kind of joined a group of friends at school. they are all pretty nice. the dynamic of the group is a little weird though. its like introverts who do not talk much, myself included, and strongly opinionated extroverts. they mostly seem like a nice group of people though. in regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. it is hard not to get i ampatient and blame myself though. i feel like i am being ungrateful because even though i think i have been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what i want, i sti will feel so shit. i have never been diagnosed but i think i could have depression and or anxiety. i would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but i do not want to tell my parents how i feel. over the past few years i have thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three ti ames in my life. i have been thinking about it a lot recently. i have been researching pi wills i can get at a chemist that i could overdose on and i have found a suicide bridge that is very close to my house. i have been told that i should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments does not seem worth it someti ames. i am starting to find it hard to trust myself. i am like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. during the brief moments when i feel happy about something i worry about my emotions causing me to do something i regret. when i am sad or empty it is all i can think about. there is this girl who is not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. she seems like a really nice person. we do not see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. i am unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it is making me dizzy. i really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but i am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake i make. i feel kind of like it wi will never happen, yet i spent the whole afternoon texting her. i feel like i am going insane. the people i admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you re always left wanting more from them. i aspire to be like this and make other people happy. i need to remember to smile more though. usually i have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non existent. a month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and has not changed much, i think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the ti ame. i just started waking up at am every morning out of nowhere and i can not stop. i do not know what the fuck is happening to me. i feel so lonely. i just want someone to talk to and listen to. getting to that point with someone new takes ti ame and i am getting kind of i ampatient. i do not know what to do to make myself happy. if things worked out with this girl i think i would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful. wow, this ended up really long.	moderate
i am starting to feel like i am not meant for this world anymore i am , and i have been feeling this way ever since i was . i have no friends, social anxiety and i have been homeschooled since i was . and to top it all off, i have asperger is syndrome. i would give away everything i have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal. my anxiety has gotten so bad that i can barely even go out anymore. i for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. i almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. i do not think i wi will ever make it there. i like a lot of stuff that i am sure no one my age likes and i get angry at my relatives for no reason. i hate being a teen. why do hormones exist? why is everything so complicated? why am i losing my mind? i never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. i wish i could go back in ti ame and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. i come from a good family, so it is not family related. only thing i do is isolate myself from the entire world my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. i can not do anything else. the only thing keeping me alive is my family. i cry or feel like crying whenever i picture them looking in horror at me taking my life.	moderate
can i leave some baggage here i am not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, i am on mobile and i am lost. not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc. okay so i am m i guess i have been dealing with depression for about years. i have anxiety , i am self conscious and i like to believe i am more fucked up than i actually am and if it is okay here i would like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where i am now to no one in particular. i was never the popular kid. i was known but never popular. i was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because i wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but i pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. i got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, i played by myself. i had about or friends for most of pri amary school kindergarten grade . not knowing how to interact with the other kids i was lonely. i didnt realize i was lonely as it was well normal for me. the world was out to get me and i let it, i had no voice. i didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how i felt. i was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. interpret them. i know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? using them? you d have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. but this is how i was brought up and its what i knew. life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was thistorted and i had a fake i amage of what it was. because of this i matured faster in other aspects of life. i grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to everyone else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. i felt like everyone hated me and thought i was some annoying kid so i shut myself off from the world. that is the first few years of life. i ran around as a happy lonely kid. as i grew up and was about or i learned to read people and guess what they were feeling thinking, how their day was going and shit. i learned to feed off of everyone is emotions around me rather than feeling my own. i essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now i am struggling with fixing it. i fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, i i amitated them and copied them to feel included. i grew up like this trying to fi will that big empty lonely hole i felt, i buried it deep down and as a green swamp friend of mine once said i became an onion, i made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my intention, fuck it let us continue the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to protect everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, i didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. i lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. it was repulsive and wrong but i didnt know that. i would say this is when i got my first taste of depression around the age of . grades i was the class runt guinne pig doormat, i was the kid being bullied. the other kids unani amously decided i was the kid they picked on. fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the teachers would pick on me. so i accepted who i was and that was the school fuck up. i tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. yea it worked for a bit as armor. i made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. but grade is when the smack down really started to happen and i became... the germ. these kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. this was the tipping point for me. all my so called classmates and friends i had suddenly turned on me and i was alone. truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. i broke. i broke into so many little pieces, all those people i grew up around people i trusted turned. i could not touch anyone with out them screaming dont touch me germ great thanks now i have to wash myself and other hurtful shit like that. they could not even sit in a chair i had used without washing it and sanitizing it. okay i say i was alone but i had friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn t back down. half way thru the school year i attempted suicide. i had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, i drew a little blood but it hurt to much so i stuck around. i had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like i asked hi am to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close i was to not being here. so he told that i wasnt feeling good in my head, that i was going thru some tough ti ames due to the class and what they were doing. this teacher had clue that it was happening and i ammediately went to the principal. brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. i played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. i didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked hi am what was up. after he started to say something i broke, i told them almost everything. about me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how i wished everyone else would die first. i didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. my worst fears had come true, i spoke up and now everyone hated me. they could not bully me but did they hate me. after the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts yes i told them i had thoughts, no i didnt tell them i tried i came back into the class room and i am greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. the first thing this kid told me who i thought was one of the people that i had as an acquaintance you know op fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? you want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? next ti ame think before you speak . i can not tell you how much this affected me. that kid got sent home for the rest of the week. this is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? no those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. grade was a repeat of grade . aging more and more i hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. elementary school behind me and moving to middle school i made new friends, a new chapter in life. friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me mysteriouslyreddited . i started to notice girls at this point too. two girls in particular, quinn and anna. quinn is a couple years younger than i had been babysat by my mother and i by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. and she, well quinn is amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. and her smile . . just everything. she was my first crush although quickly forgotten we went to different schools. you know out of sight out of mind. k not like that but i had not seen her in a while . anna on the other had, well i can describe her si amilarly, but things were different with anna. they were. easier??? its. well she was the girl i fell head over heels for and she knew it. we talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. i continued on the same way i did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. anna and i stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. i got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, i introduced her to a couple guys i knew she was crushing on and i enjoyed watching her be with them as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. bad idea would recommend. and well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. wrong. i was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. i do not remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. it became personal for the both of us. i told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and i thought i was okay with it. i learned quickly that i in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and i was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. i was having more and more suicidal thoughts. i had spiraled to my lowest point that i have ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? its not oof my bad. i was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. the fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes i felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same ti ame was almost outweighing the good i felt for her. i cut everyday for over years. i didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. my entire depressive episode was brought on because i could not stand up for myself or tell myself it is okay or when to stop. i lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. or at least i thought i lost everything when in reality i was only just thiscovering life. i became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. i became a robot. i woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played cod or skyri am and went to bed. rinse repeat and that is how i lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. i sti will have not reconnected with anna anna if you end up reading this i am sorry for the bad memories. i like to think that we sti will have some love left for each other but i know that is false . as i lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. being brought up as a christian i was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask hi am for help. i called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? my grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare i speak about god in that manor. after mass one sunday i would have been like we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how i had not been on one in years and i would like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. it was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. i inquired if i could go with them and because of my grades i was told no. i told them if they let me go i would pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing i know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled i am and that id be lucky to consider even going. me being the teen i was i yelled back. fuck yous were exchanged. my grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. we had a fist fight that ended up with hi am having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and hi am thrown onto the floor. he got up and started to yell get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!! . i replied with well then i guess it wasnt nice knowing you. when you re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are and left without looking back. he did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. that night after we made up and got a blizzard i went home to find my mother is husband fuming because of how i talked to my mother which cause a fight with hi am. that was the night i lost my home, my family, he had thisowned me and cast me out like garbage. even tho that was one of my lowest points i didnt see it as a loss. yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what i want when i want. so i started working on myself. i moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. while i did cli amb out of my depressing hole i have yet to beat depression. i got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. well now i am going to skip ahead to why i wanted to get some baggage off my back. a few weeks ago i went out to the bar with some friends and i ran into none other than quinn. i would had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while i was there. i didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. so i was already drunk, feeling great, i would seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so i just smiled and ignored her. well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. i mean if you were me you d find it i ampossible to. so i did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if i could buy her a drink and from what i remember we hit it off. i had a blast but tbh i was not looking for anything in her i just remembe how i used to feel but more i amportantly j remembered all the fun ti ames we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. i was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. so we were talking, and i looked at her and ti ame just seemed to stop. we talked but i do not remember what it was about. at one point i asked if i could kiss her. my self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. there is so much that i wish i could remember about that night but i can not. i dont know what happened what i said or did. this is the hardest i have had to fight this depression in a long ti ame and this ti ame i am worried that i would not be able to win. i do not recognize who i am anymore. i dont like this person i have become. i love my gf but i feel like i am going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. i feel like i am not good enough for her and i am hurting her by being with her. i can not stop thinking about quinn but i think i fucked up even trying to be friends with her. there was a small spark there but nothing major besides i dont want there to be a spark right now, i have talked to my gf and she knows i have feelings for another. it was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that i am struggling with my feelings and that i am not looking for a way to leave her. i have been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. i am not crossing that line because when i do there is no turning back. i am tired of being depressed and i want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if i can keep all my current bridges or if i have to go out and build new bridges. i am

does anybody feel si amilar? when i am mentally stable i am quite in touch with my emotions. i could definitely be better at it, but i usually know what i am feeling and why i feel that way. i tend to rationalize my feelings and often try to think myself out of negative emotions, which i am working on, but overall it is all right. when i am depressed i do not know shit about my emotions. either i feel nothing at all or everything at once and i do not know where these emotions come from. i feel like all my emotions get mixed together and have one final destination feeling depressed. especially negative emotions like sadness, anger or anxiety do not exist in a pure form like they do when i am doing well. but even if i start to feel somewhat happy the destination is feeling depressed. in this case my thought process looks something like this oh, that is genuinely nice, i really start enjoying it but it is going to be over soon, someday it wi will stop existing just like everything yeah, basically everything is pointless anyway gt feeling depressed. does anybody feel that way?	moderate
my life story, i am sorry it is so long hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, i am very deperate and on the brink of ki willing myself, there is so much to life this i know. unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since i was born. before i say what i came here to ask here is alittle backstory... backstory throughout my mom is pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure i was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and i came out not only a boy according to what i have been told and what is written on my birth certificate i was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes do not know if that is the clinical term, but basically up until i was or can not remember i was unable to open my eyes all the way , and various other problems. i have always felt like i should not have been born a boy let alone live past weeks another failed diagnosis, lucky me right? . my childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all i wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and can not talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you could not even be born right. since my conciousness first made its way into this world i have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if i managed to get it right. my dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course i was informed my dad had the chance to come to america when i was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and i am sure he had other reasons. my mom always worked all the ti ame so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some ti ame. an older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how i talked and how i acted. my brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he is done it. i am sure he was unaware of how i felt inside but it traumatized me so much i am afraid of being myself. my body is not shaped how normal guy is are either so i have no idea how to take that problem. at school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked. once i turned my mom met a man, let us call hi am d. d was is military and i later found out they got married quick span of a few months to finance my surgeries because i came from a background of poverty being single parent with kids later . i was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. i was always forced to do everything for everybody else. my brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, i had to do it, stuff like that. to this day i get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they do not know how . i have always been used all my life. i am nothing but a tool. as i patiently waited for the surgeries that i was supposed to get atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal when i was , then delayed to , then , and finally at . i received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. medical history the doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest is fat which i did not even care about having in the first place i just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. i was put in a maxi willary thistractor fancy name for cage on my head . to move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate roof of my mouth and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing i have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. it did however i amprove my speech just a tiny bit. i had to wear this crap o. my head for months. later i then made my own appointments years later and got a surgery for bonegraft. i am sti will missing the tooth i amplant which i can not afford nor wi will i ever be able to, and i have to have another surgery on my nose again. i have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. also i have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either i have got something going on down there that should not be or when i was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy . as for the other reasons why i am highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. i was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. i wanted to go to college but i wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so i can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to hi am for school use. i agree and then he turns and days yea no... do it yourself . landing me k debt that i can not pay, k i was forced to pay just to get my diploma and k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. before this though i was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not god is plan. since when i brought up the idea he straight refused. i was not allowed to work or go out, i did not have an allowance or any type of money except money i got for my birthday dollars every year, ages and it did not help that i had no friends up until senior year in highschool that summer is the only happy memories i have after leaving my home town. he was very controlling that is why i feel i can not do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma i have faced. i did however keep the promis i made to myself about joining the military. unfortunately though i was not let in. after two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork i was finally sent to meps for the marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. nope! once i get there i take the asvap and score on the higher side i know right smarts actually came in handy i might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side scored . go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if i always been tall and skinny i have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis i say yes, normal ok cool then i go to the eye exam and they tell me i have astigmatism in my left eye this i knew it happened when i was about or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail i went to see if i can get this fixed they said and i quote the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution i can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over ti ame, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this ti ame. lasik doctor. so dream job at marines no go. the meps people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. i do and same thing they say i can not join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks god. at this point i start thinking maybe it is not meant to be and give up. my job history is halarious, atleast to me. almost even did not get hired. first job at age , mcdonald s. mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis he thought it was so curved he can not have sex yet he never tried, now he is depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave hi am circomsition this happened during my attempt at joining the marines. throughout the course of months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how god hates hi am, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming hi am down explaining and telling hi am to be patient cause it is not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. because of the move i am forced to quit my job that i actually enjoyed, to transfer to another mcdonald is on the side of town we moved to two towns down i work there for months before quitting because of how unfairly i was being treated, everything was my fault, i never did anything right, i was lazy, the works even though i did mainly everybody is job in the kitchen, everyday i washed the gri will swept mopped multiple ti ames a day, i would be on gri will then on the table making the burgers, i would go and get the pound boxes from the freezer. you name it i did it. i eventually quit after months bought a one way ticket to california and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying i left and he tried to stop me... i was sick of his shit. i had shit i was dealing with all my life and now i have to deal with you and your problem too, excuse the langauge but fuck outta here with that shit. i have so little control over my own life that i only spent days in california before my mom told the entire family where i was and got my aunt grandma is sister so technically grandma, who is also a nun to somehow convince me to go to new york and stay with my uncle. i can not believe i actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only days i was off to nyc. i told myself it is probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. wrong. i was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. i had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while i was not there to find proof i could pay her dollars to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. with a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. after two months of looking for jobs while making music si amaltaniously i am being called a liar i good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that is what she labeled me. i manage to get a job at mcdonald is again but in ny. i manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. i go back to work and then move into my grandpa is room he was renting. lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. durring this ti ame when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bi wills ulti amately giving hi am what little i had. months pass and after much consideration and mom brother begging for me to come back i oblige. i then get a job at another mcdonald is in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. i work there for months before quitting because of the same drama the first ti ame and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia i was experiencing due to smoking too much the parinoia was about how i hid the fact i am not normal and that i wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life . if you think that is it well your wrong... my aunt comes to the usa on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. my mom is the only one in the usa she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the ti ame being, money my mom did not have, which is fine desperate ti ames desperate measures and such. she stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. the ti ame that she was here i could have used to work on my music the hours i was left alone in the house, but no. everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it is for someone else, complains she did not buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom is clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. she then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. after i go through the trouble of finding and iphone plus for a crazy deal dollars which they usually go for i go and i borrow money to go get her the phone. she then says oh... i wanted a more modern one....like yours.... i am like ugh ok i reset mine give her it and she then says she wi will give me the my phone was iphone x pristine condition . months pass i sti will do not have a job stopped looking to focus on getting my licence , everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so i can not use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before i got the chance to use it and is selling it because he does not want to pay for it. he is not rich but wealthy dollars k in the bank meanwhile i am k in debt of which collectors are being sent now. debt borrowed money i did not have to help pay bi wills to not be called worthless and useless. borrowed too much then took k out and ran away to california that brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long. side note i have always liked girls but it is more like an admiration envy type of thing, always wishing i was one cause i always felt just wrong in my own body ok tl dr shit life should have been born a girl, instead i came out with so many problems and mental issues along with the traumatizing circumstances i was put in and the problems sti will continue.	moderate
just need to vent. my depression has been at its worst recently and i have been trying desperately to find a therapist. the people i usually go through have told me it is a month waiting list and i honestly do not think i wi will be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. i checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. i slept easier last night at the thought that i would be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. i am just so sick of trying to help myself. i know it is not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. they should not allow people to apply if they are not going to be able to help or at least have a warning up. everywhere i have looked so far has said to either wait, go to a amp e or call if it is an emergency. what classifies as an emergency? because i am almost certain i wouldn t be considered one and i do not want to waste their ti ame considering the nhs is already stretched thin. i would pay for a therapist if i had the means but i can barely afford to feed myself right now. i just do not know what to do from here but i do not want to give up.	moderate

i wish to die, because of my constant failures.. for years...my grades are going down, relationship with my parents is deteriorating....i am so alone.... i crave for love and attention, things i am not having anymore...and for some brain especially. i am so stupid, i am always failing at tests, while others are taking great marks. and i took three bad grades fs , lower than i ever took, and my parents do not believe me with anything and screaming and threatening me ... it is being going on for too long. no matter how some people would try to help me... it does not work.i have been to a therapist , it did not work. i feel so bad because people are sweet and kind, and some teachers are good...but a bad teacher gave us a bad mark at tests, because he is cynic, even though we studied and... i wanted to study, but it seems like fate did not want to keep up with me.i had a big dream , and i failed... all in all, i am a failure.... and i deserve to die, right before my th birthday, when it was supposed to be a wonderful ti ame. i am sorry, for everything.	moderate

i cry almost every day, i do not know why. i can no longer evaluate people is attitudes and behavior towards me. everyone seems to hate me. everyone is doing something just to make me sad. although i try to treat people as lovingly and respectfully as i can, they try to make me sad. for example, my friends, my crush and others. i do not know how long my heart wi will last.	moderate
my family does not validate or accept my feelings, so i do not either. over the years, i have been called lazy for wanting to lie in bed, a baby for breaking down and crying, and selfish for wanting any ti ame to myself. when they suspected that i was doing bad things to myself, i was also told that i would burn in hell for it. i was diagnosed with depression, and even the doctor did not really seem to care. so i guess i do not either. i do not take care of myself as much as i should because i am losing my wi will to change. to be better. i am starting to think that i really am just as useless as my family thinks i am.	moderate
i do not care about living anymore over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. at the end of my junior year of high school i had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. thankfully, this acquaintance i had took ti ame out of his day to make music with me at lunch. it really meant a lot to me. he was the only friend i really had at the ti ame. i had hung out with his friends a couple ti ames before throughout high school, so i started playing video games with some of them. eventually during the summer i got really close to them, and i became a part of their friend group. they really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and i had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. i had and sti will am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. in the beginning of senior year i hung out with them after school basically everyday, and it was the happiest i would ever been. i do not want to get into details but then something changed. a bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. i thought they thought i was not as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. i reverted back to the state i was in with my previous girlfriend, and i started to worry incessantly that i would be abandoned by them. my mindset about the group also changed. i felt like i had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. this has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. i have isolated myself from them a lot, and i even feel a bit of anger towards them. there are these events that happen that make me feel like they think i am weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so i constantly try to change myself. i try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what i say. i hate who i am. i can not live with myself. i feel like everyone i interact with thinks i am all of those things, and i can not stand it. i hate everything about myself. my voice, the way i pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. i can not take it anymore. right now i am on mg zoloft. tonight i am going to trip on mg robotussin gels. there is a possibility i could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but i do not care anymore. i just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. it is not even that i am suicidal. i am not trying to ki will myself. but if that is what ends up happening, i do not care. i just do not want to be here.	moderate
missing the sadness i suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where i finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but i feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? or am i going mad? it is like i was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now. i feel so stupid for feeling like this, i am lucky enough to it appears so far gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and i have this sick lust to feel it again? it also come with this constant creeping fear that this ok ness i am feeling now is a facade, that soon something wi will happen and i wi will fall back into my old state instantly. the conflict of this fear and the longing is driving me a little mad. i can not talk to anyone i know about it because i am pretty sure i am going to sound insane, so i guess i am asking you guys. tldr recovered from depression but missing the depth to which i felt emotions before, missing the release that comes with sadness of that extreme, every other emotion feels a little uncomfortable now, anyone else experienced this?	moderate
almost there.. just wondering if anyone is having the same problem as i. i am struggling for about years now and i am not getting better anyti ame soon. i am getting sick of the job that i am doing, although i am good at it but it does not mean that it is what i want to do for the rest of my working life. the problem is i can not seem to stay at this type of job for more than a year. ive been with companies already within that span of years. plus i am losing my wi will to even work because i am about to lose my son, my partner and i had this stupid fight and decided to cut my ties between them. i am so lost right now and i can not sleep most of the ti ame. i dont know what to do. problems keep on adding and adding up. i need some advices to keep me sane. or i might end up dead one day.	moderate
i just want to cry alone. holy shit things went bad fast. last year i went into deep depression, however i recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. i got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. however the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. my parents decided they wanted to try some parenting and decided i spent too much ti ame on video games . even though i really only played hours a night. it was one of the main ways i interacted with my friends as well. after that they decided that my phone was thistracting me so it was confiscated as soon as i got home from school. then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. the worst part is i do not even know why they are doing all of this. my grades were good, a is and b is and in ap classes while working hours a week and maintaining a social life. everything was going so good. now i get home and feel empty and alone. i can not even cry in privacy. then they have the audacity to ask honey whats wrong, why are you sad????? . i just dont understand.	moderate

i hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs. i have been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, i am a full ti ame late night janitor for a courthouse just miles away from my hometown. working there has been pretty easy, but i wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering i do not really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much. so just today i came home late as usual, and i have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that i took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. i told her that i did not really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. despite attempting to change the topic and explain why i have not been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. what an ungrateful little bastard i am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. at that moment i was legiti amately about to begin to cry. but rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression olympics and proclai am her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. i got out just before my first tear would legiti amately run down my cheek. and even before i went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more this is why you d make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel considering i had practice driving this morning. unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she did not seem to care. thanks for reading, i hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. along with having a parent who does not make your suffering all about them and why you should not be depressed.	moderate
hi i need help. i have not been happy since i was years old. here i am years later trying to get out of the depression hole i dug for myself. therapy would not help. it is to the point where everyday for the past three months i have thought about suicide. i lost three of my best friends already. i only have a couple friends left. i used to cry myself to sleep but now i just sit for hours on end thinking and searching for a reason to live. i can not cry anymore, no matter how much i try. i do not need any pms telling me that life is worth living. i do not need lies saying that people love me. if they loved me they wouldn t hurt me and throw me away like garbage. if they loved me i wouldn t be in the situation i am in right now. i fake my happiness so that they do not worry about me. i build an armor around my heart to protect myself and others. i try to build a wall but it does not work. i just keep falling deeper and deeper into my hole. i lost, angry and i tired. tired of being here. i do not need people to constantly check up on me. i just want to isolate myself. so i do not have to be loved by all my friends. i am done. i am sorry	moderate

look me in the eye and tell me it gets better. go out, too out of your mind with sleep deprivation to be coherent, sit around at home feeling like shit in all respects, have both of your parents thismiss that anything is wrong while pouring gas on the fire by being passive aggressive every ti ame they interact with you, and when it seems like things might change, whether it is your own efforts or the environment just shifting, it all circles back to being the same again. the ride never ends.	moderate

may take college medical withdrawal but i wi will be broke? long read i am at a cross roads. yesterday, i had a mid term and showed up minutes late. i had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though i told her that i needed to be at school . unfortunately this didnt help the fact that i havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. my programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that i missed. though again, yesterday i was told that i am approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. this year just isnt my year. i feel withdrawn from everything and just can not bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. me missing my classes is also something i told my therapist and psychiatrist about. my professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. i appreciated the consideration until early today, when i realized that i most likely wi will not be attending lab today either. i can not keep doing this. this is the second ti ame i have taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. the first ti ame was alright but this ti ame...is terrible. i dont have a support group like last ti ame and i dont have a team. my first ti ame, i was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but i sti will had a long stride of actually passing then. i have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. she got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. i dont know why we can not stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. if i leave school, i am faced with having to leave my school job. if i lose my school job, i wi will not have any funds. my mother wi will be leaving me in our hometown and i wi will not be able to get help from her like i need . i know that if i withdraw, i wi will not be able to withdraw from one class, i would have to leave all of them. i didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. so, i am scared to leave school. i am diagnosed with depression and gad. i would be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that i wi will be holding my grad year back and i wi will not be able to conjure up funds. i wanted to love school. i know i can love learning but i can not seem to love that or anything else right now. i was supposed to be graduating this year but i souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. i had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten ti ame but ...that is all gone. i dont know what to do. should i schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where i dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when i am better? its hard making a living without a college degree and i am worried. i want to stop the self sabotage of depression but it is as if i can not.	moderate

is this depression or something else? really struggling. hello everyone, just to preface my doctor has diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ocd. recently i have been fi willed with self hatred. i am and weigh pounds. i am convinced i am fat even though this is a very average body weight. when i look in the mirror i think how ugly i am. people tell me i am attractive but i do not believe them. i feel like my life is a failure. i graduate college with a degree in fine arts and history with honors...this is not good enough. i feel as if i am very ignorant and perceived as such. i am have traveled abroad three different ti ames...yet when others tell me about their travels i feel inadequate. my dreams and goals feel absolutely i ampossible. when ever i go out into public i think everyone hates me and is talking about me. i also constantly google mental i willness and symptoms because i am convinced something is majorly wrong with me...even though three doctors have told me i am normal . i take multiple mental health quizzes everyday to see if i have lost my mind. i am constantly asking my coworkers at work what they think about me. i am an artist and believe every work i produce is garbage. even with people validating me i usually do not believe them. any advice?	moderate
i really get it now currently sitting in a ball of dread and anxiety as i wait for my college is provost to decide my fate over being caught plagiarizing. ever since i got the email of accusation, i do not have the spirit to fight anymore. this feels like it is it. i fucked up, i sabotaged myself and now i have pretty much ruined any chance of getting into medical school. i do not want to move, i do not want to look at people, and i do not want to be alone with my thoughts. i do not know if i have enough to keep going on. everything looks hopeless. i thought i understood depression before, but this is a whole new level. when you re the one who put the gun to your head and ruined your own dreams it really hits differently. years of money and school wasted. hello rock bottom, mind if i stay awhile?	moderate
counselor at school calling my parents so i have had a few run ins with counselors in the past having to call my parents because i am depressed and every ti ame my parents have yelled at me saying i am just looking for attention and i have told them myself before that i have a few things wrong with me but they never believe me or tell me to get over it. my grades are basically all fs and i have been doing horribly lately so i talked to one of my teacher but he had to email my counselor and now she has to call them. i have given them a fake email before my moms old one that she lost the password to so i was thinking of telling them she got a new phone and giving them my friends phone number instead. if i do, wi will i get in trouble or wi will my parents find out? i really want to avoid them knowing anything.	moderate
complete thissatisfied human being. so i am a bit excited about doing a post about it. i am struggling from severe depression since i am . i am also not the one who is crying over things happened in the past. it is about my condition i have been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it. everyday i wake up with great thissatisfaction. always in a bad mood. no motivation at all. always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. i have lost interest in nearly everything drawing, music, singing... not knowing what to do, i fear the future ahead of me. i was once totally into design... thought this is what i am going to do. however, i have also lost the interest in it. it was a gradual change and i can not even explain why it happened since i was always passionate about it. now i am sitting there day by day everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. i feel like i fell into an abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. i do not know who i am neither am i satisfied with how the situation is not changing. i tried meditation once. it was a good experience. but i am not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation. do not get me wrong. i am really grateful for what i have. being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. i do not like it fancy. i just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again. does someone experienced the same? what did you do to get out of it?	moderate
i am really not okay. trigger warning verbal diarrhoea too it is a very long story but to shorten it a bit. i am getting kicked out of crisis housing for having my dog which they knew about, on the property. just going to state here that she was apart of my agreement because she is going to be a service dog for me. they have now changed there minds months later amp saying that i can stay but she can not. i am basically being forced to be homeless amp no one really seems to care. i have been reaching out to those i love... but nothing. all too busy or something better. i know they say do not give up, it wi will get there but when? for the past years i had cancer, after i found out i was in remission amp this program a youth organisation had accepted me, the australian bush fires started which effected my family home. i lost my granddad as well now they are doing this. just when is it going to end	moderate
suicidal thoughts multiple ti ames a day it is not a competition, i am not promoting it, but i have had one of the worst hours where i have been knocked down, felt suicidial, picked myself back up, got knocked down again, felt suicidal again, picked myself back up again, and then it is happened all again. i have actively thought about ki willing myself because of three different bad things that is happened in the last hours and right now it would be helpful to hear that others are also doing the same exhausting routine too.	moderate
nearly a year into my gender transition what i have learned. mtf i thought i escaped the depression. from the first dose of my spiro and estrogen i felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. it was ti ame to be myself and thrive. i enjoyed it. i no longer needed to hide. after a couple of months i thought i would try dating. of course, i expected the hate messages. i expected the slurs. what i never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after i thisclosed that i am transgender. what i soon found was a pattern. a pattern i could not escape. it was in this moment i realized what being a living fetish is like. for the past nine months i have been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a thiscreet fun ti ame. i sti will fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. the first few ti ames hurt my ego but i recovered. having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. i want nothing more than to just connect with someone. talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. but. the only attention i ever get are if i post naughty pics or nudes. once i show and indication that i am human they ghost. i have made a few trans friends and the story is the same. does not matter how pretty. how much they pass. we re just a fetish and nothing more. it makes sense why they are all either depressed or escorts. i have fought the desire to end it completely so i no longer have to deal with the loneliness. it is a crippling loneliness. i wi will never find love.	moderate
every once in a while i remember i am useless i feel like there are only three things that you absolutely can not be, dumb, ugly, and useless. i have gotten through life fairly well being able to somewhat accept the dumb and ugly part, i tried to blame it on other factors for a while but they are just an integral part of who i am. what i can not get passed is being useless and having no ski will whatsoever. i fall into all three categories and wish that i had just given up on life sooner.	moderate
passively suicidal so i think about death all the ti ame and regularly think about situations where i get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer it is so bizarre. because i am not actually a risk to myself, i am in way planning any attempt but as i fall asleep it seems like i am always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. i call passive suicidality living in the grey . it is an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. it is so strange because health professionals are always asking if i am having dark thoughts and it is like, well, what really is a dark thought? when it comes down to it, it is the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. death is always on my mind. not just my own, but anyone and everyone. i think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how i would grieve. would i crumple into a depressed mess of rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family? who would care if i died? so many questions all the ti ame. anyone else constantly have death on the brain?	moderate
forcing myself to appreciate my progress hi! i have been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer , currently on medication amp therapy. beating myself up every. single. day. for just being lazy , and not being able to get it together , as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody including the doctors into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep , wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do do and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. here it is most days, i am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower i could have given up on all work to kind of sleep through my depression my partner can support me financially with no trouble however as tempting as it is i sti will do the work working remotely from home and recently took on a big project, which i was debating declining but sti will did not no idea how and if i am going to handle it but i will update you on here roughly once a week i may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and i stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, thisturbing thoughts i have never missed a day of therapy even though my sleep schedule is non existence sleeping every hours during the course of a day i sti will pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour i think that is about it. i do feel better. wi will update on my progress.	moderate
seems like nothing that i try to do lasts or helps i have been going through a rough patch. i was recently diagnosed with mild depression and gad and have worry reduction group therapy in a few weeks. i do not feel like i have anyone to talk or turn to without feeling guilty or like i am making a meal out of how i am feeling. i try and help people who have more stressful things going on as a thistraction technique but i am now feeling like i should just stop messaging or contacting people because at least then, i wi will not feel guilty about bothering someone. i have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and i am sleeping less. i tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. i also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but did not notice much difference. i am at a bit of a stand sti will with regards of what to do. i am not too sure what to expect from writing this or if i wi will get anything out of it. but i think the anonymity of it helps a little.	moderate

i think this is my final straw and i am scared warning this is very long. i am not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. maybe i wi will get some advice, maybe someone wi will read it and realize they are not alone. i have started writing this so many ti ames and lost motivation half way through. this is yet another attempt, let us see what happens. i am a year old woman, i work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in graphic design, volunteer at a cat rescue days a week, and suffer from depression and social general anxiety thisorder. i first realized my teen angst was not just a phase someti ame in my early s. as a teenager i would do the normal things drink, do drugs, smoke weed. i would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. i have since lost that precious notebook, but i did come upon snippets of that poetry in my other sketchbooks. the stuff was not anything out of the ordinary i grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. i lost interest in that activity around the age of . i was always a shy person. i played with friends during school, but i was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone is house. as a result, i was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. my parents brought me to canada when i was years old in order to expand my options for education. i was born in russia where there was not much choice at the ti ame to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. in that aspect, i thank them. i was able to attend an art school in toronto and attain my graphic design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates. when i arrived in canada i did not speak much english and was in an esl program. in that first year, th grade, i was bullied for not speaking the language. some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks the little pebbles from the playground down my pants while we had carpet ti ame when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson. they knew i wouldn t say anything, partly because i could not physically, partly because i could not mentally. kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. i brushed it off, went on with it. i did have two great friends one of which is sti will in my life albeit we are not close. this chilthish bullying subsided after the first year. i went off to another school in grade after moving buildings with my parents. th grade was split. it was yet another school moving from elementary to middle school and then half way through th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, i was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. i had to start over with the friend thing and luckily i befriended a girl right away. she was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also did not fit in with the cool popular kids. here i was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having friend, and being so extremely shy. after a while i became close with another girl, let us call her jessica. th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. i was also developing extremely bad acne, so i was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years. ending of th grade is where the real trouble started with jessica. she had an in with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, i got to hang out with the group occasionally. this is where we started relationships with two boys. she was with lets call hi am andrew and i was with let us call hi am mike. we would hang out after school a lot and one day i brought them all over to my house. mike took me down to my parent is cellar at one point and where i thought i would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. i did not know how to retaliate so i went with it. instead of a first kiss, i gave my first hand job. the next ti ame we hung out was at the movies. i was brought to the bathroom for what i thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. i can not remember whether i went through with it, i just remember crying that evening. i soon found out that andrew and mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. these things bled into high school. the rumours started that i was a slut and were reinforced with photos being thistributed throughout the school. the photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun fashion night. she wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got thistributed. finally a new girl came to the school lets call her beth and finally things seemed to calm down. we had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school to the point where people were calling us lesbians. i even attended her wedding two years ago, she is a beautiful human being. i tried my best to have a normal life. i threw myself into art. i would come to school at in the morning so spend ti ame in the photography dark room lab. i got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. of course throughout this ti ame i did the regular teenage girl stuff. i liked boys, i would make out with them. i was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. i just did it. it made them happy. and in my mind, that made me good at it. why not do the thing that i felt i excelled at? of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. i first tried drugs in th grade. beth and i would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. this went on for about a year in the th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. i am not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but i managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. at the end of th grade i met lets call hi am sam. we dated for years, i lost my virginity to hi am, but i wi will always remember doubting his intentions. did he stay with me for the sex? did he only want me around because i would smoke weed with hi am? it did not matter. i lost romantic interest in hi am after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit i just did not want to, or could not break. i got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. after my break up with sam, i met lets call hi am dale. it was interesting at first. he would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. he brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. i now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. he wouldn t take no for an answer even if i did not really feel like doing anything. the thing with dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. we were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. i was starting to get really put off by hi am, but one night he insisted on hanging out. as you well know by now, i have trouble saying no. so we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. i know how shameful it is to drink and i drive. i know first hand because i almost ki willed my friend during a drunk driving episode. i have not done it since and wi will never do it again. we were in the car and i was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. but he wouldn t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. i did it just to make hi am shut up so i could go home. i have not seem hi am since them. i refused to talk to hi am and eventually had to block hi am. to this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. the truly destructive behaviour started around when i began to frequent parties. at first it was drinking, and a lot of it. then i met a year old man lets call hi am izack. he was a dj and very much into the rave party scene. it was with hi am when i tried coke for the first ti ame at the age of or . lets just call the rest a blur. i would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. long story short, i just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor is heart. i loved izack. he was older, had more experience, best sex i have ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. he lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. the sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. i would be able to spend all my ti ame there away from my strict russian parents. then izack started going on the road a lot more due to his dj career flourishing. when he was away, i would come to his place and clean everything. i bought hi am a huge new tv for his room. i wanted hi am to come home to a beautiful place. in my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with hi am rent free for so many days of the week. about a year into our relationship, i went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that i have an std. they told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. it was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pi wills but i had to have a serious conversation with izack. he swore on his life that he never cheated on me. he begged me to believe hi am which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, i finally did. but i never got over the nagging feeling that something was not right. so after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday i remember that day so clearly , i asked hi am one more ti ame. i am not sure what made hi am tell me truth this ti ame around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how i contracted the std. i was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. the drugs and alcohol increased. i went on tinder and began my first sex binge. at one point i managed to sleep with different men in one week. all i wanted to do was to forget the hurt and i did not know how. again, all of this is very blurry so i can not say the exact moment that izack came back into my life but he did. i remember going to a bar to meet hi am to get closure, to finally say i forgive hi am and that i am moving on. that meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. we then got back together , continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. i let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. i think this is where i learned how to numb my brain from hurt. i was not mad at hi am anymore, i just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on tinder. after a few months of this, i met a guy lets call hi am jon. we dated for something close to a year. this relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. but at this point i did not want another life. the relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. for example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking hi am why it took hi am hours to answer a text massage. i was told i was crazy on an almost daily basis. i wi will fast forward to the end, where a girl who is now a friend reached out to me saying that she was also dating jon, for months now. she spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. it turns out, that we weren t the only ones. i came to the knowledge that he had slept with different people during the span of being with me. this included his upstairs neighbour who i was constantly told not to worry about. i laughed at this. i did not cry, i did not feel angry, i laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next tinder binge i went. it took me about months to get into my next relationship. this one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. it lasted for about years. i met his parents and he met mine. we were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. we just weren t right for each other. so this is where i am now. years old, living back with my parents. i have since stopped the partying because that life does not satisfy me anymore and my body can not handle it. i have been coke free for about a year now mainly because i can not afford it. but i drink. i drink several ti ames a week because i can not stand my job. i drink because i feel trapped in my own mind. i drink because of my living situation. i drink because nothing i do excites me. i drink about ti ames a week and once i crack a bottle of wine, there is no way i can stop. that bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until i pass out. the job thing realized i am the only one who can help myself there so i have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just is not an option. i go to work, i laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that i took forward to is that next drink. i started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but i always fall off the boat because i can not stay excited and motivated. last night i came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and thisplayed in front of me by my dad. my mom thiscovered the first bottle in my closet when she could not find my cat, or so she says. she then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the or so i had hidden. long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and i am terrified. i feel like i have nothing happy to come home to. i spent all last night crying and today is the first day i did not show up to work because of this. the thing is i do not know if i want to stop. i have had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. i have cut myself on numerous occasions. i have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. i did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my mini amal salary. my dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer i am not sure i want to take. i just want it to be over. the only ti ames things are okay in my brain is when i am sleeping, or when i am heavily buzzed. i do not have children, nor a boyfriend and i have maybe friends, so i am finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. i would like to finish by saying how awful i feel about putting this out there. the amount of ti ames the word i is used is upsetting and selfish since i know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. like my parents have pointed out numerous ti ames, i have nothing to be sad about. i have a good job, a warm house, food and water. i have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought hi amself a new one. and they are right. i have it so good. but inside, that dark cloud just would not lift and there is no way i can describe it in words to someone who has not felt the pull of it. thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. i am very scared and for some reason the only thing i thought of this morning was writing this.	moderate

i am tired of people thinking depression is just something you can get over within a short period of ti ame. talked to my mom today about a test i have today that i was stressing over. and the conversation turned into me wasting my potential all in love . but what pisses me off is this just get over it mentality like what is taking me so long. and her and i both know i have to get on top of things but when you had depression for years and counting this is not something you just overcome in a short period of ti ame. and probably what pisses me off the most is the fact she is right bc her and i both now ti ame does not wait for anyone. i do not have the luxury to keep performing at the level i am currently am. all of this is just frustrating, ik the answer it is just a matter of applying myself.	moderate
this world has no place for people like me. a bit of context. i am an american. i am black. i am big. i am ugly. and i am autistic. i work as an aircraft mechanic. the more i go through every day, the less i see the point of continuing with this life. no one who is gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. people make fun of my quirks all the ti ame they think they are being funny, but they are being obnoxious. besides that, the only friends i sti will have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. my father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while i was waiting on a connecting flight to visit hi am. besides that, people wi will only connect with me as much as they need to. i clearly have problems that i do not know how to address. no amount of therapy has fixed those issues. people cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. society here in general does not like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. i know that i would not ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because i am likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. i have been racially profiled many ti ames when i lived in new york city. i happened to be stopped for every random drug search whenever i took the staten island ferry while carrying a backpack. that being the case, the only value of any sort i can provide to society is in the job i do. i am also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day i am questioning more and more why i care. more money is not going to fix me as a person. the truth is, i am a mistake. i learned a few years ago that i was adopted at birth. probably before my new parents knew i would be as difficult as i was. i should have been aborted or left to die. the prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who do not give a shit about us. there is no reason to believe things wi will get better people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards. before long, i wi will have a gun. it wi will allow me to protect myself where i know law enforcement would not. but it wi will also give me the power to choose when i want to die. that, at the very least, wi will give me peace of mind knowing i have a way out whenever i need it. i am not some starving kid in africa or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are thiscontented, but i have sti will been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. i see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future wi will only get worse.	moderate

what is something that others can do to help a victi am of depression? as an individual who is friends with or have family members that suffer from depression, ive always wondered, what is something that can help depression that a therapist is lacking? from my personal experience, ive always heard that having a therapist to treat your depression can be helpful someti ames but many ti ames, from what i hear, the patient continues to suffer from depression. what is something that others can do to help a victi am of depression? from your personal experience, what do you believe could be extremely helpful when treating or helping those with depression? i am genuinely curious and eager for any feedback due to my desire of assisting others.	moderate

people are starting to ignore me and i feel isolated or like an outcast i feel as if people are ignoring me and what i say now. some of my friends have become really popular and whenever i say hi or call their name they either look at me like they do not know me or just flat out thisregard that i am even talking to them. barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. my crush has seen me at my desk when i am going through a rough ti ame but she just ignores me. she has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she does not care. one of my friends who i thought was my friend leaked out that i am autistic and have adhd as well as i take medications for that every day. now, whenever i walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. i have been called a mistake so many ti ames. all this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. this has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. i have been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. the people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than i was before this. i want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. i consider my friends family as well maybe their all right, maybe i really am just a mistake.	moderate
goodnight i want to live. i am a little, cheerful girl. i love music. whenever i am about to go to sleep, i take my pink mp player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while i amagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! as i dive into the blue sky i scream so loud that my throat hurts. maybe if i am loud enough i would not be able to hear my mother is epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what i have been reading and if school is going good. i try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. school is going good, i am really enjoying my art classes. the teacher says that i have some potential and that i am a pleasure to have in class. maybe because i rarely talk. i like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like i am special i think as i sit on my bed, with one of my cds playing in the background. i am in middle school. i live in the city now. my school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. it is always crowded yet somehow empty at the same ti ame. i no longer have art classes. my teachers say that i am smart but kind of lazy. all of the girls are so pretty. my cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. i skip my lunch. looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. i hate pe classes. i am the only girl that can not play volleyball. i hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. it hurts but i pretend nothing has happened. nobody notices. high school is scary. boys do not really like me. maybe because of the way i dress or because i cut my hair very short. starving becomes binging. i really hate my thighs. i am the class clown. i skip school every day for a week. i overdose on medication several ti ames. one ti ame i almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pi wills. i try to ki will myself. when in the er one of my teachers is there. she looks at me. i can barely stay awake. one of the nurses tells me that i am selfish. after coming back from hospital my teachers say that i am the laziest student they have ever had. my mother forces me to lie so they would not put me in a psychiatric facility. i go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. i have to ask to go to the bathroom. my mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. dinner tastes awful. i want to die. college starts. my major is not that great. i have literature classes. i am a very average student. someti ames i remember my elementary school art teacher. i feel like i failed her. boys sti will do not like me. my cheeks are sti will way too chubby. my body is covered in white thick lines. people stare a lot. some ask questions some just avoid me. i sti will i amagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t shirts, and old sweaters, i no longer am a superhero, now i am the one waiting for someone or something to save me. i no longer scream, i no longer put up a fight. i remember loving music but now it just gives me a headache. i am an almost year old, tired woman. i no longer want to live. goodnight.	moderate

getting pummeled from all sides i am drowning over here. i am failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and i do not know how to deal. my abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. he wi will be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he is never spent more than six hours with her. she is going to be so scared. she is too young to understand why her mom is not there. i have tried suggesting we transition slowly but he is refusing to do so unless i give hi am six more hours a week, in good faith. i have two weeks to pay dollars k to a court appointed person, that i did not ask for and can not get rid of, or i wi will be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail ti ame, even though i am unemployed for another couple months. my dad is well able to help, but would not, because he does not want to get involved, but not because he is not financially able. my boyfriend is completely mini amizing and demonizing my feelings. every single ti ame i point out a problem, he plays victi am and turns it around on me. when he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, i just need to toughen up and trust that he does not mean it. when i get upset that he tells me what to do, i just need to let go of this hatred for i amagined authority. when he is super stressed to the point of being negative all the ti ame and i am feeling neglected and unloved because of it, i just need to keep my feelings to myself because he does not need guilt on top of his stress. my baby has been sick so she has not been sleeping well. she woke up at this morning, when she normally gets up at , and i was trying to get her back down. well i also live with my parents. and my stepdad told my mom that i was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to inti amidate her, which is not at all true. when i told my boyfriend that i was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe i should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. so yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because i have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. let me change something i do not even feel i am doing wrong just to make someone else fucking happy. and if i am not happy? well, that is just too bad! because apparently everyone else is feelings matter but mine. i do not want to die, but i can not fucking live like this. every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. it is putting everyone else above me because if i do not, i wi will be chastised or belittled or berated. no one can just let me be me and do what i do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what i do and say and think and feel. i can not fucking live like this. who fucking can? but there is no way out. i am unemployed until the summer. so i have to live with my parents. i have to listen to their bullshit. i can not get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. the court is refusing to hold hi am accountable. i can not force my dad to keep me out of jail for something i have zero control over. i can not get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but i can not break up with hi am either because then i wi will completely fall apart. those good moments with hi am are literally the only things keeping me functioning. i honestly feel like if i did not have skin, i would be shattered. not even just shattered, in pieces. like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they are i ampossible to count, and i get cut by them every single ti ame i move. just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments. and there is zero way out. i have never felt so hopeless in my life.	moderate

pregnant and depressed. my husband and i got into a fight today because we are dollars short for bi wills. i took a week vto because i could tell i was becoming depressed and it was not going to let up anyti ame soon. i opened up to my husband and told hi am how sad i was, only for hi am to yell at me today and tell me that it is basically my fault we are not able to pay the bi wills. he told me that someti ames in life you need to suck it up and deal with it, when a few days ago he seemed very supportive of me and wanted me to be happy, he even tried to motivate me to go back to work just in case it was about my job and not my feelings. i feel betrayed because i told hi am that the only thing that makes me feel better right now is being home with hi am because i love hi am and now i feel like he does not care about how i feel. he called me a spoiled princess and told me that it is my fault for being off work that we can not pay our bi wills and that i am neglecting a job that pays well and told me that i just do not care, that i am why he stresses out every month that we can not pay bi wills, even though this is the first ti ame in a long ti ame that we have gotten to the point of this. he is called out every monday out of the days he works to go to interviews for jobs he did not even take, which costed us more money in gas when he could have gone to his work across the street. i did not know that me being sad was going to lead to hi am treating me this way. maybe i am in the wrong, i do not know. i tried talking to my mom and she said the same thing, that i have not been to work so my husband is not far off from the truth. i feel like shit, i wish people could understand what i am feeling. i have never been successfully pregnant before, my last two ended in miscarriage at about weeks. i am now weeks along with the most healthy pregnancy i have ever had, i have never had to deal with the mental stress and depression that comes with it, even when it strikes for no reason. i feel like i fucked up by sharing my feelings, i definitely do not want to share them again. maybe he was right, i should have just sucked it up and gone to work. my job consists of dealing with pretty rude people on the phone who usually almost every day insult the shit out of me because they are upset with the company. it is a lot to deal with mentally so i figured for the health of our child since there are studies on how mothers emotions affect the fetus , that i would put myself in an emotionally stable spot where i wouldn t be dealing with being insulted and told that i am bad at my job by customers who are already irate. maybe i deserve to feel this way.	moderate

what the hell is wrong with me i need help... i just moved into my first apartment of my own at almost years old granted it is section housing paid for largely if not mostly by the state specifically for people w thisabilities but that is beside the point... anyway , i have got a big problem and i do not know how to get over it. i should point out that i have probably posted here before in preparation for this move it took months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar.....if that bothers you, just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with trolling . sorry, i got a bit off topic there for a minute. my problem is that i basically just sit in my apartment all day watching t.v. or playing games. i have met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when i first moved in just to introduce myself and say hi which took a lot of courage for me as i have got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone. at any rate, so far i have met or at least casually said hi and at ti ames attempted to start a conversation with to a handful of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program i am signed up for or in the hallways. but i frankly can not find pretty much anyone i want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. there was one guy that i liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted and that is coming from an uber introvert lol or something like that he did not even want to offer up his name. having said that, here is my real problem and likely the point where you all start to hate me lol smh . i am admittedly somewhat bigoted if you wi will against pwd persons w thisabilities for those unfamiliar with the acronym . a self hating pwd , if you wi will. it is not that i find anything inherently wrong or bad with pwd, so much as it is i am so fucking god damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing but a pwd, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend ti ame with one another, because normal for lack of a better, more p.c. term society does not want anything to do with us and god forbid they actually want to make friends with us or spend ti ame with us. . i wi will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually significan notly below my level or they have some sort of speech i ampedi ament probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain is ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, i am not an expert on those thisabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it does severely i ampact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. i quite si amply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who does not have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with kitties true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats or to try to thiscern what someone is saying every ti ame they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so i ampaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. that is like well over of the people i have come across so far. and the ones who are not i ampaired in those ways that i have met so far, are either significan notly older than me this apartment is average age i would say is well over and i am not yet or we just have nothing in common as i am obsessed with sports and movies and t.v. and i have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. note sorry i should have tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but could not figure out a good way to do so . now, mind you i know damn well that my inherent biases and super anti social tendencies are playing a big? part here, but i just can not bring myself to find anybody here who i want to get to know or hang out with. for that matter, none of the people i have introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say hi in passing me in the hallways. i have thought about trying to find a way to get involved in the community outside of the building, but between my anti social tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem i have with it, is there is basically only about a hour window maxi amum that i want to fi will during the dayti ame hours roughly ish to ish, my shows start at .....including transportation, which having to rely on para transit , means i could spend most of that ti ame waiting . and even that ti ame i could probably spend catching up with shows i have missed that i want to see on demand. basically, as has been the case for as long as i can remember, i am a t.v. and computer addict and i am largely okay with it, except i know it is unhealthy and antisocial. ideally, i would like to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly i do not seem to want to get to know and they have certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we do not have much in common, and she is already admitted that i am a dick which i already knew so i was not offended, the idea is less than appetizing. note thankfully, she does not seem to mind that i am a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one ti ame and i never got her apartment number and i have not seen her since . so to make a long story short how do i get over my fears, and out of my funk, while sti will maintaining the things i enjoy like surfing the net and binge ing on t.v. ? i am thinking about volunteering, but the last ti ame i tried before i moved i seem to remember those places always want you to volunteer understandably, for a lot more hours than i am wi willing to commit to. i wi will end by saying if anyone is even stil reading this tl dr post at this point, that there is no need to point out any sort of self sabotaging or excuse making on my point. i am well aware i do all of that, and i just can not get past it....in which case i am afraid i am screwed until i am able to do so.	moderate
need advice help please hello r depression, i am m and this is my first post here also sorry for bad english i have been experiencing lately some kind of weird realisation that everything good i do is just to seek attention and to be viewed as the best one and bla bla shit like that.... and fuck this shit is ki willing me, like every ti ame i say the right answer to the teacher it hits me, that all of this is just to seek attention. and i hate it. so i tried to just stay quiet in the class so even if i know the right answer then it hits me again that, staying quite just to be looked at like deep dope person. i do not know what to do , how to feel ,anything. and recently i started to get suicidal toughs.... also i have this weird voice in my head that replicate others appreciation of me , i just wanted it to stop, i do not care about other. this caused me to start to be an asshole to people, to cut any form of contact with anybody. to be hated. as i said i do not know what to do, how to feel i just wanted to start to feel normal and not thinking about what others thinks about me every damn second. again sorry for bad english.	moderate

guilt over my depression and moments of happiness. i feel as if i am selfish for seeking out help or talking about my issues because it feels others have it far worse than i do and by taking that attention they are losing it. i feel guilty for feeling the way i do because it seems as if my life is not as hard as it could be and i beat myself up when i do recognise i am feeling happier as i am not feeling this regularly. i am not sure how to rationalise these thoughts or if they irrational in the first place.	moderate
tears are all i have left well, i am about to go to work, and it is ti ame to cry in order to be able to cope through the shift and not show anyone my inner pain and appear happy. crying has become my only solace in life. i love crying. it is like a prayer to god and a way of hugging myself. it is like my soul finally being able to breath and speak. it is all i have that comforts me. no one knows me or sees me or understands me for who i am. no one comprehends the pain i have gone through and continue to go through everyday. i help others all the ti ame and show love and compassion. who wi will help or save me now? people are so judgemental. why can not we just love one another and do what is right and avoid what is wrong? people are so proud they do not see anyone who suffers and they treat others like dirt. we are all gods children right? why can not we have compassion for one another and stop abusing each other, mocking others and being cruel? anyways, just wanted to write that.	moderate

i am tired of fighting i have spent years fighting against depression, ptsd, generalised anxiety thisorder and an eating thisorder. i have had support from the local mental health team done tons of therapy throughout the years. medication the lot. but i sti will think of ending my life everyday. someti ames it is less intense and other ti ames it is highly intense. i have stopped talking to any family about how i feel because i get comments a lot if i do about how to effects them. although i have a complex diagnosis i am not a person who creates toxic environments for them. it is almost as if my very existence is a reminder that they failed me as a child to protect me. i do understand it must be really hard for them. they are the only reason i havnt fully gone through with a suicide attempt because i wouldn t want to break my mums heart i know she would blame herself but i am getting to the end of my s and i am incredibly tired or feeling this way. when i try and do something just for myself it upsets someone in the family for example if i say i am going to go out with my brother who is around my own age to go watch a band or thistract myself by other siblings who chose to have families say oh you never want to spend ti ame with me it is like nothing i do is right. i feel like i am living for everybody else but what i really want is to just not live. i feel incredibly stuck in life i live in a box room can not afford to move out. i just stay in my room of the ti ame every night i say to myself stay in the moment be mindful tomorrow is a new day. but when i wake up it is the same feelings. sorry if this is not appropriate or it is not very clear. i guess i just needed to tell someone.	moderate
i have been trying my whole life to not be what my parents are and get out of the cycle and system i have been put through and i am back again with my own family. i hated growing up going to the court house all the ti ame. i would attribute all the constant fighting and back and forth to a majority of what i deal with today not being able to find joy in anything and constantly lying about happiness and pushing everyone away. i swore on my life to this day i would never put any children i have through this and yet i am struggling to find my own ti ame with hi am that does not involve struggling and arguing with my bm everyday. i just wanted a family and i am slowing losing my sanity and everyone around me. i do not expect advice or anyone to really have much to say i have always tried to find a way out of this or see the good in it. it is just getting so much lately. this weight on my chest is so heavy lately i feel like crying everyday and if i am not crying i am held up in my room. i am and everyone tells me that it is only beginning and everything can get better but i do not know if i can anymore.	moderate
not really sure what to say kinda new to this so i am not super good at being open, but lately it is hard to go through a hour, especially at work without some form of crying spell. since where i am at the cost of getting a therapy session in takes for ever, or they want to charge a arm and a leg. which i dont have since struggling with money since i am the only that works currently in the family. figured i would try anything at this point since even though it is legal in my current state i do not want to rely on drugs for a crutch. i know they work wonders on people and people swear by it, its just not for me. then i have gone cold turkey with alchol since i figured in this current state that also wasnt the best idea to keep it in the house. so i have been sober since last october, but the longer i live here the harder it is for me. like it is hard to explain since in my mind, i know people are going through this with me and there are people who have it worse then me. that all dosnt seem to matter though and i can not shake it off me. i have been kinda slowly i am depressed over the last years, and it just gets harder each day, there are some good days though. even some good weeks like went down south to look at houses, and for the week and a half i didnt have any kinda crying spell or anything. felt like me and it was great, then came back up here and it is been really rough on me. the mood swings have been worse and i have been thistancing myself from my wife, and closing myself off to the outside. all i can do is just watch and i feel helpless to do anything about it, minus just cry which i have been doing for the past hour in my office toilet. then got to thinking maybe there is a reddit where i can kinda just talk, even if it is to myself for a little bit. i really dont know much coping ski wills or even methods. which i have been looking into, and take some cbd gummies even though they dont really do much for me i feel. i am just trying anything really to get over this hump and find the path back to feeling like me. so figured maybe this could be therapeutic maybe i am not really sure. i also dont feel hate or anything like that, like it is just feeling numb at ti ames, and feeling like i am alone even if my wife is litterly a finger away from me. i guess some of it could be contributed to my first parrot, which was given to my by now wife like years ago at this point. which unfortunately she died after the move due to stress and complications of it. then i got another bird after some ti ame of grieving since birds make me happy and what not. she unfortunately died due to stress after our basement flooded. that could be a huge factor to how i feel up here. i am not sure but thanks for listening and i hope all have a great day.	moderate
what do you do when you feel empty as a plastic bottle, with motivation to even get a glass of water, crying without a reason and wanting to just end it all? for all my life the thing that i have always wanted to do is to stab myself in the chest and just see what happens when i die. all the things i liked doing, i dont enjoy anymore. i think all my friends hold a grudge against me, and i do not know what for. in person it would take you some telepathy to really see that there is something wrong with me. i have learnt to hide, as we all have. it has not been day or weeks or few months that i have had those kind of thoughts. everyone i know has or is talking behind my back, i have heard rumours that i smoke, drink, use drugs, take steroids and a handfull of things that i can not begin to explain. i am only , my middle school was nothing but me being bullied or made fun off, being used or treated as trash. in high school i had a crush on a girl from my class, we were texting, getting to know each other and stuff.... just how much do i regret ever noticing that this human being even existed, if i could go back and just skip the part with her it would be the best thing. my home aint a better place either, father is a drinker, sister is a little brat, my mother struggles to make ends meet since my father is a piece of shit, so i do my best to help with whatever i can. i am grateful that i have a bed to sleep in, though it aint always warm.. i am great i have food on the table. i am ashamed of how my home looks so i never have invited someone over. solitude is all i know, i have become to be uncomfortable around other people, just because i fear someone would pierce or see thru the shell of the cool and chi will dude that makes everybody laugh, and wi will see what a mess he is when he gets a little privacy. i am sitting in bed listening to sad songs crying my eyes out for no reason at all, i am really thinking about ending it all tonight. tho i wonder wi will someone beside my mom and sister care that i wi will be dead? my abscense wi will not make a difference in anyone is life at all. would anyone even care at all. my existence doesnt matter at all, and if that is the case why should it continue, why not end it tonight. i have promised my mother not to ki will myself, but it is really hard to keep the promise. have you felt like that? how have you resisted the urge to just end it all?	moderate
i am afraid i am going emotionally numb and i am over compensating for it. i have been pushing people away in anticipation of abandonment. but the minute somebody is nice to me about my issues, i cling to them with all my might and forget boundaries. i hope for too much and end up thisappointed and what is worse is that i know i have no right to expect too much out of anybody. but somebody close to me told me i could talk whenever i wanted and when i tried, they responded in ways that shattered me. i was told i am pitying myself too much. at other ti ames, i tried to talk and they told me they were busy and that has begun making me feel guilty about burdening people who obviously have far more i amportant things to do. even after all this, i cling to them shamelessly. i cling to them because i feel like the minute i let go, i am going to end up completely and utterly lonely. i would rather be a pain to them than be alone with my thoughts because i am afraid. i have been called selfish and shameless and i remember feeling nothing about it. nothing but a void in my chest that was making its presence felt with a strong pull. i am scared of going numb. i do not want to stop feeling. but somehow this shamelessness and lack of emotions make me think i am there already. and here i am, trying to feel relevant on the internet because the people in my life are sick of what a zombie i have become.	moderate
when you know no one wi will miss you when you re gone hi, first ti ame user here. i have read post before i finally worked my way to making an account, and wanted to let this out. been depressed almost yrs. looking back, i was never close to anyone to speak about being suicidal. the few the knew about it, did not seem to take me seriously. only child, moved a lot between schools, so my friendships never lasted. plus my parents were very strict, so i could not visit any of them anyways, nor were they allowed to come over. shitty childhood teenage life. been in relationships where my kindness was used, been cheated on, those i was infatuated with never seen me the same way. i would always think i am the problem or the reason things never work out. i am not worth fighting for or keeping for the long run. i always thought i would die before i am . i am . i sti will feel strongly about leaving this place. i wish i can just sleep and then just shut down completely. just die peacefully. sadly life does not work that way, because ya know, life is not fair. knowing when i die, no one would know. it is pretty sad honestly, i want to be missed or at least know i was relevant. i was never someone is priority or first choice, not even from my parents.	moderate
a relapse i had a major depressive episode that lasted almost a whole fucking year and a few months ago i felt so sure that the nightmare ended and that i could finally start living a normal life.i did feel so much better.i started going to a therapist and working on my issues .i managed to stay focused and do really well at school .i started feeling a lot more confident in myself and i even felt real happiness . i was in a really good place for about months .i was so sure that i would never feel the way i felt when i had a major depressive episode again ,that i would not fall back into that dark pit .and i was so proud of myself for overcoming depression. and then ,a month ago,some shitty things happened to me.it made me feel powerless ,helpless .i could not come to terms with the fact that something so completely out of my control happened to me.and even though i promised to myself that i wouldn t let that shit interfere with the progress i was making ,it did interfere.i just could not help it .the damage was not done overnight .it was bringing me down slowly ,day by day . at first, i thought i was doing just fine.but then i caught myself having persistent thoughts that once made me decide to take my own life .then i found myself having difficulty concentrating on my studies ,even though i absolutely love studying and learning new things .then i started sleeping too much because the incessant flow of thoughts and overthinking made me feel exhausted .the headaches started.getting out of bed was becoming more and more difficult.and at a certain point i was so overwhelmed by my feelings that i just literally turned my emotions off .i did not feel anything .i felt numb and empty.i guess i kind of felt like i had to resort to turning the emotions off because keeping up an act of being ok with all the thoughts eating away at me all the ti ame was difficult as hell.my mom started noticing that i was skipping school and staying in my bed all day instead .i could tell she was afraid that i was in a really dark place again.and i just could not put her through that pain again.she suffered enough because of me.so i numbed my feeling and started attending school regularly .the whole numbing my emotions thing was working out just fine for me.i went to school .i did not think about anything ,i did not feel anything ,it is like i was there but my mind was somewhere else . i tried to put a smile on whenever my mom was around . obviously i could not keep escaping from my own thoughts forever .this would have been way too easy to be true . a few day is ago all the thoughts i tried so hard to avoid just burst out and it feels so fucking overwhelming . i just can not believe that i am feeling all this shot again .i was so sure that the nightmare had ended . i doubt someone finished reading this because it came out way too longer than i expected ,but anyways i just wanted to share this with someone because there is literally nobody i can talk to.i just needed to get this out of my system. whoever is reading this ,i hope that you ll find enough strength to keep going no matter what . thanks	moderate
it is like teachers got worse after being told i have anxiety and depression this is a bit of a post to get rid of my anger i talked to my school guidanc councilor and she told the principal that i was going to therapy for depression and anxiety. she told teachers to consider that when giving out to me for certain things. like i get really tired because of my mental i willness so i get snappy at teachers when they annoy me so they basically give me more of a chance or something. so i have cbas classroom based assessment they are basically small projects that go towards your junior certificate and i am really stressing over them because they give some percentage of my tests. so i was working on my computer turned off. i went to the teacher kinda panicked because i had days to finish i am finished now d and i needed computer to work i told hi am this and he sat me in a corner of the room and gave me paper and told me to work on i could not so just doodled on the paper and got lunch ti ame detention. this was maths. then in english i was sleeping after finishing my work. this teacher is usually really understanding. he came up to me slapped the table next to me and said if you want to sleep get out of my god damn class lemme see your work. showed hi am the work he told me it was about what he expected from a year old. i re write it he says it is terrible and that i need to do it for homework. next day i did more than he wanted me to do word essay expected and i done he says he could not read the writing and that i need to do it again i refused got kicked out of class had to go to the principal and she said i should work to his standards. a few other things happened but these are the worst.	moderate

i am not who i use to be but who i am is not good enough for me. a phrase muttered amongst my depressive writings that stems from many others said and written before. as most people on this subreddit do, i struggle with the overbearing idea of i am not good enough and the words themselves make me want to curl up and revert back into my old ways. but after therapy and many hard hitting perspective changes i have finally learned to look at my old self as a separate person and not who i am now. there is many areas i sti will struggle with that make me feel like less and that i use to try and convince myself i am that person. but never have i appreciated myself before recently and all that i have over come and wi will continue to. last night i was one of my lowest points ive had in years but there is finally a voice that says no that speaks through it all and knowing i have got that back in my life is enough to keep living for and working towards. it is in our nature to fear death, and to want to die is an unhealthy way of signaling you want change. not death. ki will the ego, not yourself.	moderate

you ever get asked the where do you see yourself in five years? question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because probably not alive is the knee jerk response? first off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway. what do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question? that i am indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that i am ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit? fuckin hell, man. undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person. i suppose i am the sloth suicidal. i have tip toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and i can not help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the ti ame. yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is well, do not be alive anymore , the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone i leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint i have for seeing myself out of my life. sounds rather counter intuitive, but i would rather my last thoughts be more you gave it a go, you re not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo and less hey, you re a tremendous asshole for this, i hope you know that. i can comfortably say i am not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but i genuinely feel like that is how i am going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit. do not even really know what i am trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this? like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can not make any sort of move? afterthought can not help but laugh that when driveling on in this post i look up at the browser tab and it says submit to depression fuckin a.	moderate
i am really close to the edge. when i die i am going to just be another statistic and fade into obscurity. it is not worth it to be here. i just wish i could be here to see the faces of all the people who made me miserable when i die. i hope they rot. i wi will be forgotten. i wi will be nothing but an empty vessel. it is so calming. i can not wait. home is where the hatred is by scott heron on repeat, that song is a masterpiece. i want to ki will myself, but for now i am going to take a long, long nap and hopefully the depression wi will subside and i can have a wi will to live again. hopefully.	moderate

life has been a roller coaster, and i do not know what to do i have had alot of this on my mind for a long ti ame. i just need somewhere to write it down and try to see if anyone understands. i have been through alot for only being and my years before age had alot of bad shit connected to it that i am not teady to talk about. at i finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and i taken by the state again and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. that alone was just a bad ti ame. he called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to ki will hi amself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that i caused it. fast forward months and i was told by my doctor that i have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. fine whatever its just to check on things and i was fine after a week of rest. all they did was clean up scar tissue. however i had just started highschool and was in a junior rotc program through the army. i was excited and wanted to make a difference that my pos father refused to. i loved this program it was my family and i made really good friends. i joined their shooting team and made it my goal. i got good, really good, too in the nation good . my coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father i had. i loved them and i felt safe with them. a year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. he had missed something and that is why i was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at , cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so i wouldn t loose the ability to walk. recovery for that was terrible. i could not walk, could not shoot, could not do much of anything. i gained probably pounds over my month recovery. i had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. it was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and i was finnally back with my family, could not do much but back. i remeber that night because it was one of the last ti ames i felt complete. i was invites to another party a week after but i had to turn it down, my leg was not ready and i just could not. i went to sleep early and woke up with over notifications. come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.i was shaken to my core. his back up driver was shit faced and ki willed hi am and it was all becuase i was not there. a month later i was at his funeral and we were able to give hi am a send off to be proud of, all i remember was crying. i had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. that excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. i was absolutely devastated. i could not function. both of my pi willars just died within a month of eachother. i threw myself into shooting and my coach. he was all the support i had left. fast forward months to the summer. my surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and i could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day i rolled my car down a foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. once i was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. my coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. i loved that man with everything i had. he was all i felt i had left. he ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff, they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. i was completely devistated, i didnt know what to do but luckily i had made one more friend that i could talk too. i got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. this guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to hi am. flashforward to last month. he is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. i know he is guilty and being a victi am of sexual abuse as a child i hate hi am for it. one of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend is daughter for years. here i am now in college across the state and i am beyond lost with no true direction to follow. i want to go home and live closer to my family, but i am engaged and she is from the same town i lived in. we both want to move but are not sure what to do. this is not for pity i just really needed to get this out, thank you in advance for any advice.	moderate
if i were my parents, i would be thisappointed in me my other siblings are either working in the job they have always wanted, or a good job in general. they are also living away from home, and dating engaged. my younger siblings have an idea about what they want to do. meanwhile i am , work in the same takeaway for years. i have no clue about what i want to do, other than die. that is the only thing i am certain about. i live at home, have not dated anyone or kissed anyone. i am incapable of social interaction, i do not even have an id, despite being this year because i do not have any friends to go out with. i wi will never amount to anything, and everyone knows it. i am dreading my st birthday because it wi will just hammer home the fact that i am wasting my life.	moderate
it is suffocating there is no way out. my mental health has been steadily declining for.. , days now? today i almost had a pretty bad anxiety attack in school because of how i pissed off my friend like an asshole. i think i made her cry, probably. i just want to push everyone away. they do not even care anymore. i cry for help so much it is like i am crying wolf. they do not fucking care, man. my friends do not care. i am just going to push them away. nothing feels worth energy anymore. i feel like i am drowning. i have not felt this way in months, i have not thought of hurting myself in months, but here we are. i am tired of trying to fucking float. it is like the water is up to my mouth now as i am struggling to look over it, the dark dark black sludge of water is on the verge of drowning me and all i can do is sit here and wait for my death because i do not have any help to get out or any energy to get out myself. i am not strong enough for daily life. everything trivial just fucking tears away at me. i am such a piece of shit. i deserve to be in pain, oh god. i want to drink	moderate
ending suicidal thoughts i have been having suicidal thoughts every day for about five years. i thought i would get better but that seems increasingly unlikely as ti ame progresses. i would like to have advice from someone who had severe suicidal desires for a long ti ame but then overcame them. how did you do it? what worked for you?	moderate
this is very long but i have to get it off my chest i would always been a chubby kid. when i was young it was cute but as i got older it become a visual problem. i was never so chubby that it caused health problems for me. but visually however it did. soon my parents and family started to put pressure on me to loose weight. i had always being ok with my appearance but as ti ame grew and my family told me to loose weight more and more often i started to hate my body and the way that i looked. around this ti ame i started getting anxiety and stress. all of this combined and resulted in depression. i was very unhappy and struggled with myself. as i hit th grade appearance started to matter more and more and the pressure i got from my parents exponentially increased. i continued in a state of depression with very little friends, hate for myself and a struggle to trust others. although i was struggling with anxiety stress and depression i told no one not even my family and kept my struggles a secret worried that if my family knew they would blame it on themselves. during second semester of th grade i began to form a solid friend group of people who liked me with no regard to my weight. even though these people are amazing people there was a clear boundary between the skinny people in the group and me. they all liked me as a friend but no one had a crush on me because i was fat. this made my already low self esteem very low. throughout this the pressure from my family continued. and you may be wondering by now why did i not loose weight? well that is because eating food gave me the same satisfaction and lift out of sadness that self harm gives to others. it was coping mechanism and my cause of depression. it is a vicious cycle. i was determined to keep my depression a secret because by now it was clear that one of the main causes was my family is pressure to be skinny and i did not want my family to feel guilty. i entered into th and everything hit me like a bus. i started loosing the wall i had built around myself and people started constantly asking if i was ok. fat jokes were also common although none were meant to be directed at me they sti will affected me. my family is pressure to loose weight along with the school events led me to a deep depression that forced me into overeating and i ampulsively eating. finally i got tired of that and asked my parents to not pressure for months and let me loose weight on my own. they did not. they did not understand the fact that they were looking out for me was causing me to hate myself and loose all motivation to be skinnier. they yelled at me and screamed and me daily for not loosing weight and now i do not know what to do. they would not listen to pain and rnt making an effort to let me loose weight on my own. they r also foreign and do not understand things like depression or anxiety and are also very strict. along with the weight thing i am also experiencing difficulties in academics and experiencing struggles with freindship. i find my self crying my self to sleep everyday and i do not know what to do or who to talk to. this is the first ti ame i have ever said this and even if no one can help it feels good to get it off my chest after long years.	moderate
struggling to keep breathing. i am not sure even where to begin. i am trying to work through it, through the thoughts, the urges...honestly it does not seem worth it anymore to be here. i love when people say you have so much to live for! as if they know what goes on behind closed doors. they do not. i am on medication, go to therapy, the whole nine. nothing seems to really help. of course i have my highs and lows. but, recently, its been a lot of lows. it is crazy how people tell you they care or wi will always be there for you and then it becomes too much or too often. breathing is just becoming a struggle and i am not sure i can handle all that goes on inside. i feel like i am going to explode. just do not feel like i deserve to live. i am sure some would agree.	moderate

i regret i tried to be better so if i would quickly sum up my life i would say that it was just full of bad experiences and few good moments mostly when i was like to years old , and from that it has not been looking so good i am now , i did not sti will do not have many friends and my family does not care about me with exception of paying something for me from ti ame to ti ame not like i deserve anything from them anyway , so it is been like this for some ti ame but suddenly in last september i just started to feel better, i started to socialize more more or less unsuccessful but at least i tried , getting better grades at school and i even managed to find good friend, she became the only reason why i started to self i amprove and she was the only person that i could tell everything, because no matter what i told her she was the first person that actually listened to me and tried her very best to help me even at ti ames where i had mental breakdowns and i appreciate it so much , and so i thought i should treat her as best as i could, and i thought that maybe one day i would be brave enough to tell her what i actually feel to her that is that i love her more then anyone in my life , i managed that not exactly the way i i amagined it but sti will i did and so we sort started to build a relationship at least i think we did, honestly i do not understand relationships, so i am not really sure,and it was starting to look quite well, for example we went to a park few ti ames and we just sat there on one of the benches and just enjoyed a bit of peace in our busy lives, but then i think it was like in the end of january she told me that she does not feel the same way i feel about her, that really hit me, but i accepted it, because i sort of understood why she does not feel the same way, and so we have sti will been talking and going to the dance lessons that is actually where we met , but last weeks i feel like we re starting to get more and more thistant from each other, we do not chat so often as we did, we do not play videogames so often as we did, and i just feel like she does not like spending ti ame with me anymore for example today she left in the middle of a dance lesson, and i sti will do not know why , and i again i start to feel as bad as i felt before i met her, and i feel that if such a great person, like her, does not want to spend ti ame with me, nobody wi will. and so i do not know what to do, i feel powerless and i do not know if i ever find someone like her because so far no one but her made me feel like life really has a meaning. and so here i am now depressed, anxious and i do not know how is everything going to be and i fear i wi will again start to isolate myself and lose everyone who at least does not hate me, as i managed to do multiple ti ames in my life. so if anyone has some kind words or maybe even an advice for anything i would be very very grateful.	moderate

your parents not knowing how it feels to be depressed sucks ass when i was about my depression started it was not that bad like now but i never had the balls to tell them how i feel so i kept it a secret, recently i finally told them that i want to see a therapist, of course i had to call myself. now that they know that i am depressed they are sti will calling me lazy or saying that i do not do anything like they never thought why it is like that. it hurts so much to do even si ample activities especially when you are being forced to do them and when you can not you are called lazy.	moderate

retro active suffering? over the past three years my emotional and mental health have worsened. i have struggled with self harm, alchohol and a few other destructive habits. everyone around me was fine blaming this on a the passing of a close loved one, nice and si ample cause. but over the past three years i have slowly been suspecting that some of my character flaws and bad habits are not as si ample as what i initially thought they were. so maybe instead of being lazy stupid i sti will believe those are issues that i am working very hard on. maybe it has something to do with the intense spiraling fear i have of confrontation, anxiety, poor, very poor self i amage. basically it feels like as i have had depression anxiety trauma negative behavior patterns explained to me by friends media and cultural osmosis.... i ended up going huh, that clinical description of anxiety sounds a little familiar in a frightening sense. i do and feel things that sound insane when i describe them to myself. but at the ti ame i can not help but feel overwhelmed by these things. i wi will abuse physically and emotionally myself, feel swallowed by panic, fear and intense doubt just by a minor argument, or trying something new that wi will be good for me. i have never described myself as someone who struggles with depression as i was growing up. but i realize now that i hurt myself in so many ways not just physically. is it possible that i have always had these mal adjusted traits and i am just now learning to express them properly? sorry if this is stupid and rambling. i am not trying to clai am any undeserved attention. i know there are people with much more to struggle with. i am doing better the past few months. i have been working hard on my self and where i am at in life. i just worry someti ames i wi will always have these destructive tendencies inside me.	moderate
letting the clock tick by as i do nothing i am currently in transition to nee meds. soooo, i took a difficult course that was advised by several peers not to take because it is challenging. there is a project given two weeks ago and it is due in an hour and i tried to start it since am today and i could not figure it out. had a hard ti ame remembering the si amplest math rules, too which i have been using for years . and now i am just waiting it out. also, this week has been terrible i am general. so, depression is making me feel stupid and very slow but at this point i do not even know where depression started and where it ends. i do not know if i am just a lazy pos or it is the chemicals in my head. the thing is, i am not even stressed about it and i know i should be. no adrenaline kicked in and i just want to sleep.	moderate

please can someone tell me it is okay to ki will myself i just want one person to tell me it is okay. all i can picture is people who have met me being sad or wondering why. or talking about it being tragic or something. but no one who could understand. no one who would get that i would be better off dead. does no one else feel the pain? how are you supposed to live with it hurting like this every day? it never stops and i just want it to stop. i believe i wi will end up in a better place somehow, or maybe i could come back as like a cow or a dandelion or something. i do not know what happens next but it has to be better than this. the one person who knows how often i feel this way tells me i am wrong and that suicide can not be the right answer, but what else is there? death does not scare me....but living too much longer does. it is only going to get worse. and when i get to where it hurts too much, i just want to get out of it. i want someone to tell me it wi will be okay if i make this choice. i did not ask to be alive. i did not ask for the pain. i should be able to make it stop without hurting the people i love	moderate

i am just done life for me is a constant wave of failure. whenever i think things are looking up, thisaster strikes. i am just so stupid i would not ever be able to pull myself out, no matter the attitude i put on. the state is suing me for dollars k, garnishing my pay, i pay child support to a one night stand from over years ago. i did not graduate high school, i got my ged though. i have a gf who seems to just like me around because i accept her anger in my life. i smoke, i drink, i am just another peon at a job. nothing i have ever done has worked out for me long term, even though i have investing years in some things. i have given up on my dreams. i live in an apartment with no visible future of i amproving my living situation. i have a child due in august but can barely afford to survive. i compare myself to no one. i accidentally let my cat, my best friend out and he is been missing since october. i face the world with such a positive outlook typically and work so hard but nothing has ever works for me. here i am, broken, poor, and a monster. i just do not belong. this is barely scratching the surface i am ready. there is nothing for me in this world. it is almost too late. i give myself one, two days tops. unless i see a miracle soon, i am done. can anyone write anything to lift my spirit before it is too late?	moderate
i do not know how to express this... i do know that i do not like this the past months it got pretty bad. i was doing worse socially, academically and my mood just took a real dark turn. i was extremely pessi amistic and i was starting to turn actively suicidal but it was hard because i live with family. i spent a great handful of those days ready to die, i had a plan ready but i had to learn to drive which was stopping me. many of those days i just tried to avoid any contact. i just wanted to sulk and die. since yesterday i have started feeling better, my grandparents finally got back from mexico. today the counselor talked to me about my drastic change in grades with my dad, they told me if i ever needed help i could talk to them. i denied anything regarding mental health because i sti will feel like i deserve to die and also because i guess i just do not have the heart to admit it anyways. i am back to feeling the usual as far back as i remember. i guess it is nice hearing people expressing their generosity. maybe i am getting ahead of myself. i am starting to go desperate to escape all of that, i would sti will rather be dead but it is better.	moderate

i am not free i have been suffering from depression for a year now. every single day was so painful... but i was getting better lately. day after day, that sense of emptiness was ending. i was finally about to break free . no it was not true. i was just deluding myself and i understood it yesterday. yesterday was too painful for me. i had a void inside me and i had to constantly go to my room to shed a few tears. now, after what happened yesterday, i have lost hope. i am not going to be happy. come to think of it, i do not even have a goal now. it is almost as if you live in a soulless body. i have always made a huge smile in front of my family, but by now not even that comes out well. all day i have the same expression, with the same eyes. even when everyone is laughing, i remain with the same expression and try to cover my face, to not ruin the joyful atmosphere.	moderate

i am a normal year old girl. this is my story of my battle with depression. it is long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it. i am just a year old girl, with an amazing family. i have parents who have given me the world, and i am the oldest sibling of . i have had a great education all of my life, i went to an awesome university in my town but i had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. i live on the east coast, and i have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life i dream of living. i have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. nowadays though, the life i dream of living consists of these few things energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. at this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels i ampossible. i took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety i had was starting to take a toll. originally i had just planned to take a semester off because i wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. i did not want to be out for too long because i thought i wouldn t want to go back. but that was in september. it is now march, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because i am not in school and i am watching all of my peers live the life i had planned for myself, coupled with mental i willness, i have developed depression. at first my psychologist did not think i was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. luckily it is a bit better now. but the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. i also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. but now fast forward, i most certainly have depression. we are aware of this now. what i do not understand about depression, and never did until i was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. i used to think, how could you feel hopeless? there are so many beautiful things in this world. there are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. you have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it . but now, i understand. i truly understood the hopeless feeling when i started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even want to do them, and have a reason for them. my body feels like a rock that i am lugging around. i feel like i do not even have the capacity to think like i used to, yet somehow i sti will have all of the energy to overthink. but my creativity is stifled, i do not see the world as colorfully as i used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is sti will the gray winter we have had here for so long. i just do not have the energy for almost anything. and someti ames i wi will get myself going, but i do not feel as if i am doing my tasks or feeling things the way i used to. i do not feel full of life and wonder anymore. small moments do not bring me a boatload of joy. i used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it is always like i am searching for something bigger. which i know is not the issue here. it is just my brain. i drove to phi willy with a friend about weeks ago on a saturday just for fun, and i thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just did not. i was definitely fi willed with more enthusiasm than i usually was, but i could only keep that energy for so long. and once again, i did not feel how i used to feel before all of this hit. so, back to my original point. i feel hopeless. because how am i supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? i si amply just do not have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities i need and want to do. i know what is good for me, what should be good for me and making me happy. after all, it used to. but i am always tired in some way. i never feel well rested. i used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it is bad for my brain. i tell myself i should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. that my body is worth taking care of. but i am just so sick of forcing myself to do things. and then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. and then feeling totally hopeless. i do not want to accept that i am depressed. i do not even like saying i am depressed, and i hate it even more when people say it is not curable. how is not it curable? i did not have it my whole life. maybe the signs were there subtly, but if i knew about them, i could have done something before i hit this barrier. my family has done everything for me and i love them so much. i really do. i absolutely love my parents. my mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. my dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. my siblings all have minds of their own, too. my sister is adventurous and creative like me. my brothers are, well, my brothers. haha. my grandma is an absolute saint. but a lot of the ti ame, especially recently, it is hard not to thistance myself from my parents when i feel so down. i just feel like the thisappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. everything is always about what i am not doing, and i know it is because they care and think me doing things wi will help, but it is just not that si ample. i get irritable, and this causes tension. i kind of isolate myself from them. not really, but i just do not initiate conversation with them. i feel awkward. i wi will fix this but it is just hard. somehow i hate admitting this because i never wanted to get to a place where i felt my significan not other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it is unhealthy my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. it would not be this way forever, but right now it is. maybe god, or the universe, or whoever, placed hi am in my life for a reason. he is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person i know. this kid reassured me everyday, just because he feels like it, of how much he loves me, how i make hi am the happiest kid in the world, how i brighten his days, how i make hi am laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. and to me, they are not cliches because i know he means them. he reassured me that he knows who i am outside of this depression. he loves me for me. and he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he wi will not leave my side. it blows my mind. i do not understand it, but man is it relieving. i can not even explain how much i love hi am. he just never gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. he lives an insanely well balanced life, good for hi am. he has perfect mental health, and i envy it but i am more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. honestly, he is been a saving grace some days. i want to get back in school as soon as possible. i want to know how to build myself back up so that i can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. i do not want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. i want myself back. i struggle so much with feelings of is this worth it? because is it? people would surely miss me, but what about me ? how am i supposed to live if i feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? i wish that i could go back in ti ame, and almost just watch my young self from afar. i was so happy go lucky. spunky. happy. i wish i could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. someti ames i get really scared because i have thoughts about dying. i do not want to die and i do not want to commit suicide but what if i become that way to escape the pain? and i go nuts? and i lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? i wouldn t wish depression upon anyone. if you read to here then thank you. and if you have any advice, i am dying to hear it. happy friday.	moderate
lost i have been really lost lately. a lot of hard life experiences happened and i feel like i have been completely drained of any bit of happiness i had. i have let myself get hurt over and over again by someone that i trusted and truly loved and cared for, and i just recently took back control on the situation and cut this person off to try to save myself and heal from everything. the problem is that at the moment, i feel worse than i did before i cut the person off. i feel empty, unmotivated, i am exhausted and this feeling of loneliness is becoming oppressive. i am i ammensely lucky to have one amazing friend that is been there for me and has been helping me out the most he could, but i am scared that one day i wi will just be too much, too sad which would cause hi am to leave. i know that things get better with ti ame, but everything is starting to be too overwhelming and i do not know what to do and or how to slowly get back on my feet. i want to be able to find back the happiness and energy that i once had.	moderate

depression made me hate art i used to love art. everyday, i would spend hours just drawing in my sketchbook. i looked forward to the evenings when i could just sit down and create. i loved trying new compositions, new designs, different color palettes, etc. now, i dread it. i dont care at all. everyti ame i try to draw, it just looks boring and uninspired. i dont have the drive to create anything new. all the colors i used to love,just feel so bland. whenever i look at other people is art for inspiration, i just become envious and angry at myself. i do not want to make anything. it all just seems so pointless. every pencilstroke is a reminder of how much of a failure i am.	moderate
late night depression am i asking for too much? so here am i, doing my very first post, which i have never expected to do. this post may have no dedicated purpose and if it violates any rules, i am sorry and i would i ammediately take it down. thought this would be a good place to let go of my struggles and depressive thoughts. i do not know where to start off. probably with myself? i am a years old male from switzerland. right now it is am here. when i was i became very heavily depressed and apathic due to a traumatic childhood, but also further traumas throughout my life made it worse. therapists did not notice it and prevention of any further psychological damage was quite late. i lived a toxic childhood, youth and young adulthood and noticed me being different when i burned out and everything i bottled up for years just bursted out of me, so i lost my sanity for quite a while and was put down in a mental hospital at this point my personality already manifested in a very self destructive way and it was diagnosed as a combined personality thisorder . mental hospitals made my symptoms worse and therapists struggled helping me to an extend where i have been told i can not help you. . i just recently came out of a very toxic and devastating relationship. where i finally managed to open up to my partner, who was years older than me. just to be lied and cheated on, which was, according to her, my fault. i used to get very aggressive in response and use that aggression to become a better version of myself, work out more thisciplined, study harder, work better. but at this point i am just exhausted. so much that i just stopped caring about anything. mental pain was not easy, but i knew i was alive nonetheless, i always had some shi ammer of hope no matter how bad my life was, no matter how many people i have lost and been betrayed by. but now i am here, in the middle of the night not knowing how i feel, i do not know if i feel good, if i feel bad or sad. the voices in my head are gone but at the same ti ame so very empty. i feel empty, nothing more, nothing less. pure darkness so deep you feel like you could fall down and never land on ground again. i struggle sleeping, because my mind wants to repeat the past and revisit negative feelings traumas over and over again. i do not just struggle trusting, i am even paranoid at this point. if a person is nice to me, i i ammediately expect this person to hurt me at some point. i do not want to feel alone anymore, i do not want to be alone no more. this is all i have wanted and expected from my partners. i have met this girl recently. very friendly, nice, beautiful and she understands me quite well. but i see her as a threat, to me, my soul, my shattered heart. something that could losen my sanity even more. as if she is the next to add more oil to the fire until it becomes an inferno, another crack into the wall until it breaks and falls apart. i have never had anyone in my life who was truely by my side. only people pretending to be. but now she is here, offering me help, and i am here, struggling to take it. this is not about her, more about something i noticed. i have never been offered an ear like this, it feels like somebody really means it this ti ame because she is been through si amilar problems and traumas in life. usually i would not have to react because i knew it was just a friendly gesture and not really meant to help. more of a noble act to add something more to their superior ego. today everything i bottled up the past few days, weeks, months and during my most recent relationship rocked down on my chest and the sadness struck upon me. i felt like i would go insane and would need somebody by my side, somebody understanding me from deep down their heart and giving me the feeling of not being alone. i thought about the offer she made. i said to myself this would be just what i would need right now , and was about to accept the offer, tell her that i would need her right now, that she should come by. but at this point it felt like my hand could not reach her, as if something is stopping me, blocking me, pulling me away. the more i wanted to do it, the more i tried to overcome it, the more it got painful, i felt like bones and muscles were breaking and twisting the closer i got to it. an incredible pain of my negative and darker sides, like dark hands pulling me away and whispering this is not what you want, what we want . and i did not. i have let go of it. pulled my hand away. and sat down, together with all my negativity just like a meet up, surrounded by my past and all the horrible pain i have been through before. staring at my wall in pure emptiness. thinking about it, i noticed asking for it made me feel selfish, egoistic. things i have been told in my past repeatedly by people i looked up to, until it got manifested in my mind, that asking for help is something for the weak, that it is egoistic to i ampose your very own burden on somebody else, to drag and pull down somebody else into your darkness, just because of their bright and shiny light. the reason why i hesitated, struggled and finally gave up on it. so i am sitting here, wondering is it okay to ask somebody else for help? . ofcourse people say it is okay to accept help from a person you love or who is close to you. but i also know that people like me, depressed and mentally i will ones, can be hard to handle. we can be complicated and contradictory because of our defense mechanisms. and i am wondering how much of a pain and burden i could be to someone as soon as i accept the offer of help. as if the person is about to get into an oath with me, a bond that letting go of has the condition of me getting hurt and thisappointed again. which i think i can not bear another ti ame, because i am exhausted. at the same ti ame, all i would need, want and appreciate, is what i always lacked, pure warmth of a person, that i feel is coming out of the heart, that calms me during this chaotic storm called life . there is this one particular thought that is bugging me, every single day, the past few years. something i always ask myself when i found myself deep down in my dark hole, isolated and thistanced from every human being. and it is louder than ever right now, echoing inside my empty shell. am i asking for too much?

pregnant and lonely i am not sure why i am posting here, as i do not do much on reddit and i am not sure anyone wi will even see this. but i am currently months pregnant and struggling with depression. i was taking medication before i got pregnant but stopped it when i found out. i live with the baby is father who was my boyfriend for almost years before i got pregnant. i say was because he and i are no longer together because of my struggle with depression. he told me i ruined this pregnancy for hi am and ruined his life because of how i have been feeling. he told me this should be a happy and exciting ti ame, that i should be positive and not depressed. this only adds to my guilt and shame. i struggle to get out of bed most days but i do go to work. when i come home i am met with silence and hostility. i usually end up going to bed before pm so i do not have to think about anything or face the fact that i am truly alone. we moved out of state shortly before getting pregnant so i have nobody besides hi am. i am so lonely, i do not know how i am going to make it through this. every day i wish it was all over. i just do not want to feel so alone anymore. i need a friend or someone to talk to.	moderate

i honestly would rather feel worthless than forgettable at this point. i would rather just feel like i have nothing to offer. that would at least explain why people keep forgetting about me and abandoning me like i never existed to them. it is so unbelievably frustrating to feel like you have so many feelings to express, so much love to give to someone, but to sti will just end up left behind like a meaningless waste of ti ame.	moderate
 trigger warning i am having an episode? i have not felt this way in so long but the thoughts came back today, and i want to literally slit my wrists into fucking shreds . i always think the thoughts are truly gone and then sporadic episodes like these make me so thisappointed in myself. i feel like a complete waste of space and wallow in self pity and sad songs for a few hours until the trigger dies. ironically i was just talking about how i felt better, and while i do not have depression anymore it sti will hides in corners and tiptoes and jump scares me when i least expect it. i want to cut all the ti ame but i do not have any blades and the urge is not so strong that i need to thank sol 	moderate
depressed over the most trivial stereotypical of things. i have absolutely no motivation to live, to work, to function day to day. this is probably a story that everyone on here has heard a mi willion ti ames over. but frankly, i do not know what to do anymore. i am at the point in my life where i have to determine what to do with my life. what career to pursue, what path to walk down with my life but honestly? i have no passions. i have no interests. i have nothing i want to do. and honestly, i am afraid of work. that sounds stupid i know. but it terrifies me. what if the job has a terrible work life balance? or maybe its a job with no room for progression, or maybe it is just boring. i have sat around for two years doing virtually nothing with my life while pursuing an associates degree. i barely passed any classes lets not forget that i have absolutely no support system. ever since high school i have no friends, no real anything. i just do not see the point. no friends, no future, no life. it might sound trivial, but i do not see a point of this life when i live in a consistent state of fear, anger, depression. hell, the other day when i was driving i thought about just driving into an oncoming lane, because it would be so much easier. reading this back over it sounds so ridiculous. so trivial. but, it is not like i have anyone else to vent to. so go ahead, tell me how much of an idiot i am. i am used to it.	moderate
i know exactly what i need to do to i amprove my situation but i am too depressed to do it my life is currently in a downward spiral. i can see the steps i would need to take to i amprove my situation, but i am too tired to do any of it. it is gotten to the point where i am so apathetic that i would not take tiny steps to help myself. i recently just let a deadline pass that would have helped me out because... i do not know. i just do not care even though i do. it is like i am watching my life happen around me. i am too tired do not care enough to be an active participant even though i feel invested in the outcome. i do not want to die or my life to fall apart but i do not know how i can do another years of this, let alone or . i do not even know for sure if this is depression or if it is something else because i do not have access to healthcare. i feel like i need medication to begin to get myself to a point where i can start helping myself, but i do not see that happening any ti ame soon. i just want to go to sleep and not wake up.	moderate
i have a bad crush, and it triggered a heavy downward spiral. i spiraled down hard today, and seeing as i do not really have anyone to talk to, i am going to post this here and hope it helps. here goes. it is about a girl, mostly. well, to back up just a bit, it is i amportant to note that i have severe, persistent, medication resistant depression. i have tried a handful of meds, and not only did they not even begin to help, but they all had side effects ranging from uncomfortable to severe. i started taking cbd oil, and that has actually helped a ton. i am not saying there is not a med that wi will work for me, but i have not found it yet. i have suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life. i am currently on thisability because of my conditions. so there is just a little background for ya. months ago, i started a program to become certified in a job in the healthcare field. it is taken me a long ti ame to get to this point. i quit my job, broke up with my girlfriend, and moved back in with my parents about and a half years ago. i decided i needed real help and that i needed to go back to school. i have been going to school very slowly and gradually built up to being able to handle a real work load. this past fall i was accepted into a program. the program completion is about years away. on the first day of the program, i met this girl. she was stunning. i am not going to give a ton of identifying detail in this post, but needless to say that i was i ammediately attracted to her. of course, i thought about asking her out, but, being the depressed person that i am, i i ammediately thought that she is out of my league. i also thought about the fact that if it does not go well, we wi will be stuck in the same classes, day in and day out, for the next years. i guess i was afraid that it would be unprofessional or awkward. two weeks go by before we see each other again and classes actually start. on the first day of class, she sat next to me and almost i ammediately teases me. now i am like, great. she is beautiful and witty. this sucks. over the next few days i come to find out that she is very intelligent, as well. she is kind she is fit she is an athlete she has a smile that makes me weak. it is honestly hard to look directly at her. this is a bit of a ramble. the point is that i developed a huge crush on her. and it has not gone away. i thought perhaps that it would be an infatuation that would fade over ti ame, but instead i find myself thinking about her constantly. i am typically an indecisive, hesitant person, in general. the idea of asking this girl out, though, was just too enormous. what if she rejects me? what if we go out on one or two dates and then she rejects me? what if we actually date for a decent amount of ti ame but then we break up and we re stuck in this program together? i do not want things to be awkward. i do not want the rumors and the drama and the appearance of unprofessional behavior. i do not want the thistraction from this very difficult program. when would i even find the ti ame to attempt such a relationship? there were just too many variables. after a while, though, those questions and concerns seemed to matter less and less. they were sti will there, but i started to come around to the idea that i needed to do something. i could not just have this crush and be in agony. i needed to act. i decided i would invite her out to hang out as friends, and if things went well, i would ask her out. not a bad idea, right? i would look for signals and see if we have a real connection outside of school. i saw her today at school. she came in and sat by me and another classmate, for no reason. she really just came in to hang out with us. she is done this several ti ames, and this is part of the reason that i think there might be something there. but is she coming in to see me or my classmate? or am i overthinking this? i am probably overthinking this. we were working together for a few hours, but she says she has to stop real quick and let her friend in to the building. she mentions it is a hi am. i i ammediately thought, oh no. she is going to bring in some tall, broad, stud of a smoke show, and she is going to show me what her type really is. i am a skinny guy. i am fit. i play sports. i have some decent muscle tone on my chest and abdomen, but i am skinny. i do not have big arms. i am about she is actually about the same height as me. she is quite tall , but i am not super tall. i weigh about . i am a skinny guy. it is something that has always bothered me about myself. so anyway, in walks this tall, broad, stud of a smoke show. fuck. my mind i ammediately went to a dark place. this guy is her type. i do not know why i ever thought i would be her type. she is tall and beautiful. she does not want to be with some scrawny guy that is not even taller than her. look at this fuckin guy. he is a fuckin linebacker. of course he is. oh awesome. hey what is up buddy? you re also being super charming and funny? cool. cool cool cool cool coooool. fuuuck. what was i even thinking? i finished up what i was doing and got the hell out of there. i did not say bye. i just snuck out. i then proceeded to kick my own ass all the way home. i have never been so thisgusted with myself. i would not go into my exact thinking, but it was some dark stuff, and it was a long drive home. when i got home, i i ammediately crawled into bed. i could not do anything. i could not get on the internet i could not watch a movie i could not sleep i could not eat i could not read a book i was in depression purgatory. i basically stayed in bed from the ti ame i got home until i eventually forced myself to eat, and now i am here. i am just so very down. i do not really have anyone to talk to. i have very few friends, and i do not think i can talk to any of them about this. i am alone.	moderate
lonely and empty inside hi guys, it is my first ti ame posting here or really talking about myself at all, as i am not an open person. i am a year old male who has never had a girlfriend, has social anxiety, depression, etc. how cliche. i moved from a small town in which i had lived my whole life to a big city a while ago, and while nervousness is to be expected, it is been two years now and it is only gotten worse. i go to work, come home, do nothing, sleep but not very well , and repeat. i purposefully avoid social situations, and while i am an introvert, i wish i was more outgoing. i overthink everything, yet have somehow managed to bottle every emotion i once had deep inside, to the point where i feel nothing most of the ti ame, except anxiety. i hardly ever know the date because weeks and someti ames months go by like nothing. i hardly ever live in the moment when i am out of the house, i am always zoning out, etc. when i am at home, i usually do not do anything, even things i used to enjoy. i wouldn t say my depression is major at the moment, but a lot of people in my family do have major depression and i do not want to see myself going down that route. i keep thinking if i go to a therapist i wi will just be laughed at and i am wasting their ti ame because my problems are not that bad, and as a result, i keep sinking deeper into what seems like a bottomless pit. sorry for the fucking paragraph, but i guess a few questions i have for people here does going to a therapist really help? i really have no one i can talk to about my feelings because i only have one friend, and he is not the person i would talk to about that and i hardly ever see hi am . also, do antidepressants actually work? i am admittedly very stubborn and would not even take otc pain medication unless something is really bad.	moderate
i am probably going to end it all... at one point or another. idk if anybody wi will read this but recently i have been in as state of perpetual melancholy. i have reflected on my life, my memories, my past in general. i miss when i was a kid before i was bullied. i miss being happy and looking up to my mom thinking she was the most beautiful woman i have seen. i miss seeing her close the door behind her as she left the room knowing that i am loved. it does not feel the same anymore, my relationship with her has deteriorated and every ti ame i try to love her it is like she does something that makes me cut myself and i try to push her away and away. i miss how i was able to see myself being happy forever. i am popular now so i do not get bullied and i am attractive so i am not called ugly anymore or get clowned at school. i have lots of friends people i talk to daily but are more like close acquaintances but i feel extremely lonely. the more ti ame passes and i reflect on how i may have had depression for a very long ti ame and suppressed it for so many years, possibly a decade if it is possible to start feeling that way at . i do not want to live anymore when most of my life has been fi willed with pain and redundancy. i tell myself you re never enough but at this point it is like a voice in my head that is not mine but is also my own thoughts at the same ti ame. if i weren t alive anymore i wouldn t feel and i wouldn t have to suffer any longer. no more late nights crying in bed. no more cutting my forearms. no more waiting for the blood to clot so i do not get blood all over my bed. no more of that sting that i feel when i take a shower and reminds me of the pain i go though on a daily basis. i would just be gone. i would finally be free and possibly even happy.	moderate
depression has made me good in some ways, but bad in others. a bit of context i am a mexican spanish kid, who left mexico in to go live in spain. those of you old enough might remember that during that ti ame there was this flu, sorta like the covid but that originated in mexico. obviously, being in the early stages of school kids bullied me and treated me like scum because of this and i ended up alone. the years passed and i always was the weird kid who nobody wanted to talk to and i ended up falling down into a deep depression that lasted years, from years old to . now comes the good part, depression made me resilient, it made me able to overcome bad situations fast and always look at the positive things in life and this is very very good. i have also matured a lot faster than the regular person would i had to, it was either maturing or ending up badly hurt and misunderstood. i am now, but i feel like my maturity is years ahead of anyone my age, and this has given me an advantage in most areas. obviously, depression also left me with scars, scars that i am sure everyone reading this little block of text shares with me, and i want all of you to know that you should never be ashamed of those scars wear them with pride because they are symbols of courage and strength. i am not talking about bodily scars, i am talking about the fear of abandonment that i feel when i start a relationship with someone, the constant feeling of being annoying that someti ames leads to loosing people, i am talking about that ringing in the back of your head that makes you always think people do not like you. this are things that we can all work on, and they make us who we are. the whole point of this is to let y all know that we should always look at the positive output in life. even if the darkest ti ames there wi will always be a little hope. every single one of you guys is a fighter, someone who can and wi will achieve anything. keep pushing, keep driving forward and things wi will get better. random ass spaniard.	moderate
my current depression i am a year old married man. i have been unemployed for months now. i have been stuck in the worst depression of my life with no motivation to find a job or source of education to move on to. my depression has ebbed and flowed since my teen years, but i have never felt as beaten up and worthless as i do this ti ame. my wife and i love each other, but we have not been inti amate for months now. i can not look her in the eyes without seeing how useless of a husband and provider i have been. i graduated university several years ago with a good for nothing bachelor is degree and i have worked in dead end jobs with low wages ever since. i sti will do not know what i want to do for a career. i have no formal education or relevant work experience to get a fulfi willing job with good pay. i have always been passionate about books, movies, tv shows, video games, and sports, but i can not find any enjoyment from them anymore. i have not had a good night is sleep in years, so i spend all day being half asleep. i can not get anything productive done or participate in activities with others since i feel like i am not playing with a full deck of cards. i spend every day lying around feeling hopeless. i have done some minor exercise which helps slightly. i have been losing weight which is good as i was overweight mainly due to my diet as i have no appetite anymore. for the first ti ame, i have scheduled an appointment with a therapist which is not for another . months as that was the soonest available ti ame slot. even with that on the horizon assuming it helps me , i sti will find it difficult to deal with the fact that my current reality wi will have to exist until then. i do not know what else to do. the list of things i need to get done keeps getting bigger as more life is sapped out of me. i am functioning each day with a sliver of the energy, motivation, brain power, and happiness that i know i am capable of. the past few months has gone by quicker than i ever thought possible with nothing to show from me. i have been a burden to my wife, i have been lying to family friends about my unemployment out of embarrassment, and every waking moment feels like torture. i can not see myself getting back into a regular day job, but i can not keep burning through my savings either. i see no bright path for me going forward or any way to attain happiness in life. depression is so overwhelmingly complex that i know i barely scratched the surface of my problems above, but at least this is something i can say i did today.	moderate
i can not do it anymore. i am just a teenager but i am miserable. i love this girl but i get way too nervous whenever i am about to make a move we re dating and i care about her so much but honestly i am so fucking paranoid all the ti ame. every little thing gets to me nowadays and i have family troubles at home. no one truly gives a fuck about me. maybe my girlfriend does but someti ames i feel like i love her more than she loves me. i want to end it so bad, i have a terrible feeling in my stomach every day of emptiness and sadness. if it weren t for her i would have ki willed myself by now. my friends ik wi will not care if anything happened to me they would move on after a day or two. i am positive that if i leave this earth no one wi will give a shit after my funeral. just another number to add to the list. i hate living i hate everything about myself i have nothing to keep me going really at all i just want to die. there is just one problem tho and it is that i can not do it. i do not have access to any guns, and everything else is too painful and i would never have the guts to do it any other way. all i would have to do with a gun is just pull the trigger which i am sure wouldn t be easy either but at least it is quick and i could end my suffering. i pray everyday for things to start turning around and i work hard in school and sports but nothing ever seems to work i want to die. i want to die and i want it so fucking bad.	moderate

it always gets better, okay? say it out loud, it always gets better. after reaching my deepest point i was not even consciously suicidal, i just lost the wi will to live and if my family did not force me to go to the emergency room then who knows what i would have done. i honestly do not know. i was even in denial about how bad i was but today i just had my first interview and within thirty minutes of leaving, i get a call back saying i got the job have to do a background check first but ik theres nothing bad in there thank god they do not drug test lmao. anyway, i did not come her to gloat, i just want to yall to know that no matter how unbelievable it may seem to get better, it sti will wi will get better. ofc theres the few who slip through the cracks and sadly go unnoticed. ofc i was put on zoloft and welbutrin which was the hand that pulled me up from rock bottom. at first i was not sure if what i was feeling was me? i had been someplace else for the past six years. i would have dreams about me in my room and i am pounding and screamjnf and i can tell my mom is on the other side but no one ever came to help me in my dream. i would feel the want, as terrifying as it is to hear my door open it is also a relief because someone came to me. i had been closed off emotionally for six years and i forgot who i was. it was so bad that i could not tell reality apart from shit that happened in my dreams. some fuxking inception shit right here. turns out my mom, two sisters, and i we re all victi ams of emotional abuse. my father is a narcissist. no wonder i could never answer people when they asked me why i was sad. the problem was right in front of me and i saw the damage he was doing. i wrote down this realization? i had in my notes before going to sleep. i wi will copy and paste realizations it is like we re a family of birds who have such strong, beautiful wings but the daddy bird clips our wings so we can not fly and tells us it is to keep us safe. naturally we believe it because daddy bird knows best, right? absolutely fuckjnf not lol for the first ti ame in so long i can think and be independent. he had manipulated us from the start and no one else saw it but my mom. my father even convinced me that my mom was crazy and that her whole family is kookie when he was the one with a fucked up family. his father ki willed my grandma because of how stressful her life was with hi am. i like to think that god saw that she was stuck and her only escape was to join hi am. i am like fuck can i come too? but that is a bad thought okay?! not okay ! yeah if anyone has questions i wi will elaborate but i need to finish typing this so i can make my vegetarian spaghetti since they put real ground beef in the sauce but it is fine whatever cool cool i wi will make my own sketty. in conclusion, i got my first interview and job. small victories. always open up to those you know you can trust. i know deep down everyone has one but the head noise tells you otherwise. i am happy, as si ample as that. and i am starting to fuck with my narc of a dad so he can get a taste of his own medicine. make hi am feel like the one losing his mind for once. i did not just jump to hating hi am hate is not even the right word, it is bad to hate okay! dont have hate in your heart i mourned the loss of my father or at least who i thought he was. thanks for coming to my ted talk i refuse to check for typos or poor grammar so suck a dick if it bothers you idc	moderate

nothing in my life has meaning i can not do anything in my life to make it better. especially when i come home from school and the antidepressants wear off, late at night when the house is quiet and i am alone with me and my thoughts, i truly want to die. my friends are not interesting anymore, if anything they are a bother, having to fix their schedules and my parents schedule so i do not make either of them upset, along with trying to juggle my own sanity. my friends see me as outgoing, but right now all i want to do is cry here and forget everything. the only thing stopping me from going to the cabinet right now and taking too many pi wills is the thought of my friends waking up and seeing me dead on the couch, without any idea of what happened. i am so fake it ki wills me that i can be so happy and yet so depressed. i hate myself so much. i do not even care anymore honestly, i can not open up to anyone as they always shut me down, especially my one friend, who constantly complains about football, his girlfriend, grades, anything and everything to try and get attention. you re the reason i am at the brink of suicide, i hope you know that i hate you. you threw my wallet in the street and told me to go get it and did not give a damn. you re the person i hope learns that just because you re brother is nice and smart, does not mean you are. honestly i suck at fucking everything, nothing ever works out, no one cares. ever. i am trying to help everyone with their problems, and all i get is a spit in the face, me being accused of trying to get with your girlfriend, and a drunk faceti ame of you blaming me for our project. i hate you, you deserve nothing. i hope you know that me and you can both go burn in hell.	moderate

i am so tired of being sad. my job told me my performance was getting terrible, and i eventually broke down in front of my boss and told them i struggle with depression. my depression has been so bad lately and it has started to interfere with work, so i understand why they had to talk to me. i just hate i can not live a normal life. i try so hard to focus and concentrate but someti ames my brain would not let me. i am in therapy now and on medication so i am hoping to be better soon, i just wish i did not have to thisclose this to my job. i wanted to pretend to be normal but every day it was getting harder to do so. i did not want to seem like i was not trying, because i really was. my boss was understanding and offered to help in anyway they can, but i can not help but worry that now they view me as a weak employee and wi will somehow want to fire me. i am trying my hardest to be okay and it is so hard. i wish other people could truly understand what it is like to deal with all of this inside your own head. do not really know why i am writing this, i just feel so weak and embarrassed to have had to explain this at my job. i guess i am just overwhelmed that my secret is out. i really hope i can bounce back better than i ever have before.	moderate

i feel like i am years old and i am only . , male here... i have lived the past years of my life experiencing nothing but sadness, anguish, misery, loneliness, rejection, and so much more... i honestly do not even envision myself living past or even getting there. as if i am and i have got that not sure i have many years left ideal in my head. is this a normal feeling? i just want to feel happy, i just want that feeling of solace. i live everyday with opti amism and put my best foot forward to make my dreams and visions possible. i am the pilot here, i understand that... i genuinely want to be happy, i genuinely to find something special in this world... but i am a pilot without proper training and am steering dark in the middle of a storm. ...after years and years of failure, i do not even know why i try anymore. my first attempt was at years old and since i was every day has been exactly the same. i just feel like i have peaked. i feel so old and so weak.	moderate
feel something there was a ti ame when my depression would stir emotions like fire to destroy myself, to die, and to get to that edge of breathing to just feel something. but now, i am so removed from that because i have gone so far past emotion into the depth of no feeling. i could look in a mirror and slit my throat without even losing eye contact. there is no more safety valve, no barrier in which to pause at, to even blink at, not a ripple. that is, i suppose one would say scary, but i do not have any fear anymore. i put forth an act all around me, all see a jovial being of strength and confidence, and yet, it is all an act. there is nothing genuine in anything i do, no spark, no hope or light to see, no color or vibrancy. i am si amply a machine, running a program of code. nothing more. i have no connection to any being, although all would think they do to me, but i am just a shade, an apparition, a ghost but never more. soon, their wi will be a glitch, and series of commands wi will be initiated ...end program ...	moderate

depression headache and excessive tiredness with out being able to sleep restfully hey, something m here... i have been experiencing the worst headaches which feel like a heavy tightness in the fore of my brain. i feel that a truly restful sleep would help, but whenever i shut my eyes i feel that i slip into a deeper anxious and depressed state. it makes naps and early morning waking a fraught experience. i am taking mg of seroquel for sleep. i have not had much success with ads. i would self medicated with cannabis, but that was making my anxiety worse. the current state is due to losing my job of years, so it is kind of situational but i have had mental health issues for years. i am usually just anxious. after long periods of anxiety my state usually turns to depression. i find exercise like yoga and cold water swi amming help. just so over the headache! how do you guys deal with a constant headache? so over it.	moderate

i dont even know... i am a male in my mid s, i can not seem to hold any job longer than a few months or weeks. i live on my own and have litterley less than dollars in my bank and have borrowed thousands from my family just to pay for rent and survive. i feel like i need to run away from it all or end it all. i have absolutely no idea what i want to do whith my life. i can never focus with my education or work and get bored and my depression kicks in as soon as the rush of starting something new fades away. i never post anything on the internet and i am a very quiet person that is completely closed off from the world around me. people always tell me i am intelligent but i see my self as a complete idiot and i have no friends. i latch onto drugs mostly weed ,alcohol and nicotine to make some kind of a emotional connection atleast with my self. i am hate the fact that iv never been in a inti amate relationship and feel completely unesential. iv had a few drinks and that is the only reason i am able to talk about this. i sleep hrs a day and can never sleep at nights. i dont know what to do. sorry but i needed to let this out. i am feeling pretty woozy because of the drinks iv had myself oh and i can never clean up after myself but yeah i am going to post this and try to sleep. good night 	moderate
i am becoming aware of why i wi will be alone forever. i do not know why it suddenly hit me last night. maybe it is because i was petting my cat and looking around my appartment realizing after hes gone, i wi will be alone in this room. but i have realized why all my relationships end with me being cheated on. it is because when i am at work or on a date i am that class clown, charismatic, hard working guy. but the second i get home i look as dead on the outside as i feel on the inside. being fun to talk too is very exhausting and it drains every ounce of life out of me. i have been asked why i am sti will single, i always say because i can only be fun for so long and i believe this is the fundamental flaw in all my relationships. someone falls in love with the happy charming version of me. and i am very open about my depression, but i do not think people understand what it means when i say i can not be happy for longer than hours. every relationship i have been in results in a good beginning. but after they see what i really am, they try and help, and i insist it wi will pass, please be patient. i am sorry this happens. but i either get cheated on or taken advantage of then cheated on. i want to love someone. but i am fundamentally unlovable for long periods of ti ame.	moderate
is depression a single issue or related to another issue? anyone ever find your depression was bc of what you eat? i personally think there is a link between gut health and mental health but that is besides the point. my real question is whether any buddy could tell me if antidepressants or antianxiety meds wi will help me enjoy life again... the last or so years i just have zero interest in daily life ie family, friends and hobbies i uses to love. i am hesitant to jump the gun and get prescribed these meds being the majority of my family are on them. my mom, brother, sister are bipolar which i dont think i am but i may have some kind of depression thisorder. ive done diet changes ie cutting out lactose and gluten for periods of ti ame and had some success at one point for about weeks lol. my symptoms are gi problems, fatigue all day, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts. id never do it bc i dont want mt family to hurt but for whatever reason every ti ame do anything i feel is akward i say out loud i need to ki will myself . kinda a habitual thing now... so anybody got any suggestions? did these meds help you with these things?	moderate

i feel like i should not be depressed? for about the last or so years, i have slipped in and out of depression. it kind of started midway through high school, about the ti ame i was starting to think about college. i have two older siblings, one, my brother, years older, the other, my sister, years older. around the end of my sophomore year, my brother sat down with me in my room and we hung out, and he told me about how he kind of got depressed in high school, and that he didnt want the same to happen to me. it hit me really hard, and i tried, but i could not stop it. winter of junior year was probably the hardest, as it was the most i ever thought about suicide went to a bridge over a frozen river and sat on the edge for a while thinking about whether anyone would give a shit. around the same ti ame, my sister was being very hard on me, and to me it just felt like she didnt believe in my ability to make it to college, and that she though she was so much better. this ended up persisting for a long ti ame, getting worse, to the point where i didnt really talk to her if i didnt have to. it peaked on a vacation, when i was upset. i slammed a car door, and my dad yelled at me, so i yelled back. then my sister said what the hell is your problem and i shouted back, your the last fucking person i want to talk to. some weeks later she texted me, and we talked it over, she made up, but didnt seem to make any progress. now we are sti will in a si amilar situation, where i find it very hard to forgive her. at this point i dont know if i am depressed from family shit or high school shit, but i always feel like i have no one to talk to about it. i have a loop i go through with myself where i get depressed, dont want to talk about it, think about acting out hinting at it to people to get them to pry it from me. then i think no, you re just begging for attention and dont do anything, and suppress it. i know it isnt healthy, but i can not kick myself out of that pattern. my girlfriend of years tries to help me by being there, but i shut her out, because i dont know how to explain how i feel. i dont know if i am asking for help, or just writing this to try to get it out, but there. thanks. tl dr i am depressed, but i always feel like if i try to talk to ppl about it, i am just seeking attention, so i dont.	moderate

i want to lock myself in my room for the next week the title. i can not function normally, i always get judged because i try to say something but it never comes off the way i mean it, and then get defensive over it. my roommates i am in college and some of my other friends make fun of me for being on the spectrum not realizing i actually am aspergers . the only reason i have not ki willed myself is the way i am treated is so fucking inconsistent day to day. some days everyone is telling me how funny i am when i try to be not the punching bag kind of funny and other days everyone laughs at me for not functioning normally. i am considering locking myself in my room for the next week, just playing video games, eating random instant cook meals i have on me like ramen and poptarts, doing homework, and repeating, while subtlety nudging everyone who tries to enter my room to talk to me to leave me alone. i know this is incredibly unhealthy but i honestly have not tried to take care of myself for the past couple weeks.	moderate
how do you know when you re depressed? i have been through a decent amount growing up. whether it is family, personal, relationship, and financial problems. i am a year old female. i do not know if its just phases. my friends and coworkers say it seems like i am depressed, because i say depressing things. i tell them i am not and that i am joking. but i think am i? how i feel daily is.... i feel suffocated. or empty inside. i get stressed. i subconsciously overwork. i have a terrible sleep schedule. i thought i was over my ex, i heard he got a new girlfriend and i was bothered by it, i guess i am not over hi am and it hurts. i am thisinterested in school and my future. i do the bare mini amum. i have want to socialize but i get tired from it afterwards, but empty when no one is available. i am insecure about my physical appearance. dating apps broke me down, i have gotten used and hurt. when decent guys who care like me, i feel this i ammense amount of guilt because i do not feel the same way. these are just.. some things about myself. i felt as though they are normal things that teens go through. but i keep doubting myself. i do not know if i am happy. i do not think i am. i do not know who to go to. i feel as though i am self destructive. someti ames i truly wish i could just sleep forever. i hate thinking nowadays. i need help, please.	moderate

when to accept your dream is not going to come true. how do you make new ones, when it is all you ever wanted. hello i am a year old guy. that is struggling through life. i have came to the conclusion that none of my dreams are going to come true, due to my mental health, social awkwardness, and now my age. i have recently quit a very good paying job that i did not hate. gave thrown away most of my things. then moved into an x garden shed out in the woods. i spend half of my day trying to figure out what is wrong with me. the other half wishing i had the grit to ki will my self. i grew up extremely isolated. my parents got divorced when i was . i grew up on a farm miles from a small town. with my dad and older brother. my dad has some trust and paranoia issues. so other people were not welcome at our home. our whole world was the three of us and the farm. when i was my brother ran away. a few months later my dad moved out. after the state found out they placed me with my mom. she lived in an apartment in a city with my two half brothers. i acted out and spent the rest of my teenage years in and out of juvenile placements. as a young adult i used sold made drugs. in and out of jail finally spending my early and mid twenties in prison. since then i have a few legal issues but not to big of a deal. my dream has always been to find a wife to make a home family with. as ti ame has gone on i have changed it has changed a little the past few years i have been looking for a woman with children. i would really like to be involved raising kids i am very intelligent and have countless ski wills. that i would like to be able to pass on. over the years i have dated a few women. also had two long term relationships. one was woman was very violent and controlling. the other person was a thief, thishonest, unfaithful and no help with anything. she did not have a job for all years. she left me a year ago for a man that beats her, has no car no job and lives at his brothers house. she gave her kids to her mom to raise. i have no problem getting or keeping a job, i have been in a financial position to buy a home a few ti ames,but never have. i am miserable in an empty house. it feels like jail prison someti ames worse. in the last year i have dated women, three of them stole from me. the other one did not want to see me again cause i wouldn t have sex with her. i give up, the harder i try the worse it gets. why can not i just blast this hottie and be done? obviously i am not capable of achieving my dreams. i can not get the thought out of my head of what it would do to my parents. i can not wait for them to die, so i can.	moderate

just felt a little peace that we are in this together. no matter what it is rejection, betrayal, failure, death, isolation ,severe anxiety, mental i willness or even a tiny problem like not being able to lose your virginity you got to realise that there are people here who are going through the exact same thing as you. try to i amagine to share the moment with them and you wi will realise a very big truth about the world that it is not that big and we are actually not that complicated. we get hurt by the same shit and the same shit has happened to a lot of people. people you should talk to and listen to and try to help each other out. i have one of the rarest mental i willness and when i went out to find comfort i met a ton of people with the same problem. in my own bubble i thought i was the only one with this and i am the unluckiest guy in the world to only have to go through this. i found people and i also found solution. solutions that helped me tremendously and comfort that made me smile in a months. break your dark bubble guys and put effort into finding things about your problem and people going through si amilar things. this way you can work as a group to find answers and help each other out in the ti ame of need. it is ti ame to talk and find solutions my people life is running out it is better to die fighting than succumbing.	moderate

i have not felt like myself for the past two months and i hate it prepare for a long read potentially. i need to get it out somehow i suppose. but the past two months i have felt like a completely different person. one of my extremely close friends that i game with online made a new friend that he plays with a lot more than me. and he started excluding me from the group and not inviting me. so i would start asking hi am if i could play, trying to insert myself into the games to have fun. and he said that i was being pushy and taking away game ti ame from his other friends... that is when i told hi am that i felt like i was being placed on the backburner and that it made me feel really shitty. like i was not good enough to be included. and he told me i was overreacting. but he continued to always jump to play with his new friends. i felt like i was always hassling hi am when i asked to play something. eventually i brought up all of my feelings insecurities about the situation again. i also mentioned how he would respond to messages from the new friends in our chat, but ignore mine. i pointed out that i can see that i was being ignored, and that it made me feel once again, shitty. like i was not good enough even though i try so hard to be a good inclusive friend... after this final chat, he got very defensive and said that he did not have to justify who he messages which i do understand and that he gravitates towards the new people because i always seem too needy. so i decided it would be best to give myself space and cut off all contact with hi am for the past month. and it has destroyed me. the whole process, everything that he said that made me feel so little and uncared for. i opened up to hi am about how i struggled with self esteem and depression and that that probably contributed to why i felt like crap when he did not include me. his response was that he did not have the mental capacity to worry how his actions made me feel .... and i was thinking.. well most friends generally care if they upset their friends. intentional or not... so that is why i decided i needed a break from it all. anyway, through all of it so far.. i have just felt like absolute trash. idk why.. i just try so hard and put into my friendships, am always there for my friends when they need me to vent or talk.. and i just expected the same. and i got treated like my problems weren t i amportant. the first week that i did not chat with hi am, i literally was nauseous .. could not eat.. and lost pounds in a week. it was not until this week that i finally started feeling a minuscule fragment of peace... but it always fades. and i fall right back into thinking of everything that happened.. and how i am just not valued as a friend or person. and that ki wills me inside. i have always struggled with confidence, depression, and self esteem.. and it just builds and builds. he text me this week randomly and just said something like hope you re doin fine. miss playin with ya . super short. and part of me does miss my friend. and want this sadness to end and just be friends again. but at the same ti ame, i feel like he just does not value me as a true friend and the cycle would repeat. i lose either way. i have lost a brother like friend in the past and in did the same thing to me. i take things extremely personal and my brain just ingrains the negative experiences in my mind.. i am not sure what to do with myself. i have started eating again and gained the weight back. but i do not feel like myself. i am not actually happy at all. i fake it when i do interact with others. but in my mind, i am jsut telling myself over and over that i am a piece of shit that can not even keep his friends... all because of this experience. i am not sure what i am hoping to get out of this post.. i am just really emotional right now and would just love to chat i suppose. life sucks. and i hate that i can not just make my brain be normal and not care as much. but i can not. i am a prisoner in my own mind.	moderate
no one knows how bad i am doing i do not want to thisappoint anyone. i am just not capable of getting better at this point, i think. i have been sick for so long and made so little progress. i lie to people in my life about how i am doing a lot and am starting to regret it. they want me to be more active and start working towards a healthier life, and all i can think is fuck, i just want to die... in fact today i saw my doctor and lied my ass off, then i went home and cried... lol... why should i tell anyone the truth though? no one cares unless you want to ki will yourself... and why would i tell anyone about that? it is just inviting them to stop me and throw me in a mental hospital. i am so sick of living lol. wish i had both the motive and means to end it all. but i do not. i am stuck here, at least for now. i wi will never get better or have a normal life. and that is my pathetic pity post of the week. i hope you all enjoyed. lol i am so fucking worthless	moderate

i am going to write book since i was in grade i have been depressed. i am now in grade and things are only getting worse. i am shit at everything i do, except thing i believe i am actually good at. and that is writing. as a kid i would always love to read and write. but i want to make an i ampact. i dont care if its unoriginal. i want to send a message to parents that depression is an i willness. you can not feel depressed. you can feel sad, but that is different. depression isnt something you can make go away by hanging out with some friends or winning in a sport. calling a child ungrateful because they are depressed is the equivalent to calling someone with autism dumb. it is not ok, its fucking terrible. you say this with someone else listening you ll get your shit kicked in. you call a child ungrateful because they are depressed but parents wi will agree. this should not be acceptable. i want people to know that depression is an issue. the school system is fucked. work is terrible. i dont care how stupid i sound, but i want to start a movement. i want to tell the world that things need to change. the school system puts too much pressure on kids to do things. parents wi will punish you for not being able go do things. and so maybe you think it is only like that because the real world with jobs and work is hard. well that doesnt make it any better. theres tons of things we could do to make it better. give a day off once a month that doesnt count towards your normal days off for mental health. give more flexible hours. make i am not feeling great a valid reason to not work. people are ki willing themselves because nobody does anything. they feel alone. nobody pays attention to it. i want to change that. and call me crazy but i think i have the writing ski wills to do it. maybe i can not cure depression but i have a dream to make it easier to cope with.	moderate
this is hell i am in hell, thisguised as life. its not the cartoonish hell people i amagine and most people would probably think i am being dramatic. hell need not be obvious, the little torments add up. day after day, year after year, they wear you down. but this specially tailored hell has no escape. the desire to end it is there, but the ability to carry it out is not. no matter what i do or how desperate i am, something binds me here. that is the real hell. being trapped. having no escape. i used to tell myself if it ever got bad enough, i could die. but deep down i know that is not true. i wi will never do it because i can not. that is part of the hell. stuck at least for the next or so years, probably forever. just enough ability to feel joy now and again to keep me from going numb to it all. just enough anxiety to keep me from showing it. if i were satan, this would be the hell i craft.	moderate
just late night rambles i feel a bit stuck in life. i feel like control is slipping away from me, or maybe i have never had any control. i just feel deeply thisappointed in myself for what my life is currently, but empathetic enough to understand it really could not have turned out much different. i have got a lot going against me in life in terms of circumstance. i was not born into a life where i could thrive and creating my own environment where i can has been largely trial and error with a lot of it not sticking. i feel like every choice i make is the wrong one, every wish i dream is unattainable, but i keep trying and i keep failing and floating farther from what it is i i amagine my life could be. i wish i knew what to do. i wish i could have learned these things. i wish i had support and knowledge from those around me... but i am just floating and suffering and looking for aid but i am all i have got and i am i will equipped.	moderate
i dont know if i am depressed first off, id like to apologise for how unorganized this is. i dont even know what more to say because my mindset atm is why do i bother, no one cares anyway. you are probably just going through a dumb phase but ive been feeling extremely down since like th grade i am a freshman now. i keep on telling myself that i have no reason to be sad. i have told my parents about how i get stressed for no reason at all, or i get stressed and i forget what i was stressing about, which makes me even more stressed. all they said was, lets pray then and its just your personality, i was like this too and it makes me even more sad that my parents dont realize that i need help. but also i wonder to myself, do i really need help or am i just overreacting. i over think so much and it stresses me out. the overthinking eventually leads me to the conclusion that no one wants me around and that i am a burden to everyone in my life. whenever i reach out for help and someone tries offer help i just refuse and say that theyre wrong. like whenever someone tells me that i no one wi will love me because i havent loved myself first i get so mad because i dont know what to do about not loving myself. i do feel happy someti ames, but very soon, that feeling is gone. ive made a great friend this year and i hang out with her friends, but i havent been able to get very close to them. this friend also goes through way worse and i dont even know how she keeps such a happy attitude, and it makes me think to myself that i am so pathetic. ive also been struggling with my sexuality and my family is homophobic, because of religion. i am also very introverted and am too scared to talk to people everyone inti amidates me. i am very scared to talk to an adult about this like someone at school because i just dont want to say how i am feeling and be told that i have no reason to feel that way, when i already know that. i just dont want to exist anymore, like i dont want to commit suicide, i just dont want to live. what i am trying to say is that i dont think i have a reason to feel depressed because i have a great life and yet here i am posting this long unorganized rant on the depression subreddit. theres no one to blame but myself.	moderate
i am not saying i want to die i just do not care if i do anymore i have not cared for a while but was not always truly not caring. now i am at the point we re i truly could not care less if i lived of died. i have no idea what i am doing with life anymore or why i am doing the things i am doing. for a long ti ame i was in a very dark place. a place beyond crippling depression. almost like feeling like your crazy but aware of it and there is nothing you can do to fix it. in that ti ame in my life i did not have a single person that genuinely cared about me. even my parents took every chance they could to make it worse. they knew what i was going though and would tell me they know even though i denied it then they would just start saying to worse possible things to me to just complete crush my confidence and wi will to live. it is almost like they were trying to push me to go completely insane with the things they would say. they would do things then when i brought it up they would pretend it never happened and tell me there must be something wrong with my brain because my reality does not match there. all that was a few years ago and it got a little better for a little but it sti will messes with my head a lot now. i went through years with that having nobody care about me and having my parent treat me the way they did. plus i was doing a bunch of hard drugs during that ti ame like that long prescription pain pi wills and xanax and worst of all smoking a lot of k . after so log of not being cared about when i went of and started hanging out with friends i just could not feel that they or anyone else really cared about me. even know i know i have people in my life that care about me i just can not feel it. even if they make is it obvious they care i can not feel it. after so many years of not feeling any real actual love from anyone it is like if completely lost the ability to feel love. now all on my way! feel is sadness and anger. it takes a lot of me to get angry but when i do i just go nuts and start doing and saying this that i should not and i always regret it in the end. i know my friend care about me because they show me all the ti ame but i just can not feel it. it is theworst fucking thing ever. it is like a curse. my dad use to beat me a little when i was younger. it was not really anything too bad but it was beyond a regular beating. anyway i am not bringing that up to complain about that too because no i do not care about that i was really young and it does not really affect me. i bring it up because i would rather go though those beatings every day that constantly go though this mental torment. i just hope somehow someway something come into my life that makes me feel loved or gives me my wi will to live. i wouldn t commitsuicide but idk i just can not handle this too much longer. after years of having theses peoples and just suppressing them i feel like i actually starting to go schizophrenic. i know nobody is going to be able to really held so i do not even know why i am posting is people are just going to give the same old generic we love you comments i guess i just thought to vent on here for a try.	moderate
i am wasting my life i wake up do nothing productive even though i have things to do the fact that i need to put so much effort makes me avoid them. also i do not have any interest other than watching dramas and even dramas get boring so i turn some drama on and read webtoon on my phone. another day was wasted and i feel useless. i feel like i need to die.	moderate
fantasising about getting help but not taking any chances i know the title makes no sense, whatever. i am having a horrible ti ame, i do not see myself alive by the end of this year if i am being honest. i am feeling like complete shit. all i do is lay in bed and cry and procrastinate. i always have butterflies in my stomach no matter what i do or where i go, someti ames it is bad enough to make me vomit. during math two weeks ago i was on the verge of breaking down. we were doing a test but i could not remember anything on it either so i just sat there avoiding handing in. i kept thinking that if i just chose to hand it in after class i could leave so i wouldn t have to be there when he looks through it. all that did was bring more attention to me though because i was the only one who sti will had not finished it. teacher knew something was up and told me to stay after class and i just told hi am i was a little stressed. i regret it so much, that was my chance to get help and all i did was fuck up again. i feel so dumb	moderate
nothing has been the same since meg. i had my first serious girlfriend in , her name was meg. while i would like to think it was her fault and that is what i have told people it really was not. these past few months it is been hard to realise that i was controlling and too much for her and that is why she went off with someone else. i came to realise because i am too much for everyone, i went out with a few friends yesterday to play football soccer. one of the guys their when i said can i have a shot asked if i was getting loud? then punched me quite a few ti ames in the face. i am done with this shit man i do not know what it is that i do that makes people think i am cocky or annoying but i have tried everything to change it. i am done with this life, peace out.	moderate

i am ok with being depressed. i have found my self being depressed and lonely for most of my life and it is become a part of me. a big part. my depressing life story i think it started back in middle school grade when i moved countries and came to north america. i was seen as an outsider by the other kids and targeted as a easy victi am of playground bullying. i learned from it and even managed to start playing at lunch ti ame with the same kids that bullied me by the ti ame middle school came into its final year grade . after this i would enter highschool and out of fear i befriended as many people as i could when i first joined. after grade in highschool i would move to another highschool in a different city and then again . in highschool i started sleeping hours a day, i would sit on my phone in the washroom for an hour or more, i would take showers and baths for more than an hour. basically i had turned myself off and with my family being as stressed as they were with their finances i became the emotional punching bag at home. any frustration in our house would basically result in me getting an earfull someti ames for hours of me gettting yelled at and yes its me getting yelled at when of the conversation is not me . being emotionally turned off was extremely painful because i was a teenager trying to look for his place in the world and hoping for someone to take notice in me and give a fuck about me. as a result i began to be extremely closed off and would feel lonely no matter where i was or how many people were around me. after highschool we moved from canada to the states and life hit that reset button another ti ame. it would be a good year of not having any friendships before i started college. and even with college i felt thisadvantaged as all the other students had their own cars and wore much nicer clothes than i did the yezees had just came out and i was the only one in the group without a pair . at this point i starting realizing that i was not necessarily privileged and that my parents had tried their best to keep me from that reality. the depression had caught up with my education as it always did and i was basically a moving peice of meat. i was completely absent in my mind and had latched on to smoking weed on a daily basis to make everything numb so i wouldnt feel the pain and i could ignore my own thoughts. obviously this is not a good state for a student and i got kicked out of college with a gpa of . ...yes . . i decided to move back to canada on my own and well its been a year and iv been through hell and back. i was abused right and left by employers. i could not even hold a job at mcdonalds or at a grocery store. i worked in construction in the rain, the snow, the blaring sun and wind. i keep going through job after job and can never mange to get a rhythm that other adults seem to get into seamlessly. i borrowed thousands from my family just in the course of the past year and as of right now i dont even have enough credit to buy a decent meal let alone pay my rent. i feel like i am hurting myself and everyone around me because i am not emotionally stable enough to care for my self. oooh and did i mention i have no friends or social life because well if i go out to grab a drink i can not even afford that. i think twice before buying a dollars . bus ticket. i feel completely hopeless and lost. i am not necessarily suicidal but iv been suicidal many ti ames before and that is probably the only reason i wi will not allow myself to be suicidal basically i can see that road and i see it as a roundabout . i want to give up however. i want to run away from it all. i need someone to fucking grab me and fucking hug me and never fucking let go. i need to fucking feel like i am fucking alive. i need to fucking feel like i can fucking be loved by someone who is not fucking biologically told to fucking love me. i can not fucking make myself happy. i can not fucking make anyone else happy. i dont know what the fuck to do. someone please talk to me ask me about my life give a fuck about me i am fucking scared	moderate
exercise and healthy eating does nothing for me. being a psychology student, i have had it dri willed into me that exercise and a healthy diet has been proven to promote good mental health and aid in the management recovery of depression and anxiety. this is not an ignorant assumption, this is a proven fact. except it is never worked for me and i truly feel that my depression is resistant on every level. i used to like sports........you know before i grew boobs and started sweating more than the average person due to polycystic ovaries. and even when i thisliked exercise, i tried so so hard to get into jogging and more sports, for about years. i hated nearly every second of it, because it made me feel physically terrible and i could never build any resilience at all. i could never jog for more than a minute, it took me months to get to a point where i could do squats without having crippling muscle pain the next day. and no matter what i did, i could never do a single pushup. healthy eating also did nothing. my mood is not affected by what i eat, not even coffee does anything to me. so whether i go vegan for an entire week or keep my usual carb and sugar loaded diet, i sti will feel the same. what makes it worse is that i even tried medication and it did not make a difference. i am untreatable. whether that is due to my brain chemistry and physiology or something very wrong in my perception, i do not know.	moderate
it is changed me i hate how this has sucked all the life out of me. i have zero confidence, no motivation and hate the way i look. i can not stick to anything and feel like a constant failure. i struggle to keep my house clean, i am forgetful, i can not muster the energy to go exercise and make excuses instead. i fall asleep all the ti ame and forget about i amportant stuff. worst sti will is that my other half does not think that depression is real and that people make it up for attention so i have to hide my feelings. i tried counselling through work but found them to be cold and unsympathetic which only added to the problem. i am struggling to come terms with the fact i was abused for years by my narcissistic parents. as a result i am presently going through the wringer with my emotions because i was always told to stop crying, suck it up and pull myself together. does anyone have any tips to help me wade through this sludge and maybe see the light at the tunnel?	moderate

help it feels like i have nobody to go to, i know i have friends and family but i just do not feel comfortable talking about some of things i think about. i started smoking marijuana to help with some of this, and i got to say it has helped me beyond expectations. but yesterday i got caught by my mother, who is sti will stuck in the mindset that it ki wills people. so now i am having the one thing that helps me, the thing that motivates me to do school work, makes it easier to be social, helps me stop thinking about the stuff i do not want to think about, it is just going to be stripped away from me. i do not want to say all of this to my parents cause they do not care how i feel, they never have. they have never cared enough to even just ask if i am okay. they have never cared enough to ask why i act the way that i do, all they are worried about is me going to college and getting a good job so that they do not have to work. they do not care about my well being. i know that if i tell them this they wi will just call bullshit and it wi will make things worse. anyone who is been in a si amilar situation, please help. i do not know what to do with myself right now.	moderate
i think i am destined to be thisliked. it does not matter where i am. school, college, home, online. there is something about me that makes people despise me and treat me like the most repulsive thing ever. i do not know what it is. maybe i am too awkward, quiet, ugly. most likely a combo of all three. the few relationships i managed to form turned to nothing, and now i have spent years with nothing but loneliness. now i am trying to convince the successful people in the world to hire a waste of space. part of me does not even want to try, in fear that anyone forced to be around me wi will i ammediately thislike me. i just really want to end it, i hope i get the courage soon.	moderate
the end of it the season, i died. i slit my throat amp every where else i knew would bleed. i lost my loved ones because they could not handle caring about someone who could not live for themself. i did die. i fantasize the memory, but unfortunately i did not fully fade. i am sti will here. the only thing keeping me from trying again is the sweet smoke of mary jane. typical, i know. but it is the only thing that truly thissipates my suicidal obsession. i do not crave other drugs though someti ames i think perhaps i would be better off catching an addiction amp spiraling towards futility. i dread the weather warming as i wi will be covering up no matter the temperatures now. i try to see my scars as art of my skin. a representation of how hard it is been for me to survive. but i realize that is stupid. i destroyed my skin amp now it is my responsibility to keep it hidden from the world because no one deserves to be upset by the fact i was upset in the past.	moderate
i do not know what to feel i m constantly feel empty and emotionless. i am not sure why. i fail to see any purpose in my life and very often get sudden moments where i feel like just crying or running away from everyone and everything. i do not like who i am at all, and it always feels like nobody else does either. in the past i have had problems with drinking and feel like it is soon going to resurface. i do not even feel like being awake anymore. i just try to keep myself busy with work and stuff at home because i know there are people who feel stronger than me and hurt themselves etc, therefore i almost feel like my mental state is not justified. i am sorry if this is an inappropriate place to post this, it is just that i have really nowhere else to write or talk about it. my friends have kept slipping away from me and getting girlfriends, spending their ti ame with them. i barely have the motivation or energy to even get out of my bed or meet people anymore. it is getting harder to even see the point in being alive. i hope this does not sound too emotional or dramatic, i just do not know how to word it any differently.	moderate

no one really cares. people do not care. they may say they care, they may invite you to chat, but once you open up they hit the ground running. they do not really care. they love to pretend they care, because pretending to help someone is easier then actually giving a shit. it is all so they wi will feel better about themselves by pretending to care. when the chips are down, and shit gets real, they wi will gladly throw anyone under the bus to save their own ass. i have had my own flesh and blood backstab me twice. all my friends ditched me when i started high school, leaving me to such abuse, i was encouraged daily to commit suicide. only reason why ppl pretend to care is so they can pat themselves on their back at the end of the day feeling like calling the cops on a depressed girl saved her life, when all it did was make her feel like she can not show any emotion, and has to remain empty void to avoid being thrown in a asylum. just remember, no one really cares.	moderate

god, if my parents weren t looking so forward to spending my birthday with me tomorrow, i would od on xanax on alcohol tonight. i have the supplies and the lack of wi will to live. i am exhausted from the same toxic cycles, the attempts to communicate amicably which get thrown back in my face and am being accused of attacking or accusing, when i am just trying to communicate. i am just so tired. i am going on my second night with no sleep. i am in such a dark place and i try to communicate clearly to avoid repeating mistakes and having the same arguments, but i just get smacked down again and nothing changes. i am just tired and i do not want to live anymore. i am tired of explaining my reasons that nobody listens to a years. i am tired of this turning point looming over me and i just can not tackle it. it is too much. everything is too much. i feel myself getting number everyday, i am either constantly sad or at best numb. i hate it. i hate the prescriptions, i am tired of talking to therapists, i am tired of being completely mitigated. i am tired of trying to resolve and then being made into the bad guy for trying to communicate what affects me. worst birthday ever. but i could not make it worse for my parents before i see them. should i tell them i want to so they are not blindsighted and it has nothing to do with them? i do not want to get thrown in the looney bin again. i am just not happy. nobody cares enough to help me even though i am very straightforward with what i need to feel better. i do not want to have to meet new people in order to feel good about myself, but the present people in my life do not and i can not do it myself.	moderate

my girlfriend left me two months ago and i can not recover as context for everything, i have what they used to call asperger is now it is just part of the autism spectrum. social interactions have always been hard for me and as a result, strong interpersonal relationships are rare for me. this relationship was my first. we met when we were , and we broke up at the age of in mid jan. i have struggled on and off with depression for about two years now because of a terrifying social trauma involving my girlfriend and an attempted rape by a close friend of mine. that was the start of my mental health issues. although i struggled with depression and anxiety, my parents were a major cause of my issues. my psychologist suggested moving out asap so i ended up taking fluoxetine, getting a job and saving up enough money to move out. i eventually managed to escape my toxic parents house and moved out to a studio apartment on university campus. my girlfriend, although she did not pay rent, de facto lived with me and helped with the associated costs of living out. living on campus during the quiet tri amester, over christmas, was painful to begin with. we would spend our days either watching tv, smoking weed or doing both. eventually, things managed to get better. my depression calmed and i felt happier, my girlfriend who comes from an abusive catholic background finally had escaped her family too. shit was good. i was visiting my family and because i did not have to live and deal with their obsessive rules, regulations and helicoptering on a daily basis, that ti ame i spent with them stopped being punishment but instead a fun dinnerti ame conversation. during this period, we were so confident we had already started working on baby names our first daughter was going to be called ella louise hope dutton , a combination of her middle names, my surname and our favourite name of all ti ame. i really, really attached myself to this beautiful woman. we did not use girlfriend and boyfriend anymore she was my partner. we had really managed to grow up living by ourselves made our relationship so much better. she saved me from myself, honestly. she made me a better person, gave me motivation to join the greens and inspired me to start working towards my goal, something i really value. things started going south when i was rear ended by a bus. my car that i had worshipped for the last year, a volkswagen passat . l v , with upgraded infotainment and in mint condition, was destroyed in the blink of an eye by no fault of my own. i got fucked over badly by my insurance company allianz australia apparently the bus company refused to release the cctv footage from the incident and allianz therefor i ammediately capitulated. i lost half of the value of my car due to an unfair charging of premiums for the next months totalling dollars . k and an excess of dollars . k which was deducted, even before liability was settled. as a result, i relied on my partner to drive me everywhere whilst i worked hard for enough to buy a better quality car than a measly dollars . k could buy me with such high standards set by my vw. that would have been alright and understandable, if it was not december and i did not work in retail, at the biggest shopping centre in the southern hemisphere, for a very popular international brand. having to deny extra shifts to help with christmas trading really pissed my manager off, especially as i was casual, not part ti ame, for that very reason. i am not saying that me losing my car contributed to the loss of my job. to be completely honest, although the politics of my workplace made game of thrones look like a dr. seuss plot, i si amply was the first to be made redundant as not just the store, but the company itself was reporting losses in the hundreds of mi willions of dollars. as a result of losing my car and my job, i was stranded in a studio apartment in an area with little to no public transport. unable to go grocery shopping, to pick up weed, to visit my family or friends. i had been doing so well with everything, but finally i gave in to my depression. i relapsed big ti ame and started smoking copious amounts of weed . she begged me to stop, to get my shit together, to stop being angry at everyone. i do not know how many chances she had given me by the ti ame that she left me. she could not cope with my behaviour anymore. i pushed her away because i had lost sight of normality. she said that she really loves me. she does not love me in a romantic way though, but more as a brother that she extremely cares about. as i sti will love her, to this day, with all of my heart that hurts, a lot. a brother. after four years. i struggled to be friends . she came over to my apartment to hang out, but it just ended up with both of us in tears. it was not my apartment. it was our apartment. i begged her to change her mind but with each ti ame we saw each other, my pleas got more desperate and she got more thistant. i ampulse control is really difficult for me. i do not understand why, but someti ames i understand what i am doing is bad and continue to do it anyway. maybe it has something to do with my childhood, or maybe it is me just being a right fucking arsehole. but for some reason, i can not forgive myself at all and constantly find myself text her, apologising for everything that i have ever done. as i struggle with interpersonal relationships, i am finding that i have an increasingly small group i can trust and rely on day to day. it is not like we even had sex for the longest ti ame before the breakup we could sti will be friends. my brain is going around in circles, having day long anxiety attacks coated in cannabis and abusing my prescribed ritalin to just feel alright being alive. although i know that life wi will go on without her, i can not seem to cope losing not just my girlfriend, but my best and only friend. the best friend i have ever had. and i chose a substance over my soulmate. if anything, my depression is only getting worse. i can not seek help i just honestly can not change even when given multiple chances by the woman that i adore. we had already named our first daughter. today i found out she has a new boyfriend, only because my friends tripped up on a lie around me by accident.	moderate
when you make a troll account to let off steam and then realize you are actually turning into an asshole so life is cruel and anger is everywhere. no surprise there. we all need some way to vent, at least one trusted friend or lover to vent to. when one is alone for years and can see no hope on the horizon, what do they do about the buildup of anger? i thought a good idea would be to make a troll account so i can just let out whatever sarcastic or angry reactions that came to me. then i started enjoying being rude to people who would be baited by my responses. then i woke up one day and realized i was pathetic on a whole new level.	moderate
i told my friends i told them a lot of things about my life involving depression. and my trauma with my sister. i told them so much and i thought i was doing the right thing. i thought it felt good. but when we all went to sleep i realized how much worse i feel now. why does nothing help. my sister has severe depression and she makes me feel like i have less issues, so i can not make a scene. my parents can not handle another kid having depression so they act like i am fine. i just want to lay in bed forever, but school is always around the corner. i have always got by because i took it one day at a ti ame. but all the days are the same. my friends act like they care so much but they never worry about me. they only care about the rich white kid who acts like he is depressed. literally one of my friends did not respond to texts for a day and people thought she ki willed herself. they worried so much about her. but i never respond to texts and people just call me a bitch. why does no one care about me.	moderate

i did it for me, i did it all i was so depressed months ago. i stood over a bridge and all i could think about was my family. they would be so upset if i was gone. even if it was just for a few days, i can not hurt my family like that so i wrote notes for them all. it would help them move on. but then i thought about my little brother. i know he would blame hi amself. i just can not do it to them so i forced myself to get better. i forced myself to get a job and do well at uni and to be the best me, the me that i always wanted to be and the me that they wanted me to be. and i met someone. and he is just so patient with me and he is beautiful to me and for a second i did it all, i did it all for me. i forced myself to get better. and then months after that dark sad cloud crawled it is way back over my head again. yes i have money, and my loving family and my boyfriend but i just can not help but feel alone. i just can not help but want to be gone. it would be so much easier if i never existed in the first place. nobody would miss me then, nobody would blame them self.	moderate
i do not know what i should do i do not even know where to begin or how to start it all. i m y.o. and i have almost lost all hope. i can not remember when was the last day i was happy from beginning to the end. it usually starts good, then it gets gradually worse. i have a lot of things to do but i end up procrastinating the shit out of everything, until i give up on the idea of doing anything. i do not have any consistent future plans, days or even weeks pass without me doing anything productive whatsoever, i just sit here in a constant vegetative state. i really want to pull myself together to actually do something serious, but i never can. i do not feel motivated at all and i got to the conclusion that there s no way for me to get any type of solid motivation aside from some short lasting energy sprouts. my friends never reach out to me, they never search for me, it is always me who does the first move, they even end up ghosting me, and when i ask them if i did anything wrong to them they usually say that it is just the way they are or that everything is actually fine between us, then they would hang out with me once or twice out of pity i believe and they would always tell me that they would never ghost me again, which eventually happens after less than weeks. i only have one friend that talks to me in a somewhat constant way, but i do not feel like care that much about me either. i just feel very replaceable and think that if i weren t here, it wouldn t make any difference. i have also grown unresponsive to kind words, always thinking that the people saying them do not mean anything for real. my only coping mechanism i have is taking walks alone through my neighborhood or through the city while listening to music, but it makes no difference, because all i can think of while taking those walks is how much i want someone to be by my side during those moments. i had a photography passion but i ended up almost quitting it, because the pictures i was taking were not giving me good memories anymore. i often see myself looking at the pictures i took in the past and romanticizing those periods in my life and the things i used to do back then. recently, the thing i was most afraid of happened i took up some unhealthy coping mechanism like alcohol and nicotine, and it is sad to say that i only feel truly alright when i am under the influence, which always drives me back to them. i asked people for advice but they always brush me off with things like things wi will get better or i am rooting for you or just grow out of it and i got afraid and embarassed to ask anyone for help, even my parents. i really want to seek therapy, but if i tell my parents about it, they wi will start playing therapist with me my mother does not believe in such things as thiseases or depression and she is a really big fan of the power of suggestion or the law of attraction and things like that and she always fi wills my mind with crap . i have no idea what to do. if you made it through this far, i apologise for rambling this much and thank you for reading this. i just wanted to speak to someone ab it.	moderate

how do i deal with high school bullying ? how do i deal with high school bullying ? in high school i was severely bullied, neglected and abused. they made fun of my defects physical and mental ones , belittled me, and that created mental health problems for me, lots of them. i got depressed, anxious and it also affected my self esteem as they called me a sociopath for having no friends. this negative era of my life also affected family and grades. they have no sense of empathy so i think they are the sociopathic ones. instead of helping me out they just look at me with a thisgusted face and say get help or get a psychologist even though they definitely never went though something like this and are just saying that to send me away beacuse they probably dont even realise that therapy doesnt work most of the ti ame. they just li amit themselves to that, and they dont even say that with compassion or anything of the kind. just shows how they lack empathy and how they arr ignorant about mental health. they called me names like dumb fuck for having bad grades even though depression holds back people and their intelligence, so i am not at my full potential and yet sti will they say that, really shows how ignorant they are. nowadays i have suicidal thoughts beacuse of this treatment and homicidal thoughts beacuse i hate them for doing this to me. how do i overcome this ?	moderate

i can not enjoy the si ample things in life anymore i do not enjoy almost anything anymore. i enjoy talking to certain people, listening to music, food... that is about it. someti ames i can enjoy watching something but it takes a lot of effort to get myself i ammersed enough into it. as an example of this... games. two months me and my ex broke up after a month relationship. everything was fine with us, we went on a date a week before and we were getting on well with few arguments. i found out why recently and its thisturbing, but it was not her fault or mine. i was playing a game when she text me explaining that she feels like she can not cope with everything anymore, and since then i have been depressed. too depressed to enjoy games, or most things anymore. i am wanting to build a pc soon to try and thistract myself through making music amongst other things, and seeing if maybe then i can enjoy games, as i have since i was very young. not enjoying games is not the problem, of course. it is an example, amongst many others, of the things i just can not enjoy anymore no matter how hard i try. someti ames in the day i just feel really full of energy and in the mood to just listen to music loud and dance, then other ti ames i find myself wanting to just end it all. a lot of bad things have happened since, but i have got over the relationship now. i feel sorry for her with what happened to make her feel this way. and i have recently started a new job. i do not know why i am so depressed but i am. i try to hide it with a world of thistractions and if i bury my thoughts with enough thistraction, i am fine, until i am not. tldr depression makes it hard to enjoy things, does anyone else feel the same and can relate?	moderate

depression lets me perceive reality in such a worse way i just felt somehow stable. i just felt some joy for some days. but then i got to hear, that my ex boyfriend got a new girlfriend. and it just broke me. he never managed to have a clearing breakup conversation with me. and i think somehow i sti will got hope. when i am fine, i can deal with the break up. i can understand it. i can move on. when my depression kicks in, all i can think of is dying. i can not deal with the pain of the break up anymore. my suffering just gets so intensely. it is just absurd. so today i took a benzo again, to not follow my suicidal thoughts. i do not get it. why i am struggling so hard. i know reality is not as bad as my depression makes it. but i can not stop it from coming. i can not fight it. it just overtakes. after i took the benzo, i feel like anyone else. just fine. for some hours at least. why am i so fragile. as soon as something bad happens, my depression comes back. even though i had medication and i am sti will in therapy, i can not handle it. i just want to be normal. not even happy. just calm and sane. fine with myself. and okay with reality.	moderate
does not it feel like everything you say is bullshit to others? i have been depressed for a long ti ame now, never had parents because they abused me or any real friends that actually cared about me. at my school i am just by myself and i feel like everything i say to others gets ignored or just is considered bullshit. it just makes me feel so dumb because i just get ignored all the ti ame and when they finally talk to me they just say something quick and do not care. idk if it is me, am i a loser, am i dumb and am i wrong? all these thoughts just get to my head and as soon as i get home zi just lock myself in my room and do not get any texts and it is just like no one likes me and i do not have anyone.	moderate
how can i cheer up i feel like my friends which i have known for most of my life have become tired of me because i am hyperactive. i have found out they have had a number of plans without me and i feel like they just do not like me anymore. feeling this, i tried to make new friends, but the same thing happened even quicker with them. i have found a friend group now who are nicer and for now, do not thislike me. my mum can see i am depressed someti ames and she thinks it is because i spend my weekends indoors on technology because i never get invited to anything , so she tries tirelessly to get me out the house and to try something new. however, most of these things i find very boring or not something i would like to do, and she gets upset and angry at me because she thinks i would rather spend all my ti ame indoors and i am depressed because of it. this is not true, as i am completely fine with being at home for a day, or having no friends. what i can not bare is not knowing if my friends really like me or not. my mum like i am sure many others do drags me to these places i would rather not be, as she thinks it is in my best interests. not wanting to go to many of these places, i often act sad and negative when we go, which ruins it for her and makes her feel upset. i hate for my mum to feel sad, though i physically can not have a positive attitude to these things i can not cheer up even if i want to. the same thing happens every weekend she talks to me about this new place she wants to take me, i commonly reject it, she begs me to come out, i either go or i do not, but either way she ends up becoming sad and not enjoying her day. i feel like a failure and a thissapointment, as i have lost all my hobbies to my sadness. summary i feel like my mum does not understand my problems and thinks it is because i do not get out, when really it is my social issues. i tell her this, but she insists that going out is the best way to help, which i know it is. when she tries to find something to do i often thislike it or do not want to go, which puts me in a low mood as i am being forced to do something i do not want to, and this ruins whatever we plan to do or are doing for my mum. i know this sounds incredibly chilthish but it is making me feel incredibly shit and i want a way out. thank you for reading this	moderate

idk if i am really bad in life or just being dramatic it is been months since i started treatment for my anxiety, weeks ago i was feeling rather nice but the feelings of despair and sadness stroke me recently and sti will are today . however i someti ames feel i am just being dramatic with myself... that the roots of my despair are meaningless and maybe dayly life to most people. like, a lot of people can not afford food, water, home, healthcare, their studies... just like there is people who have suffered from constant bullying racism or even harassement... my life is fine with that, nothing i meantioned happened to me or has been lacking, i can pay my studies as well around a month , and that is why someti ames i feel i am just a stupid spoiled person who wants x to happen in my life so bad, that if x does not happen i start panicking... which is basicaly the source of my anxiety mostly social romantic related x s . i have been told countless ti ames that problems are problems and should never be compared but sti will, someti ames i am even afraid to vent, thinking people wi will rather thing i am dramatic	moderate

sadness as an identity and a routine is less talked about. this is how it engulfs you. for a long ti ame, i did not feel sad about feeling sad because, you see, i could identify as a raging feminist, a fierce writer, a music connoisseur. but out of all these, i identified as a sad person. i have dreaded introductory classes for as long as i can remember because when the professor asks me to introduce myself to the class, all i really want to say is that i am morose and that is all there is to know about me. if i had to, i could not pinpoint to a particular day on which this began. one day, i felt deeply sad. the next day, i felt the same. since the bracing up was becoming a lot of work , i wanted to get it over with. so,i iooked into what more was in store for me. before i knew, i started making room for sadness . i curled up ti will i accli amatized to it. gradually, it started to feel like home and the thing about home is that there is no need to leave at all. on one occasion, i sat bleary eyed through an entire night to perfect a presentation i was looking forward to work on for months. when i was called up to present it the next day , i rushed through it half heartedly and murmured an apology to the professor. i had seen my colleagues beaming with pride so many ti ames after being lauded for their commendable jobs. i could not recall the last ti ame i felt that way. so when the opportunity came, i was too scared to feel something this foreign. what if it felt nothing out of the ordinary? what if i was not cut out for this kind of satisfaction? after all, chasing happiness had left me so depleted that i could not feel it like others. my colleagues told me to be brave and see a therapist. i did not want to be brave because being brave means trying to heal. while everybody tells you about the magical powers of healing, nobody tells you about how much unlearning is required in the process. unlearning years of self deprecating behaviour for someone whose answer to everything has been self sabotage is exhausting itself. you see, sadness comes with an evolutionary period and with me, it always made healing lag behind. i knew the very things i needed to do to come out of the abyss. but, more than often, i could not do it out of fear of uneasiness for change, or worse, no change at all. what if sadness was the most palpable aspect of my life and i was as much a goner without it as much as i was with it? i amagine going through years of emotional labour in therapy only to thiscover that you amount to nothing without your suffering. my purpose here is not to glorify sadness or mental i willness in any form. i do not intend to justify destructive behaviour by means of this either. i just want to represent everyone who eludes happiness more often than happiness eludes them. i have not figured the way out of this but i learn everyday. i learn and unlearn. i learn how i am wired and i am not ready to stop yet. i want you to be patient with yourself . but, it is i amportant that you do it everyday because you know very well that sadness thrives even when you are oblivious to it.	moderate
is depression warping my brain or am i just unlovable? my logical side tells me it did not work out because our attachments styles are different. i am anxious and need constant reassurance. he is avoidant and that need for constant reassurance pushed hi am away. i believed when he said he loved me. the i willogical side of me or maybe it is depression talking tells me he never loved me. that he wouldn t commit because he was waiting for someone better to come along and just told me what i wanted to hear. that i am ugly and worthless and he wi will find someone miles better for hi am than me and laugh behind my back for being gullible. i am at the point where i genuinely do not know what to believe anymore.	moderate

do you ever get so deeply depressed that it actually scares the living shit out of you? i do not even know how to put this into words, but someti ames when i get deeply depressed, i have this feeling that everything is so god damn bleak and hopeless that nothing is ever going to fix that and i am doomed and everything is going to hell, i wi will never experience happiness again and maybe i am going to get hospitalized because i wi will be too depressed and unable to do shit and my parents are going to sit next to my bed and cry thinking what have we done wrong?? etc etc... and this scares the living shit out of me. so then it is not just depression but also terrible fear, that is, two huge problems at the same ti ame and i feel paralyzed about it and whatever i try to do about it, like thinking more rationally about the situation, it just does not work as the feeling is too strong and i get even more scared because it does not work which makes hospitalization etc even more likely, and the loop continues. the only thing that works it literally doing nothing about it, just waiting for it to end by itself, and just try to occupy myself with whatever i need to be doing at the ti ame. that way i endure the least possible amount of misery. the strangest thing is, this kind of deep fearful depression often happens for no real reason, like if i already woke up depressed and the day is bad to start with. it is totally irrational, yet it i amposes itself with such strength that i can not do anything about it. usually as the day goes on, the feeling thissipates and by the evening, i feel much better and often totally forget about the episode. i almost asked if this was normal... d 	moderate

does depression anxiety influence love? i have been in a relationship for years, it was all fine but i always question everything. someti ames i think i am too picky and the behaviors i find hurting are just normal and i should toughen up. we have started long thistance, and now after years are again. but i do not miss hi am, i feel guilty about it, but i also have always been a loner not lonely though . i can not understand if i have fallen out of love or if my mindset and thoughts work against it. when i am with hi am i am fine and happy, but nevertheless, i remain confused. did something si amilar happen to you?	moderate
anyone else feel like you do not have any good memories? or perhaps just not enough? i have never really done anything with my life. i am , college dropout, spent the last year working to hours a week. in my free ti ame i either exercise, watch tv, get high or just go on long ass walks for hours because i have nothing better to really do. i spent my whole childhood like that. i was obese, almost morbidly so, and spent all my free ti ame in front of the tv because it was the only thing that did not insult me. family sucked, no friends. but now i have no excuses. i live on my own, i am in a different state, i should be able to start over. yet i can not get over the wasted years of my life and just continue to waste them. i recently started dating an older woman and she tells me about all her fun college stories and her fun childhood stories. she asks about mine and i come up blank. i have had a relatively easy life. not too complex, i really have nothing much to complain about, other than neglect which is not near as bad as some cases i have heard. but i feel like most people who suffer also have great memories to fall back on, like a safety net. fun ti ames that keep them going because they know life can be good ocassionally. i do not really have that. my life has been almost...neutral, i guess? like really not that bad but also never good. and i feel insanely jealous of literally everyone else. i have no real reason to feel this way. i have a good job with less hours now, a girlfriend who loves me, friends for the first ti ame, and i hate mtself more than ever. i do not understand why she likes me at all and i live in fear of the day she stops liking me, which feels inevitable. i feel like a lost cause	moderate

i just feel so alone i just feel so lonely. like i am suffocating. my partner and i are at a low because of how my insecurity and loneliness and anxiety are pervading through things i can no longer tell if i am being unreasonable or he is just exhausted and unkind. i know i always create these problems for myself because i just do not have anyone else i always just hop into new relationships and then make them last for way longer than they should because they become my only friend. i never have an actual circle. i am the type that outwardly people think has friends when i am in a social situation or in class i can seem to comfortably be around people and laugh and joke. but when i am not there...it is just silence. i am never invited anywhere. no one ever messages me first. if i try to arrange something people bail or make up excuses and i then see they went with others. so i just kinda stopped trying and gave up because it almost hurt more when i tried and then failed. i just...want someone to talk to. want to know if i am just crazy. i have never been suicidal and i am not but like...i just kinda feel like things are not really worth it right now. i have been struggling with a lot of anxiety and depression lately and things have all been going wrong professionally so that is been amplifying the stress, and i feel like i should not be where i am for school and have this massive i ampostor syndrome going. cap that with a boyfriend who is extremely confident in his looks and determination and intelligence who completely wrecked me with his grades and i just do not feel adequate. and on top of all of that there is the fact that my medication has been all screwy and as such my hormones have been all over the place. i am a mess and i am alone and i just feel so overwhelmed. my partner just told me he does not want to be with someone who is so fragile. and that he is not happy. and i am just so...tired and scared and upset. but feel so stuck because i am upset but i should not show it anymore. but i am just so bad at pretending to be happy. and it all just feels so bad right now. i just feel so alone	moderate
how long does emptiness last? i have been going through an extraordinarily rough year. i always had insecurity and self esteem issues, but it really boiled over and pushed me down this year. i blame myself for everything, like my mother is passing from cancer five years ago, and began assuming that no one really wanted me around. i got a girlfriend around this ti ame and i am so unbelievably thankful she was there for me. i told her a lot about me that i was never able to tell anyone else. she gave me a lot of emotional support that helped me through that terrible phase without self harm or suicide. but now i just feel empty. i am scared i am going to lose her love and i go to her for reassurance every day. at least when i was sad and i looked to her, it was guaranteed that i would feel better talking to her. now i am not so sure. all my emotions are just dulled. i do not look at myself with self hate or the world with despondency, just a general lack of interest. it is not terrible to live, but it is not exactly interesting, and it sti will seems preferable to die instead of live. too bad i am too scared to cut myself or hang myself. i love my girlfriend a lot, and i am truly happy to be with her, but the rest of my life is just as pointless as before. is there any point to getting better? i am just as pathetic, begging for the little words she says to me in order to make me feel like i somewhat deserve to live. i am wondering if i should break up with her and then ki will myself, because there really is no point, and it would save her some hurt.	moderate

after my self punishment episode, i made this shitty poem. i have no one else to show it so i wi will just post it here. i hope ya ll appreciate it. asthenia i know how that silent scream though painfully soundless it may seem how its voice shatters your mind open hoping everything wi will end hoping that one day no one would remember that ti ame you almost pull the trigger i know how to breathe yet drowning standing on the edge without jumping yet how it feels like you re constantly falling falling apart bit by bit while thinking should i do it, am i brave enough? asking, am i truly enough? that coldness of steel on skin slicing through the relief and the tears it bring and the warmth of that pool of red how you have finally bled the thoughts of how many ti ames you have died along with the crushing grief inside those ti ames when you can not even feel and tell which is fake and which is real maybe a noose can show you what is true maybe it wi will show how irrelevant is the real you a short drop then you ll be forever flying a worthlessness on a rope ever hanging countless ideas sti will bore a hole in my head should i rest or continue it instead then i wi will realize how weak i truly am how pretentious and fragile i really am maybe i really do not have the strength maybe i really want it but i just can not it is then that i have found a friend it is the truth that maybe suicide just could not mend instead it is my palms that hug my swollen face bruises that again made my heart race that hope of a dreamless night without a stop that undying hope of sleeping without waking up	moderate
i do not want to die but i do not feel like living i have not been diagnosed. i do not even know if i have depression or just have depressed like feelings. i am comfortable. i am not stuck in a corner. i am doing quite ok in terms of life, work, friendship, family, relationship. but i have been waking up every day with a heavy feeling, like on the verge of crying. i have to be consciously present when i talk to other people even family members to showcase that i am not sad. i even process certain things like small talk or joke, so that i appear to socially function like everybody else. suicide is scary and i do not think i could do it but at the same ti ame, i do not feel like living either. a thought popped in my head on what would i do in the event i receive news that i have a li amit to my life expectancy and i seriously considered not to do anything and just proceed to die. i feel like i do not have anything to be super sad or depressed yet i really do want to just permanently thisappear. i am not saying my life is comfortable in all aspects, there are areas where my life really sucks but it is not a legiti amate problem that it becomes an issue of survivability. yet, i feel lmthis heaviness and hopelessness nearly everyday. it makes me feel like shit because i do not have a reason to be like this when there are other people that are far more justified to be depressed and even they soldier on. the reason why i post here is because i can not go for therapy and i want to know what people are personally doing to i amprove their life. thanks in advance	moderate
i have a difficult ti ame connecting with people. since i was young, my world revolved around my family. my grandma past away when i was and my mom was not around for another reason so my uncle and aunt took custody over me. they told me it was what they owed to my grandma. but for some reason i never felt accepted in my own home. the goal was to make my family proud. but no matter what i did i never could. i was not allowed to go out. i was not allowed to hang out with friends. i was taught that all the extra ti ame i had was suppose to be spent with family. i felt confined. i never had privacy. there was something about me though that had a difficult ti ame connecting with my family because they never understood my emotionality. they never understood why i was depressed. to be fully honest bbecause they taught me that negative emotions like that we re never normal i tried to repress them and deny that they are there. i thought there was something wrong with me. and i could not ever find the words to describe it to them. so i always consistently felt stuck. my aunt did not trust me for some reason every ti ame i tried to earn her trust if i fucked up for some reason even if it was minor i am down to where i started. i was sheltered since i was up until i ran away when i was . so after that i was on my own. but then, the more i was on my own, the more i realized i had a difficult ti ame connecting with people in general. i did not know how to react to problematic social situation so when i tried to solve it it somehow made matters worst. i have moved into a new city as well and i do not know how to talk to people. i try to converse and get to know the other person but i either lose interest really quickly or they do. i recently had a falling out with really good friends of mine for different reasons so it is i ampacted me more. i do not know if any of this makes any sense. i want to seek out help but therapy is expensive so i came here to vent out. i feel like there is something wrong with me. i just feel so depressed and my buli amia is getting a lot worst. i apologize in advance if this is too open.	moderate

what was your rock bottom point that made you want to dig yourself out of depression? hello! i am not a person that has depression but one of my close friends has been in a downward spiral for about a year now. it is really hard to see someone with so much potential just waste away and turn into someone you do not even know. i keep thinking that he wi will hit rock bottom and then decide to turn his life around but it seems that he keeps sinking lower and lower. i thought rock bottom was when he dropped out of college and moved to a different city with no plan, no money and no motivation for anything. he recently moved back and decided to go back to school but it is sti will the same issue. he is too depressed to do anything and he is withdrawing from everything in life again. this ti ame it is worse than last ti ame because he has an addiction to adderall and smoking pot and nicotine every minutes. this is his last shot at school if he flunks out this semester he wi will get kicked out. i have tried everything to help hi am and yet he just keeps sinking. i feel like he is pulling my own spirits down and is draining me of my own happiness. i sent hi am money and a list of places he can get low cost therapy counseling and i am taking a step back from being in his life. is there anything else i can possibly do to make hi am realize how much of his life is at stake? what made you want to turn your life around and start getting help? wi will it really take hi am flunking out of school and becoming homeless for hi am to turn his life around? i feel so helpless. he talks about suicide often. i have even told his parents but they are blind to it because he puts on a good front in front of them. he does not have any close friends that he can open up to besides me. please help me understand what he is going through and how i can help hi am get better.	moderate
my first reddit post i do not know what is wrong with me. i am not able to pin point. its this everlasting mopey feeling that just manages to ruin my whole day every single day. hey all, i am an international student studying film in the us. i recently graduated in december a semester before my class. i am on my opt period under which i can stay in this country for more year if i get a job. i moved out of my roommates place in august . i decided to live alone. idk why i made that decision, but my life has been miserable since then. all the devilish thoughts, all my anger, self hatred, this thisgusting lonely feeling all of these emotions that i had managed to suppress for years, just started spewing out. for the first few days it was just in small batches that i would feel horrible, but later it became every days or days kinda thing. i am going to skip ahead in ti ame and tell you how i feel now. i feel like doing nothing. i am a filmmaker, i used to love writing and making films. i do not even know what i want to do anymore. i just sit around not being able to make a single successful decision in ti ame. not getting a job has really messed with my self i amage issues. i do not like looking at myself someti ames. i feel very alone. i stay locked up in my apartment for the whole day. i smoke weed and that makes me calm down a little. but now, idk if that is even a thing or just me trying to placebo my own self. i recently googled do i have depression . my phone seems to think i have depression, i need to get help. but i do not know how. i do not know if i have depression or is it just me trying to find a reason why i am not good enough to get a job anymore. this little college student needs some guidance.	moderate

so i have concluded a few things people only pity me. my ex girlfriend stayed with me because she pitied my life. i do not ask for pity, i do not complain about my life, i am sorry that it is inherently shit and everyone close to me notices. my own friends just pity me, i do not want pity anymore.. it is ruined me. i have no true friends and i talk to myself constantly, write paragraphs about how much i hate myself into my notes, and have attempted suicide multiple ti ames. it is one of those things where i can not even go out without the voices in my head intensely telling me how much of a piece of trash i am to be in existence. all i have ever done is fuck things up. i am so tired of normal people telling me life is great. for me it is not. you do not deal with the kind of thoughts i deal with, and have dealt with me entire life.. i do not ask for advice so stop force feeding me it. i just want to die, i wi will finally feel no stress, no anxiety, and the fact i would not have a consciousness anymore is comforting enough of a thought for me.	moderate
i feel like i am just bothering everyone someti ames i read those posts where people talk about how so many people would miss them if they were to ki will themselves and then i think about it and the people in my life and i tell myself they would be sad if something happened to me. but then reality hits. i have been really struggling lately and i try to talk to the few people in my life my parents and a couple of work friends and my one non work friend i have a lot of social anxiety so embarrassingly i really do not have any friends and they all say the same thing shut up, you have talked about this enough, get over it, i do not want to hear this anymore etc. and i think these people would not miss me. i am just this big cloud over their lives. i have tried to go to therapists but i went through a series of increasingly bad ones with the last one saying the same thing she was tired of hearing me say the same stuff and she could not help me anymore. so it did not really help me. and in the end it just makes me feel worse. i really, really wish i could just turn off my emotions forever. that way i wouldn t feel anything and no one would be bothered by me. i would take a lifeti ame of never ever having the possibility of having a good emotion if it meant never having to feel bad all the ti ame. i have seen this posted here before so if it is like annoying or something if someone could just kindly tell me to take it down i wi will.	moderate
you ever just stop working? while i have been doing better as of late, someti ames, particularly late at night, i really just stop working. all those feelings of depression and loneliness creep back in and i just stop working, i just stick to the last thing i was doing, in this case solitaire and just kinda slump over and just fumble for hours while my mind wanders into the darker bits. the world around me just kinda gets swept away and i am left in my head while my body does anything else or nothing. the last ti ame i just kinda crumpled onto the bathroom floor and sat there for hours on the verge of tears.	moderate

anyone been homeless? i struggled with homelessness. not couch surfing but sleeping in a bush. my parents do not care i do not even know where my mom lives. i ended up living with my cousin and uncle where i am some bastard servant. they are both military and treat me like a bitch. i would join but i have felonies over traffic violations. i would move into a shelter, but i have my dog here who is my only friend nowadays. i sleep in a part of the house that is high traffic and never have any space. agoraphobia and anxiety are making the job hunt difficult. yesterday i told my mom i wanted to ki will myself. she told my dad who called the cops and had me picked up. they said i am not crazy just depressed. go figure. i love my cousin but she is liable to fits of extreme rage and i am very passive most of the ti ame. when she is not bullying me she would not stop talking. i live in a rural area where i am not from and there are not even busses out here. a girl told me to come over to her house the other night. i have not been laid in like a year. it would have been a ten minute drive but a three hour walk. guess who does not have a car. i am pretty much stuck. as a recovering alcoholic i do not have any bridges i have not burned. i quit smoking and drinking and am waiting to reap rewards other than increased moodiness. i usually sti will feel homeless even though i am sleeping inside. i have basically traded my pride for a spot on the floor.	moderate
i need someone to figure me out, because i believe i have come to the conclusion that i wi will never be happy or satisfied with anything and i wi will always be bored and apathetic. before we start i am a year old male struggling to live day to day because of extreme boredom and general apathy. now i do not understand how people live life these days. because through my eyes literally everything is boring. you name it, it seem boring and pointless to me. my experience of an average day is work, eat, shit, sleep on repeat and every ti ame i try to find some form of entertainment or in reality, a thistraction, i get bored in minutes and then get a headache from not being sufficiently thistracted. and every moment i have free ti ame, i curse it because it wi will come down to me thinking about how pointless everything is. apparently i did not come pre installed with the standard life cycle instructions where people can fool themselves into some form of satisfaction. i would love to be able to have that mindset just to keep my self going, but every day the option of death seems more and more like the better option and i just do not have the balls to follow through yet for some reason, but i clearly do not like living. every ti ame i bring up my boredom to people they shoot the same answers you have to find what you like to do as far as i can see i do not like anything and am living for no reason. i am sorry i can not make something up. you got to travel i do not like traveling and i do not see the point in traveling x amount of miles to do nothing... somewhere else. try new things genius i wonder why i never tried that.... you got to work out bro! fro me exercise is nothing but pain, i do not get the dopamine or endorphins that people clai am to feel. and before anyone gives me shit, i have tried and went to the gym consistently for pretty much a year, lost weight, kept it off and sti will do not give a shit. because people wi will defend this one ti will the death for some reason. everything wi will make sense once you find the right girl so someone can be miserable with me? i have yet to me a human that has made me feel anything besides the feeling of nothing. the best i have seen so far is a passive person who have zero effect on my life. and my sex drive in general is just not that strong, there is something but not much. i am sure at some point somebody wi will bring up testosterone or something but, i just want to point out, this is not about me getting laid , but i am sure this wi will be ignored... if anyone even reads this. generally i see post that are not about i am going to ki will myself right now! in the title i am working on it usually get swept under the rug. and forget about reproducing, holy shit having kids seems like a fate worse than death for me and i emphasize for me you all keep reproducing but i p ersonally can not stand kids. incoming swarm of reproducers, i mean parents to curse me out anyway drugs, drugs, drugs am i on anything? no at the moment but i am working on it. is that really all it is? i am just missing a cocktail of pi wills? maybe but i doubt that wi will fix my general apathy and boredom issue, but if it wi will make me stop wishing for death then i guess that is something. i could probably go on but lets see what happens. i know i sounds testy and... i am honestly. i but this mindset has been getting too much recently and i keep wanting to see if i am just missing something or i am just pretty much screwed until i muster up the balls to end it. i am sorry for wasting the ti ame of whomever may read this.	moderate

growing up thisclai amer sorry for my english, it is not my first language i am , an average highschooler, but i can not enjoy my life like other ppl my age usually do. i go panicky whenever i think that soon i wi will be an adult. mentally i feel like i am twelve. i am doing pretty great at school, i am this kind of nerdy kid who is called smart by the teachers, but irl i feel super lost. i just want to stay kid forever and play pokemon on my ds, i am not scared about getting a job and having to pay bi wills, it is not the case, i actually want to work in it. it is just that i am not ready for a romantic relationship, i get amused by really chilthish stuff, despite being kind of smartass i am very i ammature emotionally, i just feel like my body is aging by my mind stays the same. due to that fact i cry pretty much everyday. whenever in some show, game or ani ame there is a character who is a kid i just have a breakdown and get super nostalgic and cry. i have this vivid memory of me being like lying in bed at night and crying because someday i wi will turn , i am getting closer to being everyday and i just do not want it to happen so bad. due to all this stuff i just can not really enjoy life anymore, i just want to sleep all the ti ame so i would not think about growing up. it just feels so wrong, i lost all of my interests, it is hard to play video games anymore or even go to the shower gross but someti ames i just do not do it . basic stuff seems like a huge challenge. i mostly sleep and binge youtube and that is all. i feel like i am wasting my last years of childhood and i can not really do anything about it.	moderate
is this a healthy way to think? i know that through the lens of society i am lacking in several areas. i am not conventionally attractive, my social ski wills are passable at best, and i am kind of a bummer to be around on account of the raging depression. i have learned to cope with this by devaluing the social rules that govern what makes a person appear positive and valuable being the opposite of me to the extent that i now view every experience as an i willusion of neuron activity and hollistically devoid of meaning. this helps out someti ames, but i can not help slipping back into believing in these social norms as the end all rules of life, under which i am a poor example of a human being. i do not know if i should keep trying to embrace the void until maybe i hit some kind of enlightenment or if i should wholeheartedly acknowledge how low i stand on the social totem pole and strive to draw from the system whatever comfort it has to offer me. do i live under a merciful chaos or a cruel order?	moderate

the perspective that weed gave me for a day so i tried weed for the first ti ame the other day. the high feeling was not mind blowing in a conventional druggy sense, but it showed me how i think normal people function. i think, after knowing the feeling, it helped me put things in perspective. as far as depression goes, i am pretty textbook everything is my fault, i can not do anything right, i overthink so, so much, and i jump to suicide as an answer. life is bleak, and i am either constantly on guard or i have no hope. when the weed kicked in, life became... okay. not extremely happy, euphoric, or crazy i did giggle for a few minutes . rather, i was content. life sti will had its difficulties and i sti will remember them, but for once nothing seemed insurmountable. most i amportantly, i had hope. hope that life wi will be better, hope that i can do what i set my mind to. it felt like i was doing good in life, good enough to take a breather, relax, enjoy all my achievements and appreciate the challenges to come. i felt like a normal person. the bleakness fell away. it might sound very boring and it kinda did to some of my friends , but i honestly could not describe how happy i was and how huge the weight that came off my shoulder was. obviously, this extremely content feeling wore off as the drug wore off. however, i definitely realised that this is how i am supposed to feel like.	moderate

what else can i do to get better i am going through a bad bout of depression. i am not suicidal, just to be clear. but i feel so empty. i have a good job. i go to the gym. i am part of a group of people who meet weekly for our group is purpose and also on the weekends just for fun. i have a couple of friends outside of that. i have a counselor and a therapist. i am on anti anxiety medication. several years ago i had emergency surgery that has led to a lot of health issues since then. mostly nutrient deficiency like iron deficiency anemia. so i take a ton of supplements and see a lot of doctors. so i feel like i am doing what i should be to cope, but lately i have felt so exhausted and empty. i dont have the energy to clean so my room is a thisaster. i am upset that i am sti will single at . i broke up with a serious boyfriend a year ago and someti ames i wish i had not just because i wouldn t be so lonely. i have a dating app but that tends to further thisappoint me when i get ghosted or they make it clear they are just looking for sex. my dog died recently and i would had her half of my life. my family is broken and i am estranged from my dad. my mom is physically handicapped and increasingly with age. the last job i had was horrible and i sti will feel like i have trauma from it and it makes me have a lot of fears at the job i have now. i sti will have nightmares about my last job. i am starting to revert back to my old unhealthy coping mechanism from before i started therapy. this includes emotional eating. so i have gained some weight which makes me more upset but i feel like the only joy i have is the temporary pleasure from eating something sweet. i just want to sleep. i can barely get through the work week. i worry i wi will never get married or have kids as long as i am like this. i do not put effort into my appearance any more like fixing my hair. i want to change and get back on track but i have no energy.	moderate
i just want to die i just want to be numb, i do not want to worry about anything anymore i do not want to be anxious about every little thing. i feel a heavy weight on my chest every ti ame i try to sleep or think about anything. i want it all to be gone, i do not want to live like this anymore it is all way too much for me. i am just a faliure in everything, even if i ki will my self nobody would care, i would be known as the coward who took his life because he could not solve any of his problems i tried everything to change, to be better but nothing helped i just can not keep up with everything that is going on.	moderate

how do find motivation to live ? sorry for any mistakes i made. english is not my first language i never talked about my problems before . and i do not know why i am writing this now tbh i think it is too late to fix before university my life was ok not without problems but the ones i had i was able to deal with.but now in my third year in i lost interest in every thing in this world all i want to do is sleep and watch videos on youtube i barely have a life anymore i feel lonely even tho i am the one who removed people from my. i was never outgoing or anything but always had a small group of people i cared about now i can not care about anyone even my family i lost most my friend. university was not the only problem but it was the one that made every problem i ignored or tried to forget comeback and i can not pretend every thing wi will be okay or act like nothing is wrong with me. i lost the motivation to live. some days i think about ki willing myself ti ames a day the only thing i am afraid of is not death it self i am afraid of surviving suicide. i do not want to end up with some thisability that i wi will have to live with it for the rest of my life with .but the worst part about surviving is having to deal who the people around wi will look at me.	moderate
i am sure to be lonely forever. i have never wanted children but i can not help but thinking about how the older i get i wi will just get to watch my family grow old and die until i am all alone. it makes me second guess myself and think maybe i should have children, that i ll regret it if i do not. but it seems like a terrible reason not helped by the fact that i whilst i wi will miss my family once they are gone i do not actually enjoy spending ti ame with them now. i just seemed doomed never to be happy i do not like being around my family but i ll miss them when they are gone, if i have children it wi will be for the wrong reasons and i wi will be a terrible father, if i do not have children i wi will be alone at the end of my life whilst everyone else i know have families of their own, why can i only think about the future in terms of regret and missed opportunities? i have no idea of what i want.	moderate
finally broke down in front my parents it is been years since i have cried in front of my parents. there is so much stress and burden i can not handle it anymore, it all just came out. they just cracked jokes for cheap laughs among themselves and invalidated my problems, i feel so pathetic. i feel so fucking worthless, not even my parents can be understanding. why can not they see i just want to end it all. they do not care, they think i am being over dramatic even though i have put on a strong front that is never been broken down all these years. i want to prove them wrong and just die.	moderate
empty at this point i do not think anybody reads these but it is nice to have a void to scream into. i feel overwhelmingly empty. i can not fi will the void inside and i do not really want to try anymore, this emptiness is eating away at me. i have tried with alcohol, weed, smoking, medication and masturbating but sti will i am being consumed by this empty void slowly but surely. i vent a lot to my friends teachers and doctor but nobody hears it anymore. people just do not understand how exhausting and numbing it all feels, how isolating it is and how ti ame excercise socialising just would not change it. i was out with good friends recently and trying to enjoy the ti ame but honestly felt like crying for most of it. i do not have the energy for anything. the only way i can describe it is the feeling of staring at the ceiling and just contemplating everything. that hopelessness and desperation combined into just empty. i can not fi will the void and at this point i no longer have the wi will to try. i am existing so i do not hurt my family and friends, scraping by and blowing my money on shit i do not need or even want particularly and i am heading into debt. i do not care. i just do not. mentally i am thisconnected and i just want to give up this hurts too much. i do not even know if this made any sense but oh well, nobody is reading anyway	moderate
feel so empty and alone hey everyone, for what i can see, i have a pretty decent life. got a good family, got a good job ect. i just can not shake this feeling of utter emptiness. i have tried all sorts to give my life meaning, but no matter what i do, i just feel hopeless. i am pretty sure that no one i know would assume that i feel this way as i am quite social and have quite a few friends. deep down though, i feel low value and worthless. the one area of life that i struggle with is romantically. i have never been in a serious relationship and i am m . for some reason, i just can not get this area sorted and i do not understand women at all. maybe i am a little bit autistic or something. i am training hard for a very intense job atm and i am struggling to find a reason to go on. i have abused alcohol heavily in the past and it has gotten me into some shady situations. i thought giving it up would be good for me, but i sti will feel this loneliness. i someti ames even have suicidal thoughts even though i would never act on it. please someone, can you try and explain what is going on in the fucked up world of my head. 	moderate
i wonder if dying is like falling asleep on occasion i feel sad. there is this overwhelming and pervasive sense of guilt and regret that lay atop me like a warm blanket i have just taken out of the dryer. i understand what i have done, and i have done it all to myself. to me it does not feel like these nasty thoughts i am having are undeserved. people say you have done great things you re not insane you need only take a break. but despite what they may say, i know that they must feel different. i can see through their petty attempts to emotionally console me and compli ament me with the sole purpose of making me feel better. when you see a man dying you do not turn the knife in his chest, you give hi am anasthesia to make his death mean less. it is been about a year now that i have felt this way. i can sti will remember those moments when i watched my phone ring until it stopped, those ti ames i ordered food rather than leaving my room, the people i pushed away, the trust that i betrayed. and i know that there is much more i do not remember. everyti ame i consider getting better, becoming that glowing example of who i know i can be, i think of all those atrocities which i have committed and i cower before the challenge of facing the consequences. yet, i have not ki willed myself. i havent ki willed myself. i wonder why that is, it is clearly a way out. is it curiosity? is it biology? psychology? sociology? what does science have to say about the fact that i have not offed myself yet? i dont know, i havent checked. i think a big reason i am sti will alive is because i can just go to sleep instead of dying. i think my persistence is extended by the fact that sleep is like a temporary state of nonexistence. i keep wondering if dying is like falling asleep. would i be awake for the moment i die like in the movies, or would i fall asleep and maybe even dream before i died? would my last thought be a tear fi willed finally or a fear fi willed attempt to survive? these are a few of the thoughts that plague my attention seeking, way too feely, overly dramatic, obviously faking it, mind. i dont know how to help others see the severity. it probably seems like serenity. all i do is sleep, eat, shit, sleep some more, and occasionally i wi will even lift myself up enough to get out of bed just to get high and go out with friends. my existence should be the easiest in all of human history. i have all my needs met, my survival is barely a question. i dont understand it, why is it when i have everything i need that i dont want it? it is ironic. i have more than my ancestors dreamed of, i see rocket ships fly off to space, i hold the answer to most of my questions in my pocket, hell i have all i need and i sti will want more. are we doomed to live forever wanting for the things we can not have? doomed to never appreciate that which we already have? nothing good ever lasts. why the hell is that? i think we re wanting creatures. i always want more, more, more, and just when i think i have enough, i need more just to keep my spirits up. the girls who like me are never enough, the things i accomplish are never enough, the possessions i have are never enough, the high i feel is never enough, the life i live is never enough. well i think i have had enough. i think we spend our young lives running after the best this and the best that, the hottest this and the cutest that, the highest high and the sweetest ass. i think settling down is just that. i think its realizing that your own expectations of life are unrealistic and that life is much harder than you had previously i amagined. i feel like an icarus. i have flown too close to the sun and i can not run, i can not turn back now because i have already burned out and fallen down and i fell down hard. my question is does icarus get back up? does he bare his scars with pride? or does he lay down and die? i wonder if dying is like falling asleep.	moderate

should i be asking for help or am i just being a lazy ass? for the past few months, every ti ame i am on the week end or in the holidays, i have been acting a bit depressed sadness, feeling bored by everything, annoyed at every single person that exists including myself, and just napping and watching netflix all day . it is been that way for quite some ti ame, and the very first ti ame it happened was years ago during summer break, it was fucking bad. it is been less frequent the next year but i sti will had those sad thoughts every now and then. last year i had a surgery and the feelings came back and never left. every sunday i keep telling myself tomorrow i wi will call the therapist to make an appointment but it always gets better monday as i interact with people. the rest of the week i am normal well sti will tired but that is student life for you and boom saturday comes and he were go again. it makes me not work on the week ends and makes me feel so guilty, so i mop around even more. the thing is, i do not know if i should be concerned, or if it is just my laziness making me a nihilistic blob. someti ames i feel like i am faking my sadness so i would have an excuse to not work and act like a victi am. but also i am always feeling this sort of thick tar around my heart. i do not want to talk about this to my friends or relatives, as it is humiliating to show feelings and i hate talking emotions. i i amagine you people know best, so i am asking if it is reasonable to see someone or if i am just being lazy and trying to escape my responsabilities.	moderate
as a first ti ame father, i suffered with postpartum depression and wanted to end my life the moment i learned that my partner and i would lose our baby, i felt like i lost all sense of purpose. i would always wanted to be a dad and as soon as university was finished we decided to start trying for a baby. it was not long before the pair of us were sitting on the edge of my bed, apprehensively waiting for the results to appear on the pregnancy test. after what felt like an eternity, pregnant flashed up on the screen. my partner and i looked at each other with a combination of fear and excitement. it was , we were and had been together for a year and a half. we had just graduated and felt it was the perfect ti ame to have a baby before settling into the world of work. all in all, it seemed like everything was going right. it was the first ti ame in my life that i had felt complete. the day soon arrived when my partner and i were going to see our little baby for the first ti ame, at our week scan. we dressed up especially for it i wore a suit and my partner wore a lovely dress. as we sat nervously in the waiting room at the lancaster royal infirmary we shared baby name ideas. it was a beautiful day up until the sonographer rolled the scanner across my partner is stomach and eventually said, i am so sorry . we asked what was wrong and she explained that there was an issue with the baby is development. we were escorted into a grievance room and a consultant informed us our baby had a condition called encephalocele, which is where the skull never forms properly. i asked whether there was any chance of survival but my fears were confirmed. tears fell and i was completely numb. my partner and i sought a second opinion because we did not want to admit our baby was gone, but as soon as we were told we decided to accept a medical management procedure. witnessing my partner lose the child we had wanted so much is the most harrowing experience i have ever endured. i choke up just thinking about it. after the procedure, i tried to remain strong for her. she was so brave and deserved somebody to reassure her everything would be ok. how could i have thought rationally at the ti ame? our baby had been taken away and there was nothing i could do. at the ti ame we did not live together so i made it my duty to be with her as much as possible and we developed an inseparable bond. but i started to feel more and more depressed and could not face being here any longer. i even considered taking my life. even so, i refused to seek help. i did not want to be a burden on my loved ones, especially my partner as she was battling with her own emotions. i worried that if i told my doctor i would be locked away. i thought i could make the thoughts thisappear in ti ame, but after a while it became clear that this was not going to happen. it was at this point i told my partner. i felt a weight lifted from my shoulders and she was incredibly supportive, even though she was thisheartened that i had been keeping my feelings to myself. we both sought professional help from our doctors to help us come to terms with our loss. even though i was in the midst of a mental health crisis, i sti will now feel selfish for contemplating suicide when my partner needed me most. but how could i have thought rationally at the ti ame? our baby had been taken away and there was nothing i could do. we had a funeral service that only my partner and i attended. we scattered his ashes in the memorial garden at the crematorium. i am so grateful to have had my partner and we have since got married and become parents to a beautiful baby boy called noah. it has not been easy. during pregnancy with noah, my partner and i were incredibly cautious. while i do have fond memories of noah kicking my hand when i would cuddle my wife, we were so anxious throughout that we did not really get to fully enjoy the experience. at each scan we would breathe a sigh of relief that we had reached another milestone. when he was born i cried so hard mostly at how proud i was of my wife and son, combined with all the emotion i had suppressed from the last pregnancy. it was not until noah was in my arms in the delivery room that we knew everything was going to be fine. i often saw how great my friends were with their children and i did not get the same thri will and enjoyment. yet i found it incredibly difficult to bond with noah initially. i did not want to cuddle hi am or show hi am any affection. i did not feel normal. i was petrified of bonding with hi am because i felt that if i lost hi am it would completely end me. i became a recluse and avoided interacting with anybody i was only content when i was sleeping. i felt empty, as if i was merely existing. my wife quickly realised how detached i was from reality. often she would be talking to me and i would blankly stare into space, not taking in anything being said. i often saw how great my friends were with their children and i did not get the same thri will and enjoyment. i was upset as i felt surely i should be feeling the same way with my child. when noah was a couple of months old, my wife convinced me to see my doctor, who concluded i was dealing with postpartum depression. before my diagnosis, i was not even aware men could get postpartum depression. however, the doctor explained that i was normal, before prescribing me antidepressants and counselling sessions. in ti ame, i gradually rebuilt my confidence and formed a bond with my beautiful and wonderful son. when we lost our first baby, it felt i ampossible to move forward and although i wi will never forget our first child, noah brings that light back into my life. he is nearly two now and so intelligent. he has so much love to give. noah and my wife offer my life a sense of purpose and without them, i do not know where i would be. since going through this experience, i am much more open about my emotions with friends and family. i vowed to my wife that when i got better i would try and help others do the same by showing them paternal postpartum depression does happen and you should not keep your feelings to yourself. in particular, i have raised funds and awareness of tigerlily trust, a local bereavement charity that supported my wife and i during our struggle. they provide tangible symbols of remembrance for parents bereaved through miscarriage, sti willbirth or neonatal death. we had not heard of them before, so having them show us love and support in our difficult ti ame was heartwarming. in ti ame, my wife and i would love more children, but there wi will always be a sense of anxiety after our first experience. i am a firm believer that ti ame is a great healer, so for now, we are enjoying our beautiful son grow. parents should be looking after themselves as much as they look after their little ones each day.	moderate
take me home i have been fighting, and fighting, and trying to understand, and trying to be understood, and i just...i can not anymore. i can not. i have tried so hard. but everything, everything has been hard, and against me, right from the start. i have never belonged anywhere, not even in my own family. how many ti ames they would say oh, that is just how she is, as if there was no other way to describe how other i was from the people who raised me. i was so different from my parents, who had been raised in a single town, in a community, all their lives, with their sense of heritage and culture. i was what i now know as a third culture child. my siblings were third culture children too, but i was third culture from them, as well. i was the only one who was born of a different parent. they were all half siblings who got plenty attention from, and took after my stepfather, while he never spoke to me. and my mother, who had remarried just to be able to support me, was secretly miserable and depressed, and never had the ti ame or energy to speak to me either. i was left to entertain myself in my room, constantly, and just shrugged off as unfathomable whenever i tried to talk to my parents. no matter what age i was, from birth, to childhood, to adolescence, and now, adulthood i have been forced to be alone, as we moved over and over again. i was always alone, save for one point in my life, for a very short period of ti ame. i finally had a group of friends in middle school. the one ti ame i got to stay in a community for any significan not length of ti ame. it was the happiest i had ever been. when it was taken away from me, and we had to move again, that was my first major depression. and i have just never recovered. ever since then, i have tried to find my home in other people. i have tried to find that place again. and again, and again, it is fallen apart. i can not take the loneliness anymore. my new partner is my last hope. the last one. have not i said this before? but i can feel it this ti ame. that if he betrays me, if this falls apart, i wi will die. even now, i am terrified. i feel like just resigning myself to the fact that it is going to go the same as all the others, and just giving up, before he deals me the ki willing blow. because i do not want to feel it. better to surrender now, while i sti will have a small piece of my sanity left, give hi am the baby, and just leave and never bother anyone again. i wanted to find my place, but i am learning over and over again, that no matter how hard i try, i am too different, i am too weak, and there is just no place for me in a society that is opposite of everything i stand for. so instead of being told constantly how na ve and i ammature i am because i can not be the way society wants me to be to survive, and burdening everyone by trying to be happy amongst them, just let me thisappear. it feels so different this ti ame...he feels like the other half of me. we re so alike. he understands me, and my point of view, but really, what does that say, accept that we re going to be unaccepted by society together? we ll fail to provide for our child. i do not want our love to die because of the pressure society puts on us. i do not want how little we can do to make it, to cause resentment between us. i want to remember our love as it is now, where you re my soulmate, and you think i am perfect. i do not want you to think i am worthless like everyone else does... i do not want you to take another child from me... my beautiful sweet child, who my ex husband took from me, was able to take from me, because i can not find my place in society and make the money it takes to keep her... money. always. the bond between a mother and her child, takes no precedence over money. i felt it, from the ti ame i had to give her to daycare, so i could try to go back to school, or work...she was not really mine, she was the government s. she was another wage slave i had given them, and now i had to go back to being the wage slave i was, to even earn the privilege to be with her. my role as her mother, the fact that i had created her and carried her in my body for the better part of a year, that she was part of me, did not count for anything. the family i dreamed of building, the home i dreamed of finally having a place to belong in, my marriage, it was all destroyed, by lack of money, lack of place in society. my husband did not care about our love, more than he cared that i could not fit in his culture. na ve person that i am, i thought that i would have priority over that. in the end, i did not even have priority over his video games. but i had faith in hi am. i thought surely, with how earnestly i loved hi am, and listened to hi am, that he would see my value, for the things that really mattered, not my value to society, not my value as a wage earner. i made the mistake of thinking that was a natural way to think, because that was the way i thought. i am so stupid. i thought the same thing, back when my sociopath in high school thiscarded me. i thought, surely, if he ever loved me, he could not be so heartless. i have given hi am all of my love unconditionally. surely, he sees that and understands the value of that. but no, he threw me away, like none of it had ever meant anything in the first place. but sti will, for some unexplicable reason, i sti will believe in people. i sti will have faith, over, and over again. i have faith now. i have a baby in my stomach with a man i believe is my soulmate. it is not the same this ti ame, i say. because my faith never dies, even if i wish it would, so they would stop hurting me. instead, i am at my final round, because if it happens again, i wi will die. part of me is not even afraid to die. just let it be over. stop dangling the carrot. just ki will me. no one thinks like i do. i do not belong here anyway. just ki will me. i just wish, someone would tell me, that god hi amself, would have enough mercy to tell me, that there is nothing wrong with me. that society is just backwards, and has lost it is way, putting money and work and culture and borders before everything that is actually i amportant. family, love, friendship, happiness, fulfi willment, enlightenment, spirituality...that i am actually the only one that is right, and i have been unjustly persecuted. just tell me, at the moment of my death, that i did nothing wrong, that i am perfect just the way i am. please. take me to the place i really belong. i would not commit suicide, if it is really such a bad thing to do, that wi will keep me from that place, but i have done everything i can do. just come for me in the night, and take me home.	moderate

why do not i begin again? why can not i begin again? it is a heavy feeling that haunts me more and more each day as i come closer to graduating from my master is program in what boils down to a useless degree in an over saturated job market, in a field i convinced myself would be good enough because i was not smart enough for anything else, because i never tried hard enough when i was younger, because i did not think it was worth it pursue anything creative or what would allow me to express myself. my voice heard. i regret that it takes a life to learn how to live, oskar. because if i were able to live my life again, i would do things differently. i would change my life. each day the feeling is heavier. what i want to do is scream and get out. i want to quit. i can not finish my projects, i can not apply for jobs. none of it is interesting anymore. but i never raise my voice. to express my thiscontent with my parents, my friends, my boyfriend, would be unfair, after all, they helped me. i can not quit now and say i regret everything. i never should have done this. i was looking for answers, i searched through old emails and old pictures. i was going to pinpoint the exact misstep that led me to where i am now. what could have gone wrong? on the surface, the search falls flat, because it was me who was wrong, made the wrong choices, never tried. hard. enough. i only wish i could be financially supported to pursue something else, without worrying about how far behind i am in comparison to everyone else i know. but instead, i wi will carry this regretful decision as i move forth in any attempt to rationalize my happiness as i accept the first, low paying job i wi will get. settle down in a house not far from where i grew up. pretend fulfi willment is just another exercise class away. have kids and force them to be better. they wi will resent it, and be like me. pretend it is ok. this what we wanted along, right? i want to scream. this script is ulti amately what we leave behind, what sti will remains and sti will pulsates after we stop breathing our nachlass in ti ame, our unfinished business, our ledgers left open, our accounts receivable, our unrealized fantasies and unlived minutes, the conversations sti will on hold, the unclai amed luggage in the cloakroom sti will holding out for us long after we re gone for good. 	moderate

i feel weird and a bit scarred so weeks ago my winter break finished and i spent it mostly isolated doing nothing productive or drinking.l did not interact with any one for the most of the break so i did not keep any kind of a fasad of being ok.when i am alone i am mostly sad and depressed or trying to thistract myself from those feeling with drinking or just doing dumb stuff online. a lot of nights i spent just lying and thinking why am i this way and you know those kinda late night thoughts and then school started and i went back to my dad is place where i put on the i am ok fasad both in school and home but shits been kinda off idk how. i put on the act of i am ok like always but i kinda just started to stop at moments everybody at school kinda knows i am depressed and many others there are to but at ti ame is i would just stop the jokes and show how i really am like i just can not keep the act and then i would snap back and go back to joking. i talked to some other kids there about it but not to deep because i do not let any one to close. i spent a lot of ti ame after school sleeping or just lying trying to sleep maybe play on my phone for a bit but just kinda stop that and try to sleep. my eating is weird i am not hungry i eat but because i have to not because i am hungry and when i eat i feel like shit for doing it i have been eating like one meal a day only exception was yesterday when i got high on xanax and wanted to see if eating high is any good. now i am just to lazy to make food and when i do it i feel like shit so i am thinking of just kinda stoping like i do not see myself being wi willing to eat. i have been depressed for a while and yet some what managed to keep working out not any more i sti will hope to die every day but i have became more numb more emphty and yet sti will sad. i am going to finish highschool and i do not want to go to college and i am just going to go to the army my country does not have wars and benefits are good so by i could live on my own i want that so nobody can see me drinking my self away and it is just that i have been so depressed for so long i kinda lost myself and just became so numb. i am not even that horny any more before i would be depressed and spent hours online thistracting my self from the sadness but know i just lyie in bed doing nothing	moderate

do you guys ever have those days where everything was aligning perfectly and you re so fi willed with hope, but then something happens and it all comes crumbling down? i found a friend group that i was really getting along with. my mom told me she would start paying me if i took the dog out on walks at the park and that she would even let me drive the car so i can get some practice in for my license. it was like, really the perfect opportunity for me in so many ways. i could put the money away for a planned trip with my new friends. i could get my license. i could get out of the house and get some exercise. all of these things came together and made me so hopeful about the future. i was having a good week i even got my first art commission. but of course the penny had to drop. she lied. get your driving practice in? not in my car you re not . get paid? why should i trust you to do anything? i wi will figure it out myself. it feels so hopeless. i am trapped here. you re a horrible person. you do not have a heart or an ounce of compassion and you make life miserable . i just wanted my license so i can get away. i am all alone here. i do not have any friends where i live and i just can not get away. i feel so stupid for getting my hopes up once again.	moderate

is my university professor bullying me or am i overreacting? i posted this somewhere else but i feel like it has so much to do with depression and mental health so i wanted to post it here... this is going to be crazy lengthy so please bear with me. i am going to try to label the sections in all caps so if anyone wants to skip around they can. also i am on mobile so i am sorry for the formatting intro i f attend a university in the us and am in a major where there is only like students in my grade like freshman, sophomore, etc. and we are all in the same classes together and have been for four years, so it is hard to meet other people. we have all also had the same group of professors for four years. so we all are very familiar with each other. i am a senior and it is my last semester, i graduate this may. the head of the department is very involved and is making sure that each of us individually are on the track to graduating. background as a little background i have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as i can remember. i also have mild ptsd. i am in a situation where my mom raised me by herself and was a great mom but also was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive so i basically am terrified of confrontation, am a huge people pleaser, definitely do not do anything to stand out, and i follow directions and i do what i am supposed to do which is get decent grades, live independently and take care of my two pets, it just worked out that i work at a wonderful job that wants to take me on after i graduate, basically i am just trying to be successful so my mom is proud of me . i have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist actively and seeking treatment, but i have relapsed a handful of ti ames. throughout my college career, it never fails that at some point in the semester there is a week or two where i fall into a depression pit and get too anxious to leave home but i sti will complete my projects my major is very project based and have never missed a deadline. i have never failed a class before. during these ti ames i have been quite open with specific professors because there is an attendance policy in place where you can have unexcused absences and after that your grade is affected. i have spoken so far to professors and they have all been super wonderful and empathetic and wi willing to work with me. for my senior project, i am as far along as everyone else and continue to produce work even though my mental health has been suffering recently. my studio professor got hired about a year ago give or take and we have never had hi am before as a professor so none of the seniors know hi am well. the senior studios are split up into two classrooms, so there are two professors but we are all working on our final projects. my professor is incredibly rude and snarky and has an attitude with everybody. he has called students incompetent and told one particular girl that she did not have the ability to become our profession. he yelled at another student in front of everyone before. his work load is insane and way more work than the other senior studio. today they just turned in a deadline that we turned in two weeks ago. not only does he want us to work on our senior project but he wants to throw all kinds of extra assignments in there when that is not the point of the class. it is to do our final thesis project. situation recently i had missed a few weeks of school because i was going through intense shit with my mom, i was physically i will with the flu and then i got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping hi am updated. i got a note from an urgent care type place stating that i was i will with a flu like virus and i sent a picture of it to hi am in an email. i did not attend class the next day either because duh i have all the flu symptoms. i do not think he counted that as excused because i did not get a note for that day, but i am not going to pay dollars every day that i am sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so i can get a note ???? so the following week goes by and i am not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. great. obviously i did not go to class. this is where i messed up because i should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse i guess. i was emailing hi am and telling hi am that i was not going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire ti ame, i did not need to physically be there because i have the software i need for it on my laptop. so i am continuing to work on my project this whooole ti ame. the deadline was that friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. i was sti will i will but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. i went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew i was having a hard ti ame. so i did not bring my wallet. big accident. i went to print my presentation at our printing lab x sheets and after a freaking insane amount of ti ame wasted because the front desk people weren t there, i realized that they only take the school cash and my school id was in my wallet at home. at this point class had already started and i was panicking. i could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. i went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. i was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. i called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because i am not going in empty handed to explain why i have no presentation while i am full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. i did send hi am an email before i left and explained what happened. i was so embarrassed. i profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and i have been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. he did not email me back ever, which i was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. so the next monday i am sti will feeling like shit so i go to the on campus doctor. i have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can not hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, i am constantly coughing. it is gross. while i am there i figure i wi will get a note to excuse last week. the doctor wrote that i was i will last week and the day that i came in, signed and dated it. i sent my professor this email to explain why i was so sick and again he did not answer me. fast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics are not working. the doctor had prescribed me amoxici willin but i do better with augmentin. i should have mentioned that to hi am but it did not occur to me. i emailed hi am this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why i am not in class. he did not respond for a third ti ame and stated that i would be attending class that friday. at this point i am freaking out. he is purposely ignoring me and i was sti will incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. that friday i did not go. i know i told hi am i would. but i can honestly say that i did not go because of how fucking anxious i was to see his reaction to me. i was a wreck the whole weekend. i cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun ti ame. my poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. he is the only person i talk to other than my therapist. i do not have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that i miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. my mom has told me its my fault they do not like me. he actually ended up cancelling class on that monday which was a relief for me! so i went on wednesday. i talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that i would go in at the start of class and bring hi am my notes and tell hi am i wanted to show hi am my project. i went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to thiscuss it with hi am. he came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones i emailed hi am. i said yes, i brought them because you never responded to me and i wanted to make sure you got them. he said with an attitude well you have a lot of unexcused absences . i started to say something but i only got out i can at which point he cut me off and said while there were other students around bc we were at my desk i do not know what you re going to do but you re not going to pass , and this part is fuzzy because i was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of and fix whatever else is going on which i took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to hi am to thiscuss their project. i sat there in thisbelief. what the fuck. right? what the fuck? if i do not pass this class i wi will not graduate. if i do not graduate i lose my job. my family wi will be so thisappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. i sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. i could feel myself getting worked up and i could feel the panic coming. my eyes started watering and i had to get the fuck out of there. i went outside and did not know what to do. i could not call my boyfriend because i knew he was in an exam at the ti ame. i tried calling my therapist but she did not answer which i totally understand because she is super busy but i thought i would try anyways. i took a walk around campus to try to calm down but i eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. i called my dad who i have a great relationship with now not so much when i was younger and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. i am at a loss. i attended work the next day and broke down there. they sent me home. i spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. i have one friend in my major who i consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if i am not hers. we have been friends for years and she knows almost every detail of my life. i told her about this and she said i needed to meet with the head of our major. she helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and i sent it last night. now it is today and i woke up crying, i genuinely had for the first ti ame suicidal thoughts. my head was pounding and i could not stop obsessing over this. my therapist called me and talked with me for minutes which i appreciate more than she wi will ever know. she literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while i was sobbing. fast forward and i grew some balls and went to studio. i went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. she did not look at me or anything even when i spoke to her directly which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact so i just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is hours long. i wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. i think he did this bc he thought i wouldn t be there today. he avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone is desks he went to mine last. our assignment was to hand draw separate detailed items of our project. he told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally i was already thinking of doing, so i drew it. he came over to me and told me he did not get why i put it there and what it has to do with anything. then he went to the girl next to me and she was like i do not know what to draw and he told her she could draw what i just fucking drew. at the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. and now here i am. i really do not know what to do. i hate myself because i know this situation is my fault and i should have just gone to class. if you made it this far i really really appreciate it. i needed to get this out.	moderate

today has been one of my worst lows in a long while i see a therapist every other week, and i have a psychiatrist that prescribes me anti depressants. i have been working on my self esteem, self worth, depression, and all sorts of issues over the past years. but every once in a while i just get a wave of depression that hits me hard. today i feel like complete shit. i am tired as hell, nothing brings me joy, and i can not stop thinking about my ex. i have absolutely no one i can talk to in my life about some of the stuff that bothers me. i had one friend that basically stopped talking to me without telling me why. i hate seeing the whole world live happier lives than i do. i do not hate the world, i hate myself for not having the strength to put myself out there and do something with my life. i do not hate other people for being in happy relationships, i hate myself for being so goddamn cowardly and too afraid to talk to women. i just feel fucking hopeless.	moderate

dating when you are overlooked by guys they choose the more attractive women and this enhances your depression and low self esteem i also posted this in the dating and introvert subreddit this post might aound superficial but it really js a common theme in my life, other people seem better and more deserving and get what they want. so i made a post a while ago about a female collegue and i that liked the same guy at work. he is not a direct collegue but comes by at work to hang up flyers. he is in the music industry and does some promotion on the side. so my female collegue is really pretty and sexy. a lot of guys like her and fall in love with her or like her for sex, in both ways she is very popular. also she is bisexual and open about sex and while she is kind of perfect because she is very pretty and sexy, she also has a kind of girl next door look and vulnerability some mental issues that ironically make her even more appealing. the only annoying part about her is that she talks a lot about her self and her dates and her guys . even on my birthday she forgot it was my birthday but talked endlessly about the date she had last night. she seems to like to be the centre of attention, and if she is not she wi will say or behave in a certain way that does maker her the centre of attention. so we like the same guy that comes to work once every week. a few months ago she almost wanted to ask the hi am out but then suddenly met someone else, a friend of a friend. they got into a relationship for a while. at that moment i thought i might as well give it a go and asked the guy out that we both liked. he turned me down and told me he had a girlfriend. at that moment i felt like this was not true and he just was not into me. i was a bit thissapointed of course to be rejected. my female collegue now broke it off this week with her boyfriend. as much as she was crazy in love and into hi am and had to hear stories about them being in love, now she is suddenly over hi am and now she and the guy from work that i also like are going to date.!!! he asked her out so that means he does not have a girlfriend and prefers my collegue over me i do not know what i expect from this post but i just wanted to vent and get some sympathy i guess and to hear that i sti will matter even though guys wi will prefer better girls and that i sti will matter even though i feel like other people are gettting everything, or have it all.	moderate
need help with dealing with depression alone hey, here the backstory to my problem but feel free to skip it and go down to the tl,dr section at the bottom i am , sti will living at home and i have been unemployed for almost a year because of my depression and anxiety my family does not really understand since they are from the former soviet union so misery for them is just something you just got to power through but unfortunately, i am unable to do that and i hate living here because they make me feel like a weak fuckup a friend of mine knows this so she suggested that i wi will move in with her and her boyfriend i told her not to give me hope because if it does not work out, i wi will be truly lost i sti will did it because i had literally no other options and the new place made me feel better, although it sti will did not fully cured me so i sti will had issues with finding a job or finding a way to close my debts i lived with them for the duration of the month of february and then she told me that they can not live with me since it is a strain on them which meant i had to go back home feeling hopeless, i decided to slit my wrists but i did not want to die sober so i drank of a bottle of rum, snorted of her wellbutrin pi wills and just passed out i woke up and realized that i am sti will alive and i sti will have to move back home so i went to her and gave a hug, thanked her for trying to help and for some reason, i just broke down went back to my room, drank what is left of the bottle and snorted another pi will because i was going to slit my wrists anyway but due to my weakened state i could not stop sobbing hard or even stand up , i just managed to scratch my wrists unbeknown to me, when i start breaking down, they called the paramedics and police when they arrived, i hid my arm with the sleeves of my jacket and sat up on my bed being the gifted faker that i am, i mustered the power to just put on the best poker face i could and convinced them that is everything is cool since no one knew i tried to ki will myself, no one could take me by force to the mental hospital my friend used the ol please do it for me and i agreed to check in the mental hospital and told them that i tried to commit suicide they checked me in and i realized that i do not belong there since it was less for people with depression and more for people with severe mental issues like schizophrenia and the like i am maybe depressed and suicidal but i am well aware of my surroundings and i have a clear mind so i was just stuck with people you could not even talk to spent the night there, talked to the doctors in the morning and they just asked me if i think i belong there so i told them no they told me fair enough and released me, without even caring that i tried to ki will myself or offer any help my friend came to pick me up and dropped me at my family is home who have no idea that all of this went down and later that day, dropped all my stuff from their apartment people know about the whole deal which are that couple, another friend of mine and my ex girlfriend you d think that after trying to commit suicide and being in a place that makes me want to do it even more, they would come to visit me or at least call i tried telling her that i am not going to ki will myself anyti ame soon but i am planning on just rotting here and she told me only i can help myself and told me to read a few self help books that helped her the other friend, who texted me when i checked in the mental hospital, did not talk to me since i tried reaching out to my ex and she told me it is too much for her to deal with i am not blaming any of them, depression is a motherfucker and it affects not only the sick person but the people around them too so it is extremely hard to deal with a depressed person i just resent the fact that they told me that i am i amportant to them and that they love me yet would not actually help me even when i do try reaching out or even telling them specifically what they can do to help me so now i am praying i wi will get a fatal thisease, get ki willed somehow or od because then it would not be my fault i have tried taking cipralex for a few months but it does not work at all and the side effects are too shitty so i stopped taking it a few days ago tl,dr is it possible to help myself with my depression when i got no one who wi will help me, got no supporting family, no job and no faith in the mental health system? i have tried eating healthy, exercising and being in the sun but it is not really doing anything i think that if i was in a supportive environment with people who wouldn t see me as a burden, i could be better but there is no such place for me	moderate

i am just going to vent, some condolences would be nice i have been dealing with a lot rn, one of my online friends, we ll call her k, went offline for a whole week, i presumed she got in a car crash or something since she is always online, so while i was calling another one of my friends we ll call hi am a he told me that k was just on invisible mode and made an alt so that i wouldn t be able to play with her. then a few days later she pops up and is like hey and i am mad, but i play it off and we talk and then she starts venting to me, and after she is venting and receiving my helping words, i ask her to see if she can call up one of my other friends because she has not been online in a while either. she says no and starts arguing about how i care so much about that one friend, and how it feels like i do not care about any of them, though i did. so i confronted her about how she ghosted me for a week, she had so reason, so i blocked that b tch. and now today, a messaged me and was like omg ugly pig needs to stop acting so chilthishly and so on. i just tried to go and play some roblox a minute ago, but no, i forgot i gave k my password like a year ago, and she hacked into my roblox account, so far she is spent over . k robux out of my k on aesthetic clothes that she knows i hate. so great, a and k both talked s it behind my back and they both teamed together and hacked my acc she friended a is acc on my acc that is how i know so now i lost of my friends of like years	moderate

final thoughts. just wanted to deposit some feelings. i do not know why i am here and i do not know if this wi will make a difference. but i really just needed to deposit some thoughts. i am tired of this life. i have got no real friends and do not really feel connected to anyone. it is always been like this and i have always been the odd one in every social group i have been. i just have not felt sincerely understood for a while and i just can not find happiness in things anymore. i feel like a monster, i am miserable of myself. i do not even know what i am saying anymore at this point. every day is just worse and worse, i just feel so humiliated and embarrassed about myself, i have got nothing and no one. i have always been an outcast, and i feel like i just was not supposed to be and i actually was an accident indeed, i found out recently . this phase of my life has been going on for the past years of my life and i am tired of fighting myself and lying to myself everyday that things wi will get better. i am not stupid, i know that nobody sincerely wants to listen to my struggles, and if anything i can not blame these people, i wouldn t care about myself too if i were them. not even professionals, who get paid daily to help you cope with these kind of things actually care about your well being at the end of the day. nobody cares about me, it is si ample, i have always been that person you go to because you re friends are not around or you do not even have any . and i have always been that person that you d pick the last on the team when you re a captain of a sports game. you wouldn t notice me if were gone, in fact, you wouldn t care or even be happy, some of you have even explicitly told me that you d wish i were gone. i am not good at anything and probably would not ever be, i just do not have anything to be recognized for. i offer nothing as a person and if anything i feel like a deadly weight to the people i care about, everyday. no matter how hard i have tried, i have tried both my hardest and not at all at ti ames. people just do not like me, no matter what i do. i thislike myself too, i am tired of this life, i am just tired of all of this. i am contemplating suicide, but just have not figured out when and where to do it. i know sooner or later i wi will probably go through with it though. this pain is just stronger than any emotion i have felt in my life. yes, i have tried meds... but if anything they made it just harder for me to naturally find joy in things. i see all these talented people commenting on here about how they are feeling the same way as i do, but sincerely they just deserve the world. i am one of the few people and probably the only person who deserves to feel this way, because i am just a miserable person. i just wanted to get my feelings out there and want some of you all to know that you re not alone in this and that i sincerely think you deserve the world! i could not ever wish my pain to anyone. and please, if you read this, treat yourself well. i am sorry. goodbye.	moderate
i do not want sympathy. all i want is to people to listen and tell me what they think of it. even if i am a lost case, i sti will want to do something of my life. i was born with a blood duesorder that may or may not be good or bad. doctors are confusing. i got bit recently by an insect that gave me the lym thisease with my mom. when i talk about my issues, people think that i am negative. i recently entered college and barely made any froends, and those that talk to me do not care about hanging out i used to have friends in high school, i was kinda popular in senior year because popular people adopted me, like we say in high school . nothing better to do, i join the gym in college weirdly, this is the thing that actually brings me join and makes me happy. i read and watch videos about fitness and muscle building. i actually smile when i do so. everyday, i try to change my personality slightly to find one that suits me because i have none. i try and people find me unconsistant because of it. but all i want is to be myself and find people i can call friends who are kinda likr me. but i can not because i dont even know who i am. beleive me i tried. but my issue is that whenever i try something, i slowy become good at it and then love it. i am not pretentious, most of the ti ame i adapt fast at things. i am a blob with no personality. no real friend, obviously no girlfriend, nothing special in my life except the gym. and on top of the cake, i am ugly haha. i trued to grow my hairs, but, they just do not grow. my lips are chapped no matter what i put on it. my face is way more darker than my face, when i do not even go out. my eyebrows are small af. the gym is supposed to help but my diet is not on point because i sti will live with my paremts and thisnmales it really really hard to have a diet on point do not tell me to cook for myslef, i tried and it is i ampossible in this environment . i wished i was different, i wish i could be better. people out there probably have it worse than me ik. and i am not here to get encouraging comments. all i want is advices and people to listen to me. i do bot care what you think of me right now. i wanted to talk and that is what indid. hope someone that reads this manage to pull themselves together before they end up like me. good day to you all.	moderate

everything is my fault. no one tells me otherwise either. anyti ame i have an issue i tell my mom about it and try to get help. naturally she does not just want my therapist to help, she wants to help too. so i try to tell her what is wrong. she is of the ti ame the problem so i tell her she is the problem and then she tells me why she does those things that hurt me all the ti ame. telling me in essence that everything that happens to me is my fault. i am not saying none of it is my fault, but i would appreciate some support, maybe she could change her approach with me, make some attempt to make it better. instead i am just told it is all my fault and why it is. so i blocked my mother on every platform i amaginable just waiting for her to freak the fuck out when i inevitably have to see her. i am starting to believe it all is my fault, i mean shit no one is telling me otherwise. not even my therapist. i do not know how to fix anything either. it is a bunch of feeling like shit all the ti ame. i do not particularly go out of my way to cause my mother to be mad or feel like shit. most of her issues are her untreated issues that she takes out on me.	moderate
my depression never ends vent so basically years ago out of nowhere i stopped enjoying life and having any type of energy or passion. i remember i gradually slipped into this funk and i have not been able to shake it since. three years prior until then, i had situational depression and used to cry a lot but there were sti will good ti ames where i could genuinely enjoy life and smile and feel good on the inside. fast forward years later, and my life has not i amproved but instead is worse. i feel slow, tired, stupid, and just meh all of the ti ame. my head feels like it is stuffed with cotton and everything seems thistant. i long for the days where i could do more than just sit around not being able to bring myself to do anything, where i would sit glued to a project until i finished it. the pure joy and excitement...i do not even remember how it feels. now i save anything i would have loved songs, movies, experiences, etc. for the ti ame if i get better because i wouldn t be able to appreciate it otherwise. i have tried to combat all i feel by eating better and exercising, and it did nothing. for at least months i have been taking bupropion xl ml on top of this, and i do not even feel a smidge better. i work a high stress job, and my sister and her husband whom i live with refuse to sympathize and just assume the worst about me. like i just do not care about anything anyone and i am just selfish etc. etc. like they try to be nice about it but thisapproval is so clearly written on their faces. they want me to grow up and go out and live like my peers...they judge my feelings and actions, they do not understand my struggles at all at all, yet they get upset when i do not open up to them. their expectations increase while i am just trying to keep my head on straight and get a different job move out do whatever enables me to keep living so i do not just lose it and ki will myself. idk yall 	moderate
i know i just posted, but there is a lot going on none of my best friends have ever considered me their best friend. i invite people to things, vacations, going to arcades and things, all types of stuff like that, either just me and a couple friends, or just my family and that friend. no one ever does it back for me. i have never been invited on vacation, i have never had someone decide they specifically want me to go to something with them. i am always the afterthought, or i do not even get asked at all. meanwhile everyone around me is getting invited to things or has things they are going to with their friends. my girlfriend was telling me just si ample things she did or does with her friend in college and i had to leave, go outside and throw up and cry because it hurt so much that i have never experienced something like that. maybe this is not something that i amportant, i just wish someone wanted me specifically around for something. i thought my girlfriend was that way, she asked me to read a book to watch a movie with her, and then she went up to visit the previously mentioned friend in college and watched it with her. after we had a conversation about it beforehand where i asked her not to. then she said oh i forgot i am sorry. i have just been on autopilot for a while . i can understand that, but she did not forget because that night before she left she said oh we ll watch the movie tomorrow morning when i get back . so she did not forget, she just did not care. no one fucking cares. i am no one is first choice and i never have been. it is not going to change either, i am not particularly special for any reason and i am not particularly good at anything. so i guess it makes sense no one specifically wants me around, i do not have any specific qualities.	moderate

my high school friends just let me know they are going on holiday without me this summer. i saw it coming, actually. we have not seen each other much in the past few months and it wouldn t make sense to go me this year. yet reading the text message sti will hurt a lot. it is like a confirmation that we are not really friends anymore and it fuels the insecurities i have about my social ski wills. at least it was nice of them to let me know so i wouldnt have to find out via some instagram post or snapchat. it sucks because i think my depression mostly comes from the fact that i feel really thisconnected from my uni friends even though i am much better friends with them than i have ever been with my high school friends. it is like my brain is sti will stuck in the past and i can not emotionally connect to new people anymore.	moderate

exhausted everything in my life has seemed to just have been completely turned upside down. for the last year i have gone through being seriously sick. i then found out i needed surgery one of my biggest fears . i had to face it our i would continue to be sick constantly, and quite frankly my tonsils could have ended up ki willing me. i was on a shit ton of meds from surgery and to keep the pain down even before surgery. i lost muscle mass, and a lot of weight. i am a figure skater so all this made it hard to come back both physically and socially since i had not been at my rink regularly in months. after that i started taking birth control which completely destroyed everything. i was fighting with everyone. i was constantly nauseous. since i also wouldn t eat i could not gain weight after surgery. it feels like since i got off it my brain chemistry is completely changed sti will. i am very emotionally exhausted and have little motivation for anything in my life. my doggy best friend of most of my life died at the begging of last month. i had to say goodbye twice in one week when i did not want to. my dog and my therapist who left for private practice. now i am having to get used to a new therapist in possibly the toughest ti ame. to top all this off i could not even enjoy my birthday because i got food poisoning which led me to vomiting. which i have a major phobia of. now i am faced with getting my license, a job, earning a ged and transitioning into being an independent functioning adult. i have no clue what to do anymore. everyone is just upset with me because i am an emotional mess and a hassle. i do not want everyone to do everything for me. i just do not really want to be here anymore. i keep thinking i can switch off the pain i am in. i know i can not. i feel completely lost.	moderate

it sucks being the back up friend i have a group of friends i have kept in contact with from high school, and we all just graduated college. fortunately for me, everyone moved to the major city where i attended college and decided to stay. we have mentioned how fortunate and lucky we are that all four of us stayed in touch, actually liked one another in high school, and up to now in the beginning of our young adult lives, but someti ames i feel like the odd man out. like last night, i saw that the three of them went out, and i did not get the invite, which was fine. but then this morning, our group text was used to talk about brunch plans and everyone was chi aming in, which is great. except the last text in the group before that was me trying to make brunch plans and nobody answered, which makes me feel like nobody wants to hang out if i am the one initiating plans. then, they started talking about things that happened last night, and so when i finally just said i am lost, one of them explained the situation to me and said that it was an i ampromptu meetup. i may just be overanalyzing this, but the only ways i see the i ampromptu meetup happening are if they individually texted each other and just did not want to invite me or that there is a separate group text where i am left out. it just really stinks because i genuinely think of these guys as my best friends, and i was so excited to have them here in my city. it is selfish to say, but with this happening, it feels less like my city to me and more like theirs where i am a side character. it feels like i am the back up friend when it is convenient.	moderate
people they are really good at turning your back on you. i have been giving my ti ame, my thiscussions, my laugh and my joy to people that never deserved it. i have waste myself believing that this is what i had to do to make people get to love me and get interested in me. i just ruined my present self and today all the things people can say is that i should be like this... i should be like that. nobody fucking get it. all they are good at is saying the same generic stuff, probably nearly the same as i do now, but at least i am awake about it... you can not get yourself back that easily. i am not able to rebuild myself. oh yes it takes ti ame, oh yes of course... knowing that you have been right all this ti ame having nobody to listen, and later people say the same and everyone claps and wake up... what a fucking pathetic world...	moderate
feeling completely empty amp absent, insignifican not... hurt f usa being treated like i am insignifican not, irrelevant, or not good enough to be cared about just makes me feel more and more empty and then i proceed to look at myself as if i am a vi willain and maybe i should just not care about anyone but myself. but i can not do that, let us be real. it is not my nature. this has happened all my life, but especially right now someone i thought who cared i mean they normally do, they were what made me realize, okay at least they really do care about me they are just treating me like a doormat. a punching bag. they do not care at all what i am doing in my life, how i feel, or the fact that i am completely hurting myself and my life. just when things were getting to be alright and now i feel liek i have been flung into this whole other di amension where i am not i amportant. not even to myself? i am empty. i can not even feel relevant or real. i do not even wann talk about it, i am just here physically but i do not know man. it is not fun.	moderate
one thing each day for the past years i have struggled with depression i have my good and bad days, mainly bad, i have been taking photos to get better at photography i personally think my photos are great although the web does not seem to like them and i take or edit one each day, never to post most of them. me and my friend started a youtube channel a few months ago and it is the same story there, always i amproving but never with appreciation. my point is that years ago i was majorly in debt with a problem surrounded by people who hates me and i was being crushed under, by keeping myself to myself and allowing myself to heal and working on personal goals things havnt changed much, i have i amproved as an artist but that is all, no one is perception of me has changed, and that is what makes me realise that it is my attitude towards life that can hurt, i am alone, i get sad all the ti ame, i sti will feel depressed hugely, but the difference is i now recognise it as an i willness and not self hatred, just a hatred of my perception of the world is perception on me, my point is just grow yourself, take a step everyday towards who you want to be, walk a meter everyday and in less than years you ll have traveled to somewhere to you did not recognise from where you were stood, i expect no upvotes or downvotes and maybe even some hate but i think it is i amportant to realise the difference between what causes depression and what depression causes. thanks for listening	moderate
the dust and the mess of our mornings i think about ki willing myself frequently. but not so much the act of doing it, more so the aftermath. my parents or friends coming into my place after not hearing from me for a few days or weeks, only to find my thistended, bloated corpse and malnourished dog waiting to greet them. i do not get upset when i think of ending it all, i get upset at the idea of the aftermath. my dog, suffering alone until someone arrives. my father coming in to the awful smell, too late to talk me out of it. too late for anything. so, i do not do it. i just languish in this swamp of thoughts and thisdain. i find myself hopping on to social media to find reprieve in depressing self loathing memes. it really is a medicine for the weary soul to know others out there are coping with si amilar thoughts by making funny pictures to share online. i am grateful for that. i find myself sitting alone most days after work. i come home, pet my dog and watch my favorite news and tv shows. i curse at the screen when i see the leaders of the country i live in lie and cheat and steal. i clinched my teeth when i see pictures and videos of happier people doing happier things in a happier life and i resent them. i see a successful person or attractive woman and my heart fi wills with self hatred. some cancerous lesion that flares up whenever i am reminded that i am and sti will have not found purpose to my existence. for some of us, it comes so easily. for others it does not come at all. this self loathing does its best to assign blame to other things and other situations, but in the end it all comes back to me. i have had plenty of opportunity to change, to grow to be. but i could never muster the wi will. even with the things i am passionate about, ive found myself held back by insecurity and anxiety. i am a type diabetic. in i had a heart attack. i have a defibri willator installed below my left collarbone now and have since gained lbs. this all happened because i gave up. i started drinking beers a night after work and chain smoking cigarettes. i would find myself trashed on facebook at am casting insults at whoever read my status updates, lashing out at anyone who even seemed like they lived some decent life. i hate everything, but after my heart attack i felt this awakening. what a relief to survive all that it was. i went through hell recovering from it. i thought that it was something keeping me here because my life was going to finally mean something but it never did. this epiphany of hope became a pi willar of salt and in the present i feel more lost than i did before. i do not drink anymore, nor do i smoke cigarettes. antidepressants ruined my love life and after attempting to change the type i was taking, had a quite terrifying mental episode that i never want to go through again. so, now i am off of them again. trying to digest life in small bites. trying to smile in public places and pretend that my life is full of joy, friends and family. it is taxing to pretend, and its full ti ame. it does not stop when i am alone. i pretend alone, too. i ignore what hurts until i can not any longer. eventually, the people i have loved and lost start seeping back into memory. ancient memories of friends that have died wi will pop in without provocation and play back in my head over and over. i wi will think of the activities in store for my day and realize do not have any. so i wi will sit and be afraid that this is it. the weight of these feelings a constant in a life that has nothing going for it that makes me okay to carry on. i sleep for long periods of ti ame in hopes that i wi will fall into a dream or nightmare. in those places i can sti will see things i miss and people i love. i saw my grandfather last night and though i can not remember hardly anything of the dream now, i remember talking with hi am then. i do not believe there is some omnipotent being looking out for us. i do not believe that my grandfather is presence or anyone i have lost is here to nurture and care for us. i think that death is like birth it is oblivion until you re living it. some endless, dreamless sleep. i am ready to sleep now so long as it does not trap me in some afterlife. i am tired of writing this right now, but i feel like i may add more to it. if anything, i think this has been therapeutic for me. in hindsight, i am angry at myself for writing it. i am angry at myself about everything.	moderate
situational depression? heartbreak a month ago i had my heart ripped out of my chest. the love of my life decided i was not the love of hers. i had to move out of our shared apartment and back in with my parents. the future we d planned together is gone and i have no one except my family. i feel so alone and i do not know what i want anymore or what i am supposed to do with a piece of me gone. i am going through a full blown depression. all i wanted was to be loved. she did not even wait two weeks to start sleeping with others i feel like i am in hell. i have no purpose, no drive, no friends, and no one loves me. i am supposed to start therapy in a week but i do not think i will ever be ok. i am m and she was female. year relationship but we knew eachother since we were .	moderate
depressed and working out i have been suffering off and on way more on lately all my adult life of depression to some degree. i managed to stop hating myself for a few months here and there and the extra confidence only gave me a hope that reality destroyed with its way of never being kind to me. i started working out recently which used to give me those happy feeling from the chem dump in the brain, but for the last week i have only felt worse after working out and hate myself even more for being such a deficient human being. i let myself over eat for years and became a sloppy fat ass and i wi will never be able to lose all the skin even after losing the weight and thoughts of just not being here anymore are the brightest sparks in my brain. every other thought just comes in di amly and brings dread and loathing towards myself and the situations i create.	moderate
i have deep hatred for who i am i am buried by my thoughts. trapped in my own mind and i can not escape. fi willed with sadness, but not depression. feeling like i have no purpose but no reason to die. i do not want to die, i want to live, but for what reason? it seems that everything i attempt to do, i fail. my lack of foresight triggers my anxiety like no other. i am so lost in my life. i feel like there is nothing more for me to do. i have already proved to society that i do not benefit anyone. my presence is unnecessary, life goes on. i search for happiness with no result. no matter how hard i try, i am always thiscouraged and feel like that is nothing i can do to better myself. i am very ugly inside and out. there is nothing good about me. everything i do is for others. i do not care about myself at all. i would rather make someone else happy than make myself happy. i always put others before me and i feel so unappreciated. i am inferior, everyone is better than me. i feel like i have lost contact with my soul. i do not even know who i am anymore. i am completely institutionalized. go to school, come home and do homework and do nothing with myself the rest of the day. rinse and repeat. i am traumatized by my past. i decided in december that i should off myself. i overdosed on aspirin and took pi wills, , mg. it was past the lethal amount. i assumed i wouldn t wake up the next day and that night was the end of me. the ringing in my ears became so loud after i took the pi wills that i could not even think. i thought, this is it. the next morning, i woke up, in incredible pain. i said, maybe tomorrow i would not wake up. so i endured the pain for the rest of the day. woke up again, hoping the next morning i would not wake up. i was wrong, the next morning i woke up in the icu with extensive kidney damage and hearing loss. i thought, i am not destined to die yet. i could not believe what i had done to myself and that i needed to change. current day, i am no longer depressed but i am not happy. i am empty. i do not know what to do with my free ti ame and i can not thispose of my thoughts. i try to escape from my thoughts with drugs and sex but i sti will feel so incomplete. i feel like a chunk of me has been missing since i overdosed. i feel like i do not even have a personality anymore. i am very sensitive and the smallest things can make me cry. i have always been like that, i am vulnerable. i feel like my soul is long gone and i can not retrieve it. i yearn for happiness but i can never find it. i am not enough for anyone and i can not fulfi will others needs. i do not know what to do anymore. i just want to be able to wake up feeling like it is going to be a good day for once.	moderate
what if i am the bad guy? i f have been bullied and belittled. i always tried to comfort myself by thinking that it is ok because i do not deserve this and one day it wi will all be over and i wi will be happy. but what if the reason i am suffering is because i am the bad guy. i always feel useless, like a burden, like i do not deserve to have the things that i do, like i am wasting my life. maybe i feel like this because i am the bad guy. i have always blamed my bullies for making me feel bad about myself but maybe i deserve to feel bad about myself and this is the worlds way of telling me that i am the wrong one and i should not be here.	moderate

fighting i do not know if many of you are aware but the recently crowned boxing heavyweight champion tyson fury struggles with depression. he became champion a few years ago and after that he fell into depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and gained a massive amount of weight. he tells a story of hi am realizing in a sudden moment of what he wanted and where he actually wanted to be.... well fast forward years later and he is once again a heavyweight champion. this story truly inspired me and recently i decided that i was going to make a major change in my life. i was going to start exercising, waking up early, making my bed, eating right and i wi will say it has helped i ammensely. i know depression is something that goes away over night or goes away at all but i think finding things like motivation from others is key. currently i am losing weight and waking up happier than i have been in recents years. from to last month i was absolutely miserable and depressed. not to forget i was being mentally abused and manipulated by my ex. i did not like where i was in life and i am ready for the next chapter... a chapter where i change and grow closer to those who care for me and especially god. i know some may not be religious but here recently i have found that my faith has been growing stronger as well. i wi will start attending church tomorrow morning for the first ti ame in years and i could not be happier about that. my message is to find that inner you that wants to keep fighting! the inner you that wants to keep pushing and i promise that inner you wi will come out guns a blazing! do not give up!!!	moderate

life just fell apart and i need advice to help me grow in the right direction. i have dealt with depression for the past two years and i have been in a toxic on and off relationship friendship with a girl that i have a lot of feelings for. the arguments are someti ames my fault and someti ames her fault but they usually end with her blocking me and me being miserable until she reaches back out to me a day later. my depression has gotten so bad that i just stopped going to my college classes and did nothing but stay in my room. days ago i was on the phone with the girl and we had a huge argument and that argument mixed with my fear of what my parents would say when they found out i was failing school drove me to the point of saying some suicidal stuff. the girl ended up calling the police and then blocking me on everything. i went to a rehab facility for a bit and i am on some new medication. my parents were very loving and welcomed me back at my home i am . i know that i need to cut her out and i mostly have but i am sti will leaving strings attached and she is on my mind all the ti ame. what can i do to cope with the sadness that comes from me and her trying to end what we have for good?	moderate

overworking to fight depression i am a blue collar kid. keeping myself busy keeps me sane. when i feel myself slipping, i throw myself into an overti ame schedule. wake up a am, day job until , personal trainer at or depending on the day, boxing for hours, some contract work on the side if i have booked it. in bes by and do it all over again. go every day of the ti ame. that works well, until it does not. soon the body starts to break down and the emotional dip is compounded by the feeling of overwork. but is not an option and resting is downright blasphemous because then i would dip again. is this what an addiction feels like?	moderate
everyone leaves me in the end gone. everyone is just gone. all the good and bad friends, gone. all the idols that turned out to be the thing i i amagined them protecting me from for years, gone. gone, gone, gone. i ruined a lot of the friendships if you would even call it that. i always put myself below them and that is the only thing that kept them around. i took people is advice and stood up for myself. i said what i thought and how they made me feel and i politely asked them to stop. i told them that i did not want to be hurt anymore. what a mistake. they did not like that. that made them angry and leave. everyone leaves in the end. they blame it on me or say how i am better off with better friends. some would tell me it was just a joke and to toughen up, but what is funny about telling someone they probably wi will commit suicide one day while laughing? maybe it is my fault. most hurt me but i did not mind. it was tedious, name calling and a deadly mixture of words. i did not mind. i did not want to mind. but someti ames i wish some of them wouldn t have hurt me so badly. hit me, tore me to shreds, dragged me by my hair, and become the monster that i feared hid under my bed and behind my bedroom door when i was a kid. i do not even know why i care. everyone leaves in the end so there is no point. it is just a waiting game now. i probably did this to myself, but i wish i knew how i did so i can stop doing it. i just want people to stay	moderate
depression it started a few months ago. i am years old. i was driving home from work feeling perfectly fine and then i felt this weird numb sensation on the left side of my chest. it is been multiple months and it has not gone away. i also feel lightheaded and just bad all the ti ame. this is the worst i have ever felt in my life, and the worst year of my life by far. i am completely sober now also, i used to vape thc oil a lot. i thought it was a lung problem related to vaping this mct oil i used for the first ti ame. but i have been to many doctors and had many tests and they all say they can not find anything wrong with me and they think it is mental. i am considering starting medication even though i am sti will not convinced this is mental. i do not even know what to do anymore. may look for in person support groups. my parents just screamed at me for not going out recently and said i was in solitary confinement every weekend. i wish i could go out like i used to. i never thought anything like this would happen to me. i literally feel like i am living on a different di amension than the last years of my life. but it developed so suddenly, i was perfectly fine one minute, then depressed the next minute for no reason. is that even possible. has anyone experienced anything like this before? can it go away on its own? i feel like the trajectory of my life has been completely altered. i feel like this wi will never go away and am stuck like this for the rest of my life. i do not know what to do, all i know is i am scared, frustrated, sad, and confused every single day at all ti ames. and this strange numb sensation in the left side of my chest just would not go away. i do not know if it ever wi will.	moderate

feel very apathetic and that everything i do is futile hey, so i do not really know where to begin with this but recently i have been feeling like everything is pointless and i have no idea what i am supposed to be doing. i feel like i am living to work and most of the ti ame i am waking up early, working all day, getting home and by the ti ame i have had dinner and done the washing up i am too tired to be bothered to do anything. every ti ame i try to pursue a hobby i quickly lose interest or get bored. i like boxing so someti ames go to an amateur boxing club near me. even though the coaches are nice guys, the quality of training is not great. i know i should not expect too much because it is super cheap like pounds for hour and a half sessions a week but i can not afford much else and do not particularly enjoy it or feel i am making progress. before i moved in with my girlfriend and her family i used to go to another boxing club. i much preferred it there i really liked the coaches, the structure of the sessions and there was a good sense of camaraderie i made a few friends there but it is too far to travel now. besides, my parents did not like me going there because i had a few white collar bouts and admittedly i am not very good at boxing so i won once but got quite badly beaten up twice and ended up needing a brain scan in hospital. it goes back to this feeling of futility because even though i enjoy it what is the point if i am not very good? at one point i was going or ti ames a week and i sti will was not great. i also like music going to gigs and playing guitar , running, weightlifting, football soccer , reading and paying my nintendo switch. but recently none of these have been holding my attention and i have been losing interest really quickly. for example i start learning to play a song on guitar and do not get round to practicing for a few days so forget it and move on to another song. i wi will start trying to run or ti ames a week to i amprove my k ti ame then i wi will be lazy and not bother for weeks. i have been getting better with the weightlifting but si amilarly i wi will miss a few sessions and feel like i am back at square one. with football i am so thisinterested i would not even watch my team play or bother catching the highlights. with reading i would not get past the first few chapters of a book, and even with playing my nintendo switch i wi will start a game and get bored. i feel like any hobby i pick up is pointless and i am never going to get anywhere with it because i started too late i am now . as well, my girlfriend and i are trying to put aside pounds each a month to save for our own house so that makes it hard to afford to be a part of any clubs or do anything outside of work. i have really tried to make an effort to sort myself out by writing lists, setting goals, reminders and etc. but then my whole life feels like a tick box exercise and as soon as i miss a day i feel like i have to start over from the beginning. it is becoming all too easy to take days off, eat junk food, binge social media, youtube and porn. i feel really si willy coming out and saying all of this because i am fit, healthy, i have got a good job, a few good friends, a loving and supportive girlfriend and all of her family are great too but i just can not help feeling that i am going through the motions everyday. i have mentioned the way i have been feeling briefly to my girlfriend and she is tried to help bless her but i do not want to talk about it too much with her or her family because they have got enough on their plates with some of them having depression anxiety already. anyway, thank you to anyone that is read this and i hope someone can help.	moderate
i do not know how to escape my own toxic thoughts hello! i am a year old female currently a sophomore in college. i am a bit nervous to write and post about myself on a social media platform but i just do not know what else i can do. one thing i struggle with is my low self esteem and the fact that i am very very self conscious. i have trouble even walking around because there are so many voices in my head that tell me you probably look so ugly right now , that person is wondering how one can be so ugly and is feeling so bad for you , your face is so gross yikes , go in the bathroom and check your hair right now you look awful i do not like what i see in the mirror. it makes me feel so dumb because no one is actually calling me ugly and putting me down it is just .. my own voices in my head and i can not seem to escape it. another thing is i get so lost in my negative thoughts it feels like i am going down a spiral. i need people around me or else i feel like i am going insane because of myself. as bad as this sounds i hate myself so much and it really affects my well being and my school work. one last thing is in regards to my family. i come from a strict, christian, conservative asian family. we never talk about our feelings and ive never seen my parents cry. my grandpa is really sick and going through chemo right now and my uncle might be going to jail. my parents do not tell me anything about it and instead i hear about what is going on in the family from my sister. i often tend to blame my parents for how i feel and i feel really bad about it because i know they never said anything to hurt me on purpose. or maybe they did i do not know. growing up i got yelled at a lot. i know they just wanted the best for me but getting yelled at for hours straight for instance for losing my belongings made me sad. and the next morning the day would just go on as if nothing happened and i was sti will supposed to be happy and respectful. some things they have said had really hurt me. for example they said they could just see me being miserable in the future. and i do not know ...... i am not really sure who i am living for and what i am doing. freshmen year of highschool my mom read through my journal and found some depressing things and i told her i wanted to ki will myself. the response i got was oh really? and we never talked about it ever again. i tried talking to them about how they made me feel recently but i got yelled at for that too. they said being sad and being stuck in the past is very i ammature of me and i should just move on. but i swear my parents are good people. we moved to the us years ago and we started from the bottom. we had a small room just enough for the four of us to lay down on the floor. my parents did not even have that much room to put their clothes up in hangers. they worked so hard and just wanted the best for my sister and i so i feel really bad that i say bad things about them. that was so much wow sorry. i feel lost and sad have the urges to cut myself a lot. i used to in highschool but i have been trying not to recently. i am having a hard ti ame keeping up with everything in school. i do not know what to do. i tried talking to a therapist at school but she told me to talk to my parents . sorry i had so many things to say but thank you.	moderate
why does everything have to feel so pointless? i can sit here on reddit all damn day and night, and then when i am bored of whatever little content that slithers onto my home page, i just go to look over to my steam games. nothing interests me. nothing. i load up a game and i ammediately turn it off. then i feel the pain in my back and remember, even if i did enjoy these games and this internet bullshit, it is just going to hasten me to my painful death. can not even stop eating because it is one of the few things that gives me any pleasure. i have no desire to do fuck all. i tried gardening, it is just a lot of effort trying to get some green fucking thing to grow. it just fucking sits there, it is pointless. same with my stupid goddamn beta fish, little bastard is not even entertaining. sti will, i do my water changes and shit all correctly. sti will is not enjoyable. i just have no energy to pursue anything. the future feels forfeit, an eternal starless night. i just constnatly feel like i am looking into an empty refrigerator, checkign over and over again to find something. even what little can hold my attention just pisses me off now since the back pain is gnawing at the back of my mind until i am a bitter fuckwad. why does everything feel pointless? nothing i used to enjoy brings me any pain. nothing i could possibly forsee in the future brings me any happiness. i have got nothing. i have genuinely got nothing except my ability to rant in an echo chamber that wi will already verify my miserable emotions. i am hopeless.	moderate
self destruction though i have been questioning myself whether i am just acting that i am depressed or that i actually have something going on, i was wondering if anyone else has been self destructive during his her depressive phase? i deleted hundreds of poems, burnt some of my high school memories and deleted some melodies i did on guitar. i truly hate myself, and i do not want to exist anymore. people thought i was a prodigy at an early age, now i am nothing more than a piece of garbage. does anyone else have that issue?	moderate
i almost told my mother i am not diagnosed with depression. i sti will can not accept that the last years i am not myself and even though everyone is starting to notice now i say to myself that i am just lazy. my mother visited me i study at a uni not far away from home a month ago and i was not worried cause i am always very good at hiding what i feel. but this ti ame was different. she said something i now can not remember. something small but i just broke down. started crying in front of her for the first ti ame and was ready to tell her everything but once more i decided not to. i told her that i liked a girl who did not like me back and i was sad because of that. she believed me and never spoke of it again. i have not told anyone about what i am feeling and every ti ame i am ready to i decide that it is better for everyone not to get involved with me. everyone wi will characterize me as irritating because i always try to pass as a happy and normal teen. my parents think i am doing drugs and say i do not seem normal. i do not know what to do anymore. hiding it consumes most of my energy and i do not think i can keep this going much longer. it is the first ti ame i am writing here and i hope i did not bore you too much.	moderate
i miss this guy, i hate myself i met hi am last summer. he comes here on vacation quite frequently we both have depression, he can not have kids and that is what triggered it. he is in a relationship now, his girl cheated on hi am with a yo man but they are in an open one so he did not care enough to cut her off. i see how miserable he is in his face, he said wants to move out on his own, he lives in a nearby country with mine and people usually i ammigrate in mine from his to work. but he has a super good job that his brother helped hi am get it so i doubt he would come live here. before he found out he can not have kids he had a girl for years and they would have gotten married. he is so cute and great, what a lucky girl she was. i feel depressed again, i am not worth anything, i wish i could see hi am. i wish i would motivate hi am. who cares, i hate myself	moderate
i am not okay i found out through the grapevine that i am the problem they are talking about in the meetings. it is probably true. i just wish they would just bring the issue to me directly. i do not want to suck, it just happens. so i am angry, i think, but i am not sure if it is at then or at me. also, i am fixing my golf swing and i just keep sucking in every direction on that. at least i could work my fucked up swing. so i am frustrated because i can not seem to make my body do what my brain knows it should. le sigh	moderate
today i realised how the downward spiral works so tldr my dad is got cancer, along with internal bleeding and thrombosis. he is a trooper, and curently stable, but the reality is not overly positive. when dwelling on this tonight, with the fiance asleep in bed and just myself and the cats ski amming through the internet, i suddenly began to feel alone, isolated and like there was no way out. this is when i realised we re not meant to be alone in this. we need the support network to stay strong, to keep fighting. so i just wanted to out this out there for anyone who starts feeling the shadows closing in. reach out. ask for help, tell others and ask for someone who wi will listen. you re never truly alone, especially in this day and age. it can often feel like we have nowhere to turn, when in truth we have the entire world at our fingertips, and while that power can someti ames make things worse, its also fi willed with the people from this community who are wi willing to help keep us strong. so as someone who is feeling all the same feelings as you right now, know that there is always somewhere to turn, and someone wi willing to help. we re here for each other. stay strong my friends. we all need saving every now and then.	moderate

sound of silence the wife is out with friends and family today, so i am home with the pup and kitty. doing some thishes because it is easier to fight the intense urge to sit and do nothing, than it is the amount of anxiety i get from the mess. i can not be in silence. so i am listening to is country instead of the usual current day rock. and for about thirty minutes. i was happier than i have been in a year. for thirty glorious, heavenly minutes. i had no anxiety. no depression. no stress. just belted out some country and laughed as my puppers side eyed my singing. true peace. once the thishes were done. the kitchen cleaned up from dinner two nights ago. and the thishwasher running. once i returned to the couch. the happiness left. as always it does. but for those thirty glorious minutes. i was free. webster is dictionary describes silence as the forbearance from speech or noise. the absence of sound. i strongly thisagree. in silence there is so much noise. such a cacophony of noise. you are trash . no one loves you . you are a waste of air . the voices go on. i could write until ti ame ends and darkness descends and never have all written down. and the worst of it all. it is not the voice of any detractor. it the voice of a childhood enemy. not the voice of a best friend long since past. no. it is my own voice i hear. when the music stops. the tv turns off. i only ever hear my voice. my daemons. my silence. my question, dear redditors. what do you hear when all else ceases to make a peep? what makes you listen to fall asleep to a movie every night for years? what is the sound of your silence?	moderate
my so m is depressed hey all. my f ldr fianc m is depressed. it began about half a year ago. it got really bad and about months ago it got better. i thought he was finally okay. but i recently found out it is gotten much worse. he tried meds and therapy once. it did not help. so now that it is back he does not know what to do. i do not know what i can do either. i wish he would give therapy another chance but it did not work last ti ame so why try again? what are some ways i can help hi am feel better? we are long thistance so i can not be with hi am all the ti ame. he sleeps a lot and he feels like a failure and a pos because he just graduated and is having a hard ti ame finding a job and figuring out what he wants to do in life. he feels like everyone reminds hi am how behind he is. this is hard on me. i know he is the one depressed but it is very emotionally hard for me too. any advice for both of us is appreciated.	moderate
nothing the worst thing about depression is that it takes away my ability to have the proper emotional response to certain situations. like right now i know i should feel stressed and anxious about my upcoming exams but i feel nothing. complete emptiness. and that should make make me sad but again i feel nothing. i just brush my shoulders and continue thinking about how fucked i am.	moderate
my life feels ruined i have been depressed about never having friends i can relate to because i end up doing toxic shit with anyone who ever tries to be my friend and basically ive never been able to see that i am to blame in all my struggles and ive ruined my relationship with my father and brother and friends and my self esteem is and has been so low that i almost feel like i can not go on anymore. but at the same ti ame, being aware of how my behavior has affected other people and my own life might help me to rebuild myself but it feels like a gargantuan task that i dont have enough energy to do. like i am somwhere between hope and despair and i dont know	moderate
come on, i dont really know, but i needed to write this down. i need someone, someone to hug me. hold me tight and never let go. i will feel real again, i will exist again. i am barely getting by, and none of my current relationships dont seem to matter much to the other member. i am regularly ignored. turned down whenever i try to spark a conversation, but i can not help but use the dullest openers. i wish i was an interesting individual. thinking about it, i wish i was again, particularly this one walk through a hi willy forest, phone in pocket, listening to come on eileen out loud. it makes me feel free. glad to know i was named after that song, yet i yearn for someone to truly make me feel like eileen .	moderate
maybe a show of hands dead poets i can not live in a world where you exist, i want the pain to go away so maybe i should just slit my wrists ... watch the tub fi will with my dna, realest thing you have ever seen. now i have created a chaos scene. i departed, so no blame on me. this is what it is like when the good guy dies in the movies. bunch of confusing mixed feelings. tears may shed, but it is not because you miss me. it is because you feel sorry for me, i wish i could feel worthy. but maybe i am unholy, makes sense that christians look down upon me. they do not like a dark minded writer, y all can sue me. i am a broken spirit, so do not expect anything uplifting. i am just like the holocaust, fi willed with endless tragedy. it is so unnerving. even my loved ones are turning against me. so what is the point of living? i rather take this glock and blow my brains to smithereens. have my conscience looking like uncooked meat, hence i am raw as can be. unfiltered, so i see no hearts on my screen. makes sense why my vision is blurry, because my future is forever thistorted. never wi will it be in hd.	moderate
hate being away from home so this is something i want to kinda figure out i have been dealing with a lot of stress with a relative who is in the hospital and stuff with work. since she has been gone for two weeks i have had to maintain her ani amals and her thisabled roommate. and its coming to a point while staying at her house. i have been missing home a lot. i go there from ti ame to ti ame to get stuff and everyti ame i am there i feeling like just not leaving. i just want some advice to get though this and be able to feel home sick so much.	moderate
my gf of years broke up with me months ago, and i fell into a hole that i can not get out of. first of all, i am sorry if this is completely chaotic but i am laying in my bed at almost am and i do not know what to do. for the last few months, i have been going through a constant roller coaster ride of emotions. for a few days or someti ames weeks, i feel good, someti ames even euphoric, but after some ti ame i always fall back into that hole. towards the end of the relationship, some cracks started to form, which i failed to notice. she told me that she did not love me anymore, we had a little pause for about a month that kept my hopes up, and after that she put an official end to it. she was dating someone new about a week after that, which was the final nail to my coffin. the state i am in scares me. i knew that it would take a while to get over it, but it feels like it is getting worse. it went from me being sad about the end of the relationship to me feeling bad about myself, loosing my self esteem, and the last gli ampse of hope about my future. i have no idea where my life is headed. i am currently in university about half way to my bachelor is degree, but i do not know what to do when i get it. i have no goals for life, no particular job i have in mind, nothing. i think when i sti will had my girlfriend, i at least knew that i wanted to be with her, and it kind of felt like a plan. now it feels like i have nothing. i just do not know what to do. i am grateful for every single bit of advice. if you have any questions, please ask, i know that this was probably a total mess, but i honestly think that i wi will end up deleting it all if i do not post it now.	moderate
i f ing hate myself so much... i am just so ugly, unattractive, and unski willed. there is absolutely nothing there to be interested in... just a miserable shell of a human being... and the shell is broken, too. i am so ugly... i get now why know girl has said yes. i get now why people do not initiate anything with me. i get now why i do not deserve anything that i have. i am so fat and ugly, and i do not have anything worth loving. nothing to make someone love this empty shell i live in, this cracked, broken, thisgusting shell. i wonder how anyone even bears to look at me, much less have the bravery and courage to send anything more than a middle finger my way. gosh... i hate myself so much.	moderate
i just need to vent since i have no friends anymore i just need to vent with the more i talk about it to other people i am realizing how manipulative and abusive the friend i cut off a couple months ago was. every ti ame i think of her i realize one more thing she did that affected me on a deep level. i only have friends now since i cut her off, they are both at college so i am alone for now. i sti will miss my ex even though it is almost been a year. i sti will love her, i adore her. i can not be happy when she is not here, her shadow clings fo every thing i do. i know i wi will never be happy or in love again. i have chronic fatigue , chronic pain, and a heart condition so every day is a struggle. i spend everyday in pain. i worry about money to pay bi wills every single month, i never feel relaxed. my i ammune system is practically destroyed from eating thisorders. i think about suicide everyday and nothing gets better. i am so off track of my personal goals for life. everyone says i am sti will young and all that shit, but i have spent a decade being miserable who is to say the next decade would not be shit and the one after that and the one after that. if we look at the evidence plain and si ample, life is bound to follow the same pattern of getting worse and worse as it has thus far. i do not know what to do, i am so extraordinarily miserable but also numb at the same ti ame. i do not have hope, and i do not want to continue.	moderate
my sister called me fat my younger sister y o was being really weird, chilthish and self absorbed all day. and i finally gained some motivation to go outside so i wanted to go out on a walk with my family and our dog but they were all being really slow. so i sat on the side of the couch and suddenly my sister said she heard a cracking noise. even though i heard nothing. suddenly she became angry and told me i was sitting on her phone cable so i stood up but there was not anything there. i said something about her acting stupid so she got angry and said the whole couch made that sound because i was really fat. i used to weigh kg. then i lost kg so i weighed kg but recently because of my burn out i rapidly gained kg. i am . cm btw weight is a really sensitive topic for me and she knows it. i went outside and had a mental break down. literally just sat on the ground and cried in my front yard. i am feeling really awful and just when i thought i was finally getting a bit better her words knocked me back to square one. i just finished binge eating and i despise myself for losing control over all this. fuck.	moderate
i feel like life is just a cycle i wake up, rush to my bus after struggling to wake up, then i am tired for the entire day because of my shit sleeping habits. eventually i get excited to get home but once i actually get home, i am happy for about an hour unti will the reality of my shit ass life kicks in, and i do mindless videogames that i barely enjoy anymore or mindlessly scroll through reddit because i have basically no actual hobbies i enjoy anymore. i barely eat dinner, then do my homework at a very late ti ame, then listen to depressing music unti will am. this repeats for another days until i get excited for the weekend, but spend it doing nothing proactive and mindless activities i barely enjoy doing si amply to pass ti ame. i honestly prefer school days over weekends, because for a few hours i forgot that my life is terrible and i am not doing to have any bright future because of my crippling laziness and inability to care enough to fix my terrible life style.	moderate
anxiety and depression have my mind making me feel so isolated from everyone as everything. i am married with a kid. i am a stay at home mother. a lot of my problems are first world and some are just from a shitty childhood and being mistreated, and just a bunch of other factors. i can not talk to my husband because he gets down and stressed about me being depressed. he is very loving and a great man but he holds things heavily, and i do not want hi am to stress. i can not talk to anyone because i feel like i am burdening them with my issues. the last ti ame i opened up i was mocked as i do not see those as real issues, i have been blah blah blah after said friend always affirmed that they were there for me. i feel like i have no one. and i do not even have ti ame to get help. i am trying to channel this into art or something because last ti ame i was hit heavy with depression i was drinking a bottle of wine every night at the bare mini amum. just... feeling isolated. can not talk to anyone. i am not suicidal because i have too many people to look after and i do not want to go out that way. i have been faking being happy and it is getting exhausting, so i am just on autopilot. anyone else relate to feeling isolated on autopilot?	moderate
reality check. for a large portion of us, we wi will struggle with this for the rest of our lives. because no matter how many cocktails they offer, therapists we see, or promises they make, it would not change the fact that we are alone. not by choice but because of the way our world functions. how many ti ames have you heard i need my space. i wore myself out worrying over you. you just do not want to get better. did you forget to take your medication? yet we are told that you have to love yourself. how can you love anyone else if you do not love yourself? it gets better. you just have to believe. you re not the only one suffering, others have it worse. it is comedic at this point. amp nbsp who can blame them really? spending your life with someone who has depression is probably not high up on anyone is list. if you find someone who wi will stay by your side, you have someone most of us wi will never have. someone rarer than gold, an exception, not the rule. cherish them. amp nbsp the truth is most of us are tired and there is no where to go. no one to turn to who would not put you into a cage while asking you to be happy about it. there is nothing for us. some of you wi will find hobbies that keep your mind off of these facets of our shared situations. some find solace in helping others as they are rotting away inside. others just retract into an ever expanding black hole. amp nbsp regardless of our coping mechanisms or the labels they give them, the effects of this thisease remain. it itself remains. it takes you apart piece by piece. it wears down the people around you until they can not take it anymore. it leaves us alone, broken apart, fruitlessly trying to piece some semblance of an existence together. is it any wonder why some people choose to check out? a real conversation needs to be had, because people is attitudes towards this thisease are not changing for the better. the way they treat people with this thisease is not changing for the better. it is all an assembly line to produce something they find palatable. something they do not need to develop any self awareness or perspective for. no one actually cares about the words on this screen, the person behind them, or the tears that fall onto the keyboard as they are typed. this entire website essentially functions as a social pressure relief valve. clearly it is not working if the suicide statistics are any indication. i am tired of pretending all of this is anything but a cruel joke. the reality is what it is and i am done surviving in it.	moderate

i want to go home i have felt homeless for quite a while now. i have a roof over my hear at the moment thank god . but, does anyone else feel like the cruel and judgemental world is not really home? i mean, everyone looks down on me and i have only ever meant well. i have a heart full of compassion and love, but i have never fit in because of it. i have always looked at life differently than most people. i do not care about success or appearing cool. i just wanted to show love to others while here. bu people do not understand me. i have no friends anymore. they have all left. my best friend laughed at me and stabbed me in the back, even though i was always there for them. no one sees me. i feel invisible. i am in the lowest class of losers in this world. i did not make it and i do not care if i ever do. love is all that matters in life. i wanted to have children to love, but i wouldn t want them to grow up in this world as i have known it. i would be afraid i could not protect them from the evil things and people who have hurt me. i am not particularly religious, but i am a christian, and i just want to go home to someplace called heaven where people would not judge me anymore and where i can feel like i am loved and accepted for who i am.	moderate
i am over it to whoever, i might actually just be writing this for myself to get it off my chest. i am done. i have no joy in my life. i sit behind my pc all day, supposed to finish my th and last year of my ani amation study. i am at a massive creative block, probably because i feel so bad all the ti ame. i am very lonely, i stopped talking to my friends because i am really anxious about social things. i let people walk all over me and i am way too nice. everyone is always very negative towards me after a while and try to talk me down. i even realized my longest friendships are very manipulative and abusive. nowadays i dont know if someone is being nice to me or if they are fucking with me. i might be austistic idk. when i hang out with my few friends it feels off, like i am an intruder that noone invited, or has to invite because i am their longest ti ame friend. i feel like an actual alien among people. i just dont have the green skin and big eyes. all my interactions with people are awkward, new people or people i know, family, whatever. i stay up all night because i am afraid of laying in bed with my own thoughts, keeping my brother awake a lot of the ti ame because of keyboard typing and talking etc. this makes all of my family at home very mad and usually they just pull the internet. pretty sure they all think i am very weird. i jerk off way too much, i play video games all day instead of working on my last year of uni. i wish i put more ti ame into playing guitar, and maybe tried singing. but i can not push myself to sing because everyone can hear me and that makes me anxious. i wish i was nicer to my brother. i wish i showed people my emotions. i am thinking about moving to a different country, but i might aswell just end it right here. i can not bare the pain i feel waking up, and the pain i inflict on my brother and parents. but i also dont want to add even more pain of me ki willing myself to my family. so i dont know what to do. i might just make this one selfish decision, itll be better for them in the long run.	moderate
everything feels grey hey all, so i have been dealing with depression for quite some ti ame. i got diagnosed in winter of , went on medication and it worked for a bit. i went off the medication a few months after being diagnosed. i was fine and really had no use for meds. flash forward to january of this year and i came down with a major depressive episode. i consulted my doctor and got back on medication again. i was told to seek out counselling and am sti will seeking options for that. despite suffering with depression i do not really feel depressed. it is not a matter of being down for me. everything just seems to be a shady grey no good nor bad . i have never considered harming myself. i have been in dark mindsets before but it is mostly just been a grey world for me lately. i do not know what i hope to achieve with this post. i just wanted to share my experience with you all.	moderate

wanting to give up, but i also feel like i owe it to myself i am and been depressed for as long as i can remember. through it all, i admit that depression has made sure i do not do anything productive, have alot of negative thoughts that prevent me to do things, and just basically suppress everything about me. from worrying about the wrong things, horrible memory loss etc. i have constant thoughts of, i am definitely going to give up now, i can not do it anymore. but at the same ti ame, i feel like i owe it to myself to try my hardest to be happy and successful before i do because i know i definitely have not and been a weak person my entire life. it just sounds unfair to myself. maybe i wi will really really try with no worry in the world with the mindset, whatever happens, happens. at least i hope i can.	moderate

i thought i was happy for all of a month, turns out i am not. nothing has changed. i just tried to make myself think they were. in fact things are probably worse than before. i am progressively getting lazier. to the point where i can not even clean my room, my car, or care to clean myself on a daily basis. it is the same mundane bullshit. everyday. nothing works or makes it easier. i try to tell someone about it and they end up just putting me on drugs. vyvanse. maybe it wi will help my laziness due to adhd, but it is not going to end up making me happy. in fact i wi will probably just get sadder, because i need to the dependence of a drug to help me. and i wi will end up being dependent on it. yeah it maybe has a better outcome rather if i did not take it but i do not want to be stuck on some medication all my life. i wan t to be who i am now, a creative mind with scattering non stop thoughts. i like it the way it is. it is hectic but in it is own way, beautiful.	moderate

it is been hard i do not quite know exactly what is going on, i never been diagnosed. maybe it is because my mother takes it as a threat when i bring up therapy. probably because she knows she is guilty and does not want to be reminded. eighteen years on this planet, and it feels like nothing has changed. the planet is sti will dying and we are sti will electing republicans. i have no control over what goes on in the world, the only thing i could control is my conscience. yet it seems i ampossible to even do that. one good mental health week and almost instantly hit with the self doubt, insecurities, and the overwhelming idea of being lonely. i do not want to be this way, i want to be better. i am overly self aware of how mental health is, the way i react to things, the way i know what makes me feel bad, and if any of you are taking the ti ame to read this you might be asking the question if you know it is bad, why do you do it? i can not control it. i become aware of the thoughts but it is this evil voice in my head making me believe that i am actually all of the negative things i think. when you constantly put yourself down, surround yourself with negative people, and have a toxic mother, you begin to feed into whatever they are saying. i do not blame my mom, i am slowly forgiving her. i can not stay mad at her forever, she has also dealt with an overbearing emotionally abusive mother. but it is so hard, there is no reciprocation. i am always wrong, she is always right. my feelings should be set aside, while hers are prioritized. this way of thinking has influenced all my past relationships. i attracted people who are hurt and wanted someone to walk all over to feel better. it is tainted the way i view my self worth. instead of understanding that my feelings are valid regardless of what anyone says, i come up with mi willions of reasons why the person making me feel bad is right. i am always the first to apologize even if i was not the one at fault. it is this endless cycle, that i would do anything to stop. and there is way to stop it, through me. but i just do not know where to start.	moderate
being an empath and having depression is torture my therapist told me a few sessions ago that i am uniquely tuned to other people is emotions and inner workings an empath, an overly sensitive person if you wi will and everything clicked. i bought a book and everything it mentioned about how it is like to be an empath described my life. but being an empath and also having depression is like mental torture. when my friends are sad or stressed, i can see it in every little thing they do, and i wi will go out of my way to help running out to grab their favorite snacks, offering to go out and do something they like, ect . i have always been described as a caring and thoughtful and loving friend. i find joy in helping others. yet when i am plummeting into that dark space i end up weeping in bed after hours of being locked away in my room isolating myself and not a soul has checked in on me. i start convincing myself i am this unloved and unwanted thing. why can not they see how much i am hurting? how different i have been acting? why has not anyone check in on me? it is unfair to put those sort of expectations on them, and i know i should communicate better, but some nights i become consumed by these thoughts. that i wi will always be there for someone. but they wi will never be there for me. and i wi will never be truly seen.	moderate
i hate feeling this way no one understands the way i feel. i have no one to talk to about what is building up inside. i have spent all night wondering if anyone would noticed if i was not there and the answer is no. the only thing that is keep me here is my dad and i only see hi am once a year, if it was not for hi am i wouldn t be here right now and i really do not want to be. it is hard to explain why i feel the way i do when on the outside looking in my life is great, but on the inside i have never felt more mentally and physically drained than i do now. i just do not want to live anymore. i am lonely, i am sad and i feel like i have got nothing to live for anymore. i wish someone would understand.	moderate
in a pit i am trying to dig myself out of this hole but i keep making it worse. i recently went on vacation to my favourite place, i was hoping this trip would reset me and make me feel better. it did not. the whole ti ame i was sad, being thistracted. i keep feeling that there is something wrong with me. i mean i was in a beautiful country, surrounded by people who love me. instead i was miserable, dreading it and not feeling one ounce of love. i do not know what to do to get better. it feels like i wi will feel this way forever. i can not stop crying from how miserable i am from how my life is.	moderate
depressed, alone, might be in the dumbest life situation possible and have been having suicidal thoughts for the first ti ame in my life. sorry if post is too long hello, new here. i have tried to keep this as short as i can but it is quite long... i would also normally do a second draft but i do not feel like reading this again so i hope it is ok. there are two major things in my life that lead me here. to start, i was neglected by my parents. they where never mean, they did not let me go hungry, they did not ignore me, in fact i am sti will living with them, they just never pushed me to do anything... ever. when i was they pulled me out of school to move to another state and si amply never put me back in school. my dad tried homeschooling me for a month or two but quickly gave up. because of this i grew up very shy of other people and never had much luck making friends. i spent my teens mostly in my room playing games, watching movies and not much else. i was very isolated. i can not decide how much blame to level against myself for this. how much should a year old be blamed for not enrolling hi amself in high school, especially when it does not seem to matter to anyone around hi am? si amilarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just... never did.i did go to film school which is a whole, long, sad, depressing story in and of it is self but nothing came of it. i also spent a few months looking for work but did not get so much as an email back from anyone. i guess it is not hard to see why when you, an employer, are looking at a year old with no work experience... about the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long ti ame boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing. i met hi am on line when i was and we have been together for about a decade now. long thistance relationships are hard, but it is even harder to sustain one for so long. i love hi am more than anything and love being around hi am. every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest ti ames in my life. that being said there have been some extremely hard ti ames, not the least of which was when he cheated on me. he is always bee very sexual so i suppose i should have known what i was getting myself into. we had a semi open relationship. it was not my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise. blowjobs only. it upset me but seemed almost necessary. we only see each other once a year, we where both young and horny one of us hornier than the other and it seemed like a fair compromise to let hi am explore with other people since he could not do it with me. he started becoming infatuated with one of his friends. he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious. i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me, told me that i was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same. about a year later he cheated on me with hi am multiple ti ames. he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of. what you need to understand is, the last two paragraphs take place over years. when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he is doing with them. it was constant torture and that is before he cheated on me, and he knew that. it did not help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but i was not. i only had hi am. i am and have only ever been with four people including hi am. the other three where out of desperation. a way to back at keep up with hi am and the only way to, at least in some part, blow off some of that frustration and anger. because of that, it was always awkward and i only saw one of them more than once. i really started to grow to hate sex. when he cheated on me it destroyed me. it was the lowest moment in my life. no one to talk to, no real friends, no guidance, nothing. we spent months trying to patch things up. i sti will loved hi am and cared about hi am and did not want to be without hi am so... i decided to open the relationship entirely. my only rule was to use a condom which he had not been . i feel like a door mat... he cheated on me and i rewarded hi am by not only letting hi am keep hanging out with the guy who he says is his best friend but also let hi am keep sleeping with hi am. whenever i was out of contact with hi am because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling. i tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain. i even tried to see a shrink during this ti ame who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, did not seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my bi willing and forgetting to schedule appointments. the ti ame of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to hi am this ti ame. he thought if i met the guy that i wouldn t feel so bad. i spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. his so called best friend was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of hi amself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. after the whole mess my boyfriend said he really does not blame me for hating hi am. despite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent christmas together. i went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy. but now christmas is over and he is gone back home and we re not sure when we ll see each other again. we re trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we re currently at a loss. it is always hard when we separate after months together but this ti ame has been much harder. we do not know when we ll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. i know it is only a matter of ti ame before he starts fooling around again and i know he is already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends. i do not know how to handle this anymore. i am tired of only having myself to talk to. i am tired of feeling walked on. i am tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i do not have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness. i really do love hi am and i know he really loves me. when we re together we re inseparable and do everything together. but when we re apart it is like i become less i amportant to his life... maybe it is just his defense mechanism for dealing with the thistance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to hi am, he seems to pull away and it is a lot of work to keep things together. so, my situation is, i am , living with my parents, never had a job, have no life ski wills and very little social ski wills. i am in a long thistance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who, any one of them could be the next person. i have no friends and my parents who neglected me are really my only family. i am depressed, angry, scared and above all, i can not even motivate myself to do the things i know i need to do. feel completely useless and broken. i was laying in bed last night with all of this running through my head remembering of course that even all this is only a small part of the story. their is definitely more. and the thought just occurred to me, what if i just fucking ki willed myself. . i am not there yet and am trying to fight those thoughts but i feel myself being pulled back down into that pit and i am so scared of winding up there again and what if this ti ame i fall even further? i do not know what to do	moderate
i am so broken why does it have to be this way? nothing saves me. and theres not really anyone that could ever help, dont tell me do therapy i have done it since i was a child, dont tell me meds i have taken so many, they say that depression is an i willusion i can not believe that . no one can help me. my mother didnt even want me, and , i feel like i am supposed to be used. why are they all so much older than me. why do they like my body when i am just a baby. that is all i feel like all i do is cry, everyone knows life is not fair, i can not even stop cutting for more than a week and i let everyone down. that is all i ever do. i can not even make friends without being weird and useless	moderate
it makes me so angry seeing people use their depression to get attention on social media especially being someone who has received absolutely zero support and empathy from the people around me. i do not even want anyone to feel sorry for me i just want people understand i am hurting and i am trying the best i can to get by. instead my family turns around and talks shit about me, and makes me feel worse than i already am. i have been dealing with mental health issues since i was years old, exacerbated by the fact i was abused for much of my childhood. they turned a blind eye to it all.	moderate
i feel like i have ruined the chances with the girl of my dreams before i start, i want to apologize for rambling and possibly repeating si amilar statements, i am so terribly depressed and feel i have lost everything. i, m two weeks ago had matched with a girl f i wi will call madlad. i had given up completely on online dating and was convinced that everyone my age was just looking for a band aid for loneliness and had no chance of finding a loving relationship. she was like no other. even though i had low energy with replies she showed so much interest and we really hit it off. she ended up asking if i wanted to faceti ame in which i agreed. we started faceti aming and it was not awkward at all, we both felt an emotional connection to eachother and proceeded for the next three days to faceti ame for hours on end while we did homework or were just hanging out in our rooms. i live in minneapolis while she goes to school in wisconsin roughly an hour and a half away. i drove out last friday and she joked saying this was crazy in a joking way, we finally met and she came in for a hug instantly, we helped he friends move dorms which i met everyone before we went up to her dorm and i sat around doing homework with her before the tension became to strong and i asked if she wanted to watch something after we got food. we ended up cuddling together and just enjoying each others presence, we had deep conversations until she said that she has major trust issues, and although we just met, she feels super connected to me. i reciprocate the same feelings and do not quite understand what she means by trust issues. she ends up talking really personally about her high school boyfriends and although i know exactly what i would want to say, i can not and just proceed to listen and comfort her. i laugh it off and say i accept the challenge! that the trust issues latched onto her defend. i end up leaving the night and i feel like it went really well until i wake up the next morning... i tend to be quite overbearing and i am in no means good in texting but a master at connecting with people in person, she responds to my good morning text and how i feel super great about her and that i see something with her. she responds hesitantly saying she was so scared when she woke up and feels that she just let me in and was regretting it, she says even though it feels so right and that i am such a nice guy that she just needed ti ame to process. my responses were minuscule at best, i was no help and just tried to relate and talk about my past with people in an effort to understand what she has been going through. i was at work while this was going on and i was extremely stressed out. the whole ti ame through our texts just felt like she was pushing me away so i decided f this, i can not deal with this right now. i end up leaving work early and drive the hour and a half around pm last saturday. i call her pulled into the college dorm parking lot saying i am sorry, i didnt want to faceti ame or text about all of this and i know we said we would after work but long story short i drove out and i am in the parking lot. she reads my text and calls me minutes later, the suspense feels like i just ruined everything... she calls and says shes not there, that she is out at dinner with friends and doesnt know when she wi will get back. i told her i am sorry and that i can leave, she says its up to me when i without hesitation say i want to talk to you... i want to see you... she pauses and says okay, she texts saying shes sorry and that shes just in shock but is excited to see me. minutes pass and she pulls in and walks to my car since she randomly pulls next to me. we just kind of laugh before i hug her and we quietly walk up to her dorm where we begin talking about everything. she tells me while trying not to cry that she doesnt want me to deal with her and that she really likes me and feels like she wi will hurt me. in summary, we let some of our emotions out and end up cuddling again before we see her friends for a bit, she feels closer to me and more open now, i end up leaving and tell her thank you for not flat our rejecting me. i knew it was but if what i felt like i knew about her was true, i knew she wouldn t reject seeing and talking to me in person. as i drove home that night, i get pulled over for going in a by an officer and am hit with a dollars ticket. i get home around am and tell her i miss her and begin to be super overbearing again. i tell her i got a ticket and i am sorry if i am waking her up and that if i ruined her i amage of me by getting a ticket since this was my first ever run in with the police and i didnt know what to do or say, all i could think about was how she would see me. she waited up the hours at night for me to get home safe and says i didnt ruin anything and that she really liked seeing me and to have a good sleep. i woke up and proceeded to text her goodmorning and thank you for not pushing me away and kept telling her how she makes me feel. i am a triple scorpio if anyone believes in or knows what that is and i am extremely ambitious and passionate but with that comes i ampatience and a great need for thiscipline while she is a virgo. she relapses back to the hesitation and we text very lightly, just seems like we were friends and that she felt afraid that she was opening up to me and letting me in her life. the week goes by and she tells me shes sorry i have to deal with her, that she really likes me and sees something with me and is afraid since shes never been treated nice in the past before. i try to hold myself back and just say its okay and that i care about her, we keep telling eachother through the week how much we mean to one another and how crazy it is that we just met. we faceti ame on tuesday and she says she just wanted to talk about her feelings and we get really deep into our lives, where we want to be, how we feel about eachother, the whole shabang. we end the call and she tells me that talking to me made her feel a lot better about everything and that she wanted me to come over tomorrow aka wednesday, few days ago everything is feeling better and i drive out after my classes to be with her, we just cuddle for a few hours and talk more about what we want and how we see eachother where she asks me if i can be hers, and that if we are officially dating she wi will feel way better about everything. i just smile and say ofcourse before kissing her and we begin to makeout before we go bowling with her friend group. all of her friends really like me and we click super well, i feel integrated except with one girl who is overly dramatic with everyone. i leave and tell her thanks for the great night and that i will text her when i get home. luckily no ticket this ti ame and we say goodnight as she sti will waits up for me when she didnt need to. was a school night for her we plan to hangout on the weekend which is where we are now. i drove over yesterday after work friday and we spend the day with eachother. we cuddle and go on a triple date with her friends and their gf bf s, we laugh how cringey it is but we are so happy together, nothing seems weird and we go back to her dorm that night after hanging out with everybody and i asked if its sti will okay if i sleep over, she says ofcourse and we get comfy and get to bed. i begin talking to her and asking her how she sti wills feels etc. and she talks about how she feels safe and happy with me and that she needs ti ame. we makeout and i go a lot farther than we both thought i would inti amately, no sex which is fine since if we ever do make love i never want her to feel like its something to regret. this is where i make the mistake that i need advice with... early in the night she talks about love and how she views it. she is very practical and says there is no love at first sight, that she was in love once but from being completely rejected had completely damaged her. that there is only infatuation and love is a two way thing. i tell her around am yesterday or today however you view it that i dont just feel infatuated, i didnt say it but she knew, she i ammediately stopped me and said, no, dont say that... i get stressed out and she says i didnt ruin anything but she doesnt feel the same way, that i barely know her and that she wants to take it slow. we makeout again etc and fondle eachother blah blah. i ask her every question i have had building up and let myself go, i give up and feel completely destroyed as how attached i have grown to her. i recognize i fall hard and she knows that and tells me that. she says she sees something long term with me and how she knows her family would love me and wouldnt be trying to make us work if she didnt see a future with me, that she really cares about me but doesnt want to feel any regret and make any mistakes. we go to bed and she wakes me up about an hour later just kissing me and moving my hand under her shirt etc until i become fully awake and try to go for it, i move my fingers down below where she stops me and says, fuck you in her beautiful and snarky voice, that she hates me jokingly i say why? and she says because i know what i am doing, and that i am making it very difficult to hold back and she needs my help. i stop and we go back to bed for real this ti ame after i say sorry for saying the thing she says its okay and that it didnt happen. she wakes up before me and starts kissing me again while i am asleep and does the same thing where we are just enjoying eacothers touch feel that sense of physicality and love. i subconsciously say i love you which freaks her out. keep in mind i do remember saying this but i was half awake and fell asleep almost instantly after saying it, i didnt really know if she heard me or not, it just came out, it is how i feeland have been feeling and been trying so hard not to say. she goes blank faced for the next hour until i wake up and see her so thistraught, i ask whats wrong, this is this morning by the way until she says i am stupid, i didnt mean it, i dont know her and i dont know what love is. i just sit there with my heart aching. i say i was asleep and didnt mean it and that i am sorry. she says its okay and we proceed to cuddle in until am on and off making out and teasing eachother knowing we can not do anything because it was too soon. i say i am sorry for ruining any other chance of coming over and she says its okay, and you didnt say anything, were okay. we go out to lunch with her friends and everything feels find, she doesnt feel like shes rejecting me or weird in any ways, just her normal smiley happy self. we get back and we cuddle again before we both fall asleep for hours, i dreamt about her and was sti will so destroyed and didnt know how to feel. for the longest ti ame even though i am not religious i had felt that i am just some npc being controlled by god and the devil letting fate control my journey until i met this girl and chose to make my own decisions, that i can not wait around for anything and that this girl is someone i can see myself being with for the rest of my life no matter how early it may be. we wake up and i get ready to leave since she wants to hang out with her friends alone later since the one over dramatic friend earlier is jealous that she found someone and that everyone but her is dating somebody. i say sorry one more ti ame and i can tell she is hiding how she is feeling, that she wi will end up rejecting the feelings again no matter how real they may seem to me. we say bye and she says text me when i get home now we are here. pm saturday ... this is how the convo goes and keep in mind i can tell she is ignoring how she feels and doesnt want to think about anything i tried to tell her me made it home madlad okay good me hope things are good with your friends madlad not really but hope she wi will be me yeah... thanks for the fun weekend madlad, i know i made it go downhi will but that is the lowest it could go, everything going forward wi will be better i promise. you have really been trusting of me, i know you are going really fast which is why its my turn to slow down so its not you doing all of the work, everythings alreadu out and said so the last thing is just ti ame. have a goodnight madlad, i will stop spamming you and stuff, you really mean a lot to me. madlad thank you knarsan. i had a fun weekend to heart face emoji minutes later madlad my friend ditched on us. me i am sorry, what are you up to the rest of the night madlad its whatever lol, we are doing shots and watching movies lol me cool i dont drink by the way, not trying to be judgemental, i just dont really participate in the subculture and can come off as a dick a lot of the ti ame reddit madlad whats wrong me nothings wrong haha be safe! i am saying this while typing this thing out and slowly dying inside, i am currently listening to biggie smalls ready to die album and electric light orchestras out of the blue album while crying. madlad i will be safe heart emoji me the stupid little excited smile emoji madlad i am going to get shitfaced i think i read this but dont really know what to respond so dont min later madlad i am sorry i drink lol me you dont have any reason to be sorry, i am sorry i make you feel like i am judging you on that. madlad you dont i just dont want you to think less of me me i dont sti will dying inside me i just care about you, if i judged you on every little thing i dont think you would want to be with me madlad i care about you too, i will be safe i didnt respond to this and that is the end of the story, its now pm and i am completely lost and dont know how to feel, what to do, how to react, how i should feel, how she wants me to feel etc. i overthink and i am a love addict by nature, i am not ashamed of it but i am starting to be, i am learning and experiencing something new and really want this all to work but i dont know what to do... i could really use some sort of guide or just something i do love her, that is why i am so hurt, i dont want to push her away but this constant self torment destroys me and makes me want to look over the gorge is of vermont and contemplate whether i am worth it for anyone, if i wi will ever feel the loving embrace of someone. i know i am probably over reacting but i am struggling to battle with myself and dont know who to tell since i in reality have no friends i would trust. she has trust issues and i never wanted to tell her i did to since that would push her away, i am compeltely open to sharing myself with her which is why i dont have the same problems as her and i am definitely going through

what are the things depression has not stolen from you yet? i want to die and i am wi willing to give up everything. i can count on one hand the things that sti will give me positive emotions. i love the mountains hiking in them and especially driving on the fast highways through them with all the steep grades. it is beautiful and takes focus to put the least amount of stress on the engine and breaks. it gets me outside of myself, which is practically i ampossible otherwise. unfortunately i do not live near the mountains and am lucky if i get a chance to go. 	moderate
anybody ever make realizations about yourself, then hate yourself for how you act for example i constantly fear missing out over stuff my friends are doing and then feeling abandoned and nobody likes me, etc, then acting mean to them passive aggressively or something. then i spot that i am being selfish and it isnt their fault at all even though it feels like the end of the world for me and all i am doing is just hurting other people and making other people not like me. and that just makes me hate myself even more for how selfish and self centered i am. i feel like my heads splitting apart cause whatever i do or think about it leads to me hating myself even more and feeling like a piece of shit person.	moderate

i feel like my life is going down the shitter. i am losing my mind. i do not know where else to go for help, but i know you guys are really supportive so i decided to come here. every day i suffer from terrible anxiety and depression. i feel like i am hopeless and all these mixed feelings just turn into bitterness and anger. i am having anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns more and more often and i do not know how to stop. i am failing in school and am failing my girlfriend. even though i try so hard to make her happy, she always ends up sad because i can not be positive around her. i feel like i am spiraling out of control and that my life is no longer in my hands. i feel as if i am an ambient noise, no life, and no purpose. hell, i barely even exist at this point. i can not even fake being happy anymore because i am just so miserable. i know this sounds like some woe is me type shit but this is pretty much me. a pointless blob of flesh. i can not achieve anything worthwhile and i constantly thisappoint everyone. i just had a mental breakdown today and i was screaming at my parents and ripping out my hair. i popped blood capi willaries in my face and bruised myself. i do not want to ever be that angry but i can not fucking control myself. i just want to be unconscious.	moderate

does anyone else feel addicted to online games because it makes you feel less alone? when i was younger i used to hate online games and only liked single player games like zelda and mario and sonic. now as an adult i can not bring myself to play a single player game for more than like an hour before i get sick of it, only exception is when i watch my son or boyfriend play or vice versa. i do not even really like the online games i play a lot cod, lol, overwatch . i mean they are ok but not so good where they are the only games i would want to play. i feel like i only play them so often because it makes me feel less alone since you re playing with and talking to real people. i do not even have fun if no one is talking in game.	moderate
avoiding the topic with friends i have been pretty open about my depression and anxiety with friends but lately i have felt guilty or embarrassed talking about it again. i actually met a friend for coffee, which was a big deal to me. i spend most of my ti ame alone or with my kids. she had a lot going on with work and some physical i willnesses. when she asked what my plans were i was vague about having to do housework and some daily exercise i am trying to do. i feel i can not really say i am sti will dealing with my depression and anxiety, and if i do my friend wi will think i am not doing enough to treat it. or that i am not doing enough with my life. when you re living with depression how do you much do you talk about it with friends and family? do you feel they get tired of it?	moderate

finally ready to admit i need help i woke up this morning and looked around at the empty food containers all over the house, dirty clothes that have been on the bathroom floor for weeks, sink full of dirty thishes and realised i can not go on living my life this way. my girlfriend and i live together, she would tell me i should see someone but i always insisted i was fine. i finally realised that we both need help. our lives are a mess, how can we go on living like this?. everything is a struggle, there is no joy in life anymore. i think it is ti ame for a change and to get some help.	moderate
i have never wanted to ki will myself more than i have tonight i just do not know if i can not do it anymore. i have been crying for three hours straight, torn up almost everything in my room, crying for help. but nobody ever comes, no one ever hears me. i have cried all my tears now i just feel empty. nobody would miss me or even notice my absence. i am such a burden on everyone i wish i was never born. earlier i wished my car would crash and i would just die then and there. but it would be so selfish of me if i died today. my little brothers birthday is tomorrow, and my big brothers is two days away. i can not, not this week, i it would be so selfish. i wi will be sos selfish.	moderate
just need to post so i do not feel so alone.. i am going to try and make this as si amplified as possible because i have a tendency to ramble. basically my life is shit right now. i have a job that most people i know would be excited to have. i make more money than i should for a job that i did not have to even go to school for, but i feel like i am stuck. there is no growth or anything to work towards. i feel stuck in most aspects of my life. my boyfriend lives with me and does not work currently because he is in school full ti ame. we have been together almost years and lately we fight constantly. i am so tired of the fighting and the negative vibe around me all the ti ame. work takes most of my ti ame and any free ti ame i have i just want to sleep or play games or do something that completely numbs my mind so i stop thinking about how easy it would be to just ki will myself. i do not have any hobbies outside work anymore because i am too depressed to do them. everything i do i feel like i am failing and i have constant anxiety about being an inconvenience to everyone around me. i just do not know what to do or where to go for help. i should be seeing a new therapist soon but i have done this so many ti ames and nothing they say or do ever helps so i am expecting a nothing thisappointing experience. i do not even know what i am looking for from posting this, i guess just sharing my misery with others. anyway i hope everyone has a better day than me and remember to set your clocks forward tomorrow!	moderate

i just do not know what to do anymore. does counseling actually help? i am so tired of everything, despite never doing anything. i have absolutely no motivation to do anything and the rare ti ames i stumble upon a fraction of some motivation, i am too scared to try anything. i have a loving family and my couple of best friends are online so i do not really hang out with anyone irl but i sti will feel incredibly alone. i feel so damn pathetic and i am a loser that is not going to go anywhere in life. i am fucking ugly and would not ever have a gf lol. the only things that someti ames cheer me up is video games and certain movies like superhero shit. i like driving and i would love to have a nice car one day but i know that is never going to happen because i am stupid as fuck and i can not learn anything and i do not like anything enough to try and learn it as a career or something. i just love the feeling of moving and controlling where i want to go. i have always been into cars but i do not know much about the technical shit, because again, i am too stupid. i just sit here all day while being told to go do something or go to school but as you all know it is not that easy. i can not trust myself to do anything right. there is so much on my mind i can not even put it into words and i wi will probably end up thinking of more later cause that is all i do, think about how much of a failure i am and wi will be forever. i am not suicidal but i have always thought about how my friends and family would react if they found out i was dead. gives me chi wills just typing that.	moderate

depression dependency? recently i have felt like i am not myself if i am not sad, because if i do not feel sad i do not feel much at all. it feels like everyone else likes me more when i am down too just because i am actually feeling something and act more alive. i have learned how to act normal living with depression and when i start to do better i like who i am even less. just makes itself into a shitty cycle and i am thinking trying to get on medication might be a route i am finally ready to take. does anyone have advice on if i should? or things i should try before doing it?	moderate

lost in life i do not know if i am posting in the correct subreddit for this but i wanted to get it out somewhere. about two years ago i was diagnosed with narcolepsy. this diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. at the ti ame i was ok with it. i felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. from there i decided to go back to school. i wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. this would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. the school is not offering the classes that i need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. with school being payed by the va and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but i can not get that in on if i am not going to school. i was fully prepared to cut down on spending while i waited to find a job to tide me over. i am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but i have been the only one to cut down on the spending. while trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. initially i was very happy with that. the thing is she has been always working and i am struggling to get a job. the bi wills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. my wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bi wills but to sequester away to use as fun money. again no issue initially. over ti ame it was notice that more an more ti ame and money was spent towards ti ame with her friends while i ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. i have asked to be included, but she tells me she does not want my negativity around her friends. this hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. the past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. this was ok when i was in the military because i spent a large portion of my ti ame at work. i really wanted to push towards better communication and ti ame together when we could get it without cutting out her friends. i began working my communication while i was busy with school. i made sure to tell her when i had free ti ame so that we could spend ti ame together. multiple ti ames that i let her know that i was going to be free on a specific day or that i would make ti ame to spend with her when i knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. ti ame after ti ame of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. it is even more noticeable now that i am home all the ti ame job hunting and i sti will get to see my wife less then her friends see her. the combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she does not want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. i have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how i feel and me to see how she feels about everything. the thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. this again bashed my self worth. the counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. the medication helps for the most part, but i keep getting lack of value i ampressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. over the past few months i have thought about suicide many many ti ames. i have never thought about doing it, just about how i could do it. this scares the crap out of me. it takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. i am at a loss though i love my wife so much, and i think my wife loves me in her own way. the thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. i know it is not all my fault and that it is not all hers, it is a combination of everything. i feel like i have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. i do not feel that i am getting the effort back from my wife. i am at a loss of what to do. i can not seem to dig myself out of this hole and i can not seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how. my wife not knowing how to help seems to have turned into not wanting to deal with it. my life is not where i want it to be right now, and i feel like i am lacking the support to get there by the one i love most.	moderate

i have no chance. no hope. i hate this shit so much since i broke up with my first and only girlfriend about a year ago i have had literally no human interaction where dating was even a thistant possibility. meaning, i have not spoken to anybody who i had any chance of dating, that i wanted to date. i am going fucking insane. i met a girl in the elevator of my apartment building today. she said she liked my shirt and that she studies screen printing at a nearby art school. i was attracted to her, and i wanted a reason to keep talking, so i just asked if i could commission something and gave her my number. a few minutes later i got a text with her name. i replied and asked to see her work when she had a chance. after that, nothing. we met in the morning. it is been all day. i am trying to go to sleep but i am checking my phone every minutes to see if there is a text. i do not even fucking know this person. i do not have any reason to believe i wi will like her other than the fact that she is pretty. i hate that i am such a fucking moron that i am acting like this. more so, i hate that i am such a terrible combination of ugly and socially inept that this is such a problem for me. i just want a girlfriend i like. i do not give a shit about anything else. i turn in days and i feel like my life might as well be fucking over. i went a year without even the slightest hint of a shot at meeting a girl. at this rate i am going to die alone	moderate
wondering if anyone else has felt like this. so ive never believed myself to be depressed but ive always known myself to be very apathetic about things that are at least somewhat i amportant to others. i often find that when i am in a relationship i upset the other person by not taking their feelings seriously because i dont feel as strongly about them, if at all. i ended my last relationship because i couldnt feel as strongly about her as i wanted. looking back she was awesome in so many ways, and i realize how dumb i was. i look for sti amulation in as many things as i can, i am glued to my phone, i love video games, and it drove a wedge between us because i need something to sti amulate me or i feel so bored... i feel like i am not usually sad but just apathetic. lately ive been in a much more hopeless depression because of the fact that i know i have no control over how much things mean to me and it makes me spiral downward because i want to care about things like others do. i am not great at explaining it, and ive considered suicide because of how hopeless i am. i know that i wi will not do it but it is tempting because of how little everything seems to matter. has anyone else ever dealt with this??	moderate

i am scared that the military was a mistake and i am terrified of what happens if i leave i am , i spent most of my adult life jumping from job to job trying to find somthing that i find fulfi willing. i joined the navy mid last year and i can not help but feel like a fraud. i dont feel like a military person, i dont believe in the politics of it and my politics dont align with most of my coworkers. i am struggling with learning my trade, which isnt an issue in itself, but i dont fit in with all of my coworkers. i come from a military family, part of the reason why i joined was because i knew that it would make my parents, especially my mum, happy and proud. ive always struggled with earning respect and validation from my parents and this was an easy way to achieve that, but it hasnt given me any sort of fulfi willment. i know that staying out my year contract is a good financial decision, id be able to set myself and my partner up fairly well in the sort of life we both want. but i hate the fact that every weekend ends with anxiety and despair as i drive back to base to start my work week. i can not decide if i am struggling with doing the hard thing of staying in a job that i hate si amply for the financial benefits, or if i am taking the easy way out by pretending to be someone i am not to i ampress my family. my partner spends most of her ti ame either working or travelling, and i hate that i can not go with her or be a part of that life.	moderate

i am falling apart right now not in the way of crying uncontrollably and having a mental breakdown but in the way i am slowly crumbling under the weight of my familys and schools expectations to be the perfect little soldier that i need to be to survive because right now in the grand scheme i wi will not matter my dad mom sister and grandparents along with most of the cousins hate me think i am weird and have outright said it to my face the only ones that dont hate me havent heard of me i am living for the hell of it i decided that one more day just to see if anything turns out better i am currently writing this trying to cry because even in some of my other posts that is an ability i semi lost a while ago because i was told men dont cry and yelled at if i did the only thing keeping me going is the little door of hope that things wi will get better. and that door seems to be closing i wonder where when and how i will die and i come back to the same conclusion in my childhood room with a rope gun and stool my plan is to jump off the stool gun in hand and shoot myself while hanging if it isnt instant because i dont like pain i just want the pain to end and that seems to be the quickest way i daydream in classes about it and even though i am sti will ok grades wise i am not ok mentally my mind the very fabric of it is crumbling and about to break like i am going insane someti ames i think and feel that ive already become a physcopath and am just waiting for deaths cold but comforting door i choose to believe that theres no afterlife because i dont want to exist i hope. i dont sound like an r i am andthisisdeep type person but i dont care anymore	moderate
tired of being lied to you know what is worse than living with depression and ocd, plus anxiety thisorder for years and not getting treated. going through it in college. on top of that a college states away. i have spent months and have not built any meaningful relationships with anyone. my roomate is always at home cause he lives minutes away and never talks to me. my suite mates are better in the regard that they are at least nice to me and understanding yet i wouldn t call them friends. they have a whole lot of other people they would rather talk to or turn to if they need anything. it is like a list and i am at the bottom. they would only do shit with me when they can not do it with anyone else. everyone else i met turned out to be a liar and snake and there is really one other person that i know here that is around the same level as my roommates, but again, he really wouldn t give me the ti ame of day unless everyone else he knows can not. i tried to make relationships but i have failed. i was rejected from a fraternity by one vote. yes one fucking vote. i could not get a manager job on the football team because in their words they were full, but i know well enough that it is not the case and that they just did not pick me cause i did not have connections. i tried out for the lacrosse club and got cut so there is that. any girl i try to do stuff with ends up ghosting me after a week. yes i am nearly years old and have never went on a date or even had a meaningful relationship with a woman. the only thing going for me is that my grades are good but that does not make me happy as it is what is expected of me. i am supposed to do good in college. all this has lead to the constant brain fog panic attacks and horrible depression. my weekdays consist of going to class, studying, sleeping, and going to the gym three ti ames a week. my weekends involve heavy drinking and drug use. i have developed a percocet and xanax addiction and am well on my way to becoming a coke addict too but it is the only thing that provides me relief in this cruel world.	moderate
struggling so years ago i reached out and spoke how i felt and sent to a so called treatment place insane asylum . basically a place where they just ask you everyday if you want to ki will yourself and stuff. it did not help at all. i just lied to get myself out of there. took an entire weeks. but i sti will feel the exact same. my wife is worried because i can not hide it as much as i use to. any thoughts or help to suppress the feelings. i can not bring myself to actually do it because of her. she would be absolutely devastated if i followed through with anything extreme	moderate
i have been okay for so long i was so depressed last year. i tried everything i could think of to help i tried to go see a counselor, i ran every other day, i drank so much caffeine.. i do not know what happened, but somewhere in december i stopped being depressed. it is been some ti ame now, and i am so scared i wi will be depressed again soon. i can feel the mental suggestions to take things too seriously i did not get everything i wanted done today because it was hard to motivate myself. i have not been working out. i have been drinking more because i have been going out more. it is almost midnight, and i just want to sleep. i want to sleep, wake up, and be okay. i wish i knew what to do.	moderate
need advice f. i do not know if what i am feeling is normal, or if i really should be looking for help. for the past or so years i believe i have been struggling with depression. this past summer was probably the worst it has ever been, but i am currently doing okay. i do not know if i am depressed because i can work hang out with friends and i do enjoy some parts of life. i have a part ti ame job that i do that pays well enough to cover rent expenses. i do not love it there, and that is another side issue but i have not been low enough that i can not get up and go to work when i need to. however i know that there are ti ames when i just can not cope with the struggles of life. i have self harmed on and off for the past five years, not enough to leave permanent or noticeable damage but it is something i am so ashamed of that i have never told a soul, and i do not think anyone notices. more recently i go through periods of starving myself, or eating a lot less than i should be. i am a normal weight and do not believe its an ed, but it is something that i wi will do on purpose when i am depressed feeling low. over the summer i lived alone and there was a ti ame where i attempted to od..i do not know what i was really thinking i just knew i wouldn t have been mad if i did not wake up in the morning. there are some issues with my family that causes a lot of stress, although this is more recent aka past two years . i do not really know what i am asking, maybe just for some advice. i get really socially anxious and the idea of asking for help is the last thing i want to do, but i can not live my life like this. i tried betterhelp a while back but i did not feel as though it help, but i may have gave up too quick. i live in ontario which means eventually i wi will have access to free therapy, but i do not know if i can hold out until then.	moderate
this had just started i have met this one friend of my he would not see this so i will call hi am by his real name christian, back in november of . we have been good friends, until he starts talking about this one girl he has been talking to she would not see this so i will call her by her real name sage and i think of the name and it seem familiar but i do not really think about that much and i have seen her before bet he tell me so much about hi am and her like how they have madeout and how have they had the threesome with a mutual friend named gabe. then i went over to his house early in the morning note they weren t dating, but sage and christian both call sage his main hoe and she also comes over but he did not tell me she was coming over. i then realized i have known her since third grade she just had blond hair and a gap in her teeth with at the ti ame i thought was cute and she sti will has her speech i ampedi ament which i think is cute also. she then remembers me, and i asked christian if they we re dating and he said no, i then asked if he cared if i flirted with her, he said no again. i start to flirt and she flirted back. after some talking we started to talk and he watched us make out which was really weird. christian, sage,christian is sister karli, and i went to the local park and just messed around because no one was there me and sage were talking and hanging around and i guess christian got mad so he wanted to talk to karli, so karli told sage and me to go to the baseball dugout and when we did we looked around and played tic tac toe on the wall and then i picked her up mind you i am and she is around ish and have her put her legs around my waist and i pinned her against a wall and we made out for a while. then karli called us over right before i was going to ask sage out then christian pulled sage aside and asked her out before i could. she said yes too. after walking around some more i went home and cut my self on my right wrist. it felt heart breaking anyti ame i saw them together but i knew who she was, she did not care if she was in a relationship or not if you do not give her dick she wi will find someone to give her dick... christian had to go home early and sage had to get something from dollar general so i went with her. i went home with her and another friend and we went through her camera roll and watched pet cemetery but when the friend left her cat got on my legs when they were crossed and let us say she missed petting the cat on purpose and i pet her pussy on purpose too. a week or two later she calls hi am later and he breaks up with hi am and i am not at all the extrovert type so it took a week to even ask her out but she changed the subject by saying i am going to a fuck buddy is house later. so i felt great after that and we really never talked since and now we re here and i sti will have suicidal thoughts and want to cut myself daily but i am trying not too but i know one day i wi will not be able to stop it. tl dr my friend tells me about this girl. i hit it off with her her starts to date her she cheats on hi am with me she calls hi am a cheater they break up i ask her out she changes the subject and she stops talking to me.	moderate
indecision... i want to be gone. i admit that i am a lurker. now is not the ti ame to explore that. i am sitting at my dining room table. it is in the morning. i want to go get in my car and leave. maybe forever maybe not. it is irrelevant. i want to run. i want to run away from my year relationship. i want to run o from everyone and everything. why? i made stupid mistakes. i fucked up dinner by undercooking burgers. i made clam chowder that is too thin. no big deal??? yeah, to me it is. it is failures in one dinner. no that is not all... it is a series of stupid shit like that. i have had a few beers. which is certainly no help. just the mention of me getting in my car and fleeing wi will get me plenty of criticism. i live in a rural area and i am more likely to encounter a deer than another human being for many miles. i just want to be gone.	moderate
just so lost i can not even begin to explain this shit. i just feel like no matter how hard i try to be happy, i am just living in a grey mood of fake happy from smoking fucking weed all the ti ame. my lady told me she wants to die. she does not want to ki will herself because she does not want to leave me and the kids without her, but she says she had no reason to live. i can not afford to pay for her to talk to someone professionally. she does not want to talk about anything specific about the depression, just says she is sad. does not know why. and i fucking get it. i feel the same. just cruising by, same day after same day. no happy. no sad. just tired. emotionally grey. i do not know what to say to her when she says she is sad. it feels like i annoy her if i try to comfort her with hugs or saying i am here to talk. i do not know what to do, so i do not do anything. it is like, i want to help, but my fucking mind would not even try to help. just a droning uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh in my fucking head. i am sure the weed does not help, but if i quit smoking weed i turn into a giant fucking asshole because every emotion comes out as anger. so what the fuck man? how the fuck do i even begin to deal with this? somebody fucking help man.	moderate
i am a failure i am lonely. i can not talk to people. i get too nervous anxious and i can not take it for too long. talking to people is so taxing. i also never know what to say or how to say it, words come out wrong and i sound like an idiot. of course when i say that i can not stand talking to people, geniuses answer me with then why are you complaining about being lonely, you want to be lonely! no you dumbass. i wish i was normal so i could have what others have but i can not. i though things would get easier when i got older but it is the opposite. i have anxieties that i can not express because they offend, so i must keep them inside and they rot me. i do not feel much anymore, i do not look forward to anything. everything i try ends up in failure or worse.	moderate
i do not know why i do not do what i want, i do not know who i am hello, i wi will try to si amplify this post but it could be long i am a years old, and currently in college. i do not have much friends so i find it difficult to confide to anyone, and my parents used to be very strict and i usually perform well academically so i prefer not to let them down. so here i am here. i want to change myself for the better and i want to learn to care for myself what i want long term not short term . when people ask me what i enjoy doing, i say maths. i tried very hard in learning maths since and a half years ago, and the context is that i was preparing for a high level math exam. thinking back to the ti ame, i do not know if i tried so hard because i found maths fun, or because i just wanted to prove that i can achieve something i ampressive. another thing is since th grade i started to lose friends and i truthfully do not know why i lose friends, but it could be because i am too scared at making conversations. so in th and th grade i tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the ib higher level and further level maths. of course, during that ti ame i spent my free ti ame not revising and doing math in doing my own stuff such as watching ani amate, playing games, etc. however, i always try to take the hardest course in maths, so truthfully a part of me realizes that i do maths not because i like math, but i have some sort of ego and i want to prove to people around me that i am better than them. now, i reach the point where i took way too much challenging classes in university, and it is almost finals and i find myself playing minecraft and failing to control myself. someti ames people ask me if i want to do something or have something to do, and i say i am busy . then, i say to myself i should probably use that ti ame revising but end up playing minecraft or another game but i believe they are sti will the same idea . i thought i liked maths, so i am supposed to find it as fun doing maths as playing minecraft, but my subconsciousness just push me to play minecraft rather than do maths, and i play several hours without stop, even if i initially allocate a small amount of ti ame on it. so, here is questions i want to solve, and i want to ask if anyone can guide me to solving it . why do not i understand myself? how do i know if i really enjoy maths as itself? i am so confused even after years of learning a load of maths. . what do i want in life? of course i want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing i know i want is recognition and for others to love me, and this i am sure i want. i just know this because my whole heart feels happy when i get recognition. other than that, i really am not sure what i want long term. many ti ames i i amagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. another thing i want to say is i am sure i want to love doing math, but what if i do not love math in reality? it feels like many of my hobbies piano, chess, math are actually because i was forced or driven to do them in the past, but i do not even like them in reality, because i would rather play something like minecraft...	moderate

panic attack ruined a date i am feeling so shitty and do not know where to turn. i was sexually assaulted about years ago by my boyfriend at the ti ame, but did not realize it until about a year ago. we have been broken up for years, but i have not been in a serious relationship since. i went on a second date tonight with a guy i met on hinge that i was really enjoying, and as soon as things starting getting physical my mind flipped out. i completely spaced out and could not breathe. excused myself to the bathroom and could barely stand up straight. i was in there for a long ti ame and realized i needed to go home. i explained i was feeling panicky or whatever i said, and left. i feel so awful. i was actually having fun and up and left on hi am. i have had sex w other people since the assault and have not had problems, but some days it just grips me and today was one of them. i feel like i am never going to find someone, and am constantly in fear of being alone or my mental i willness trauma ruining my chances of future relationships. i hate it so much and just needed to get it out.	moderate
i hate this i feel so hopeless like no matter how hard i try at anything my anxiety just takes over and there is nothing i can do about it. i feel so frustrated and hopeless and worthless. i do not even deal with anything anywhere near as bad as anyone i have ever met or heard of their issues and yet all i can do is cry over my sorrow and helplessness towards myself. it is gotten so bad even wanting to tell my friends feels like an absolute waste. it is just the same issues i can not get over that ebb and flow in my mind. if i tell them what happened i know they wi will worry and they wi will tell me it is okay but i know i am bothering them i know all i am doing is wasting their ti ame and energy on my pitiful issues and it ki wills me inside. i feel guilty at everything i do. i can not stand this guilty sadness that comes basically every day over anything. i love them so much i do not want to make them deal with me but i love them so much i do not want to be away from them. it is so infuriating to not have control over my mind and what i am thinking of. my mind just spirals out of control from a small trigger of almost anything and i become a mess. i hate this.	moderate
i am doing pretty well in life right now, but i sti will feel like shit. i have been pretty depressed since october. i am in grad school and am doing well, i enjoy it. i have a boyfriend i live with in our own apartment, two cats, i am doing okay financially, and my prospects look good for after school is done. but i am sti will so depressed. i have been trying to find a therapist since january, but because i am on medicaid now, there are not a lot of therapists who accept my insurance and have availability. i have contacted like different places now and no luck. it is getting super thiscouraging. i also feel like i have isolated myself from friends i sti will have plenty of friends who i see semi regularly, but i am so horrible about opening up to them or just going to them for advice and i feel like i am drowning in my own head. i keep feeling like i am too type a to ever be in a relationship with anybody and it is making me want to self sabotage and be single and friendless for the rest of my life. but i know that is not really what i want, or what would make me happiest. i like having friends and i really do love my relationship, but my head is so fucked right now that everything feels wrong. i really just need to get a fucking therapist so i can just talk openly about this shit and get some actual perspective instead of just going in circles with myself and catastrophizing. but i do not know when that is going to happen and it is only getting worse. i am not suicidal or anything but i just feel so wrapped up in my head and it is causing me not to enjoy life and be in the moment, and i hate that. my bf is drunk and asleep next to me right now and i just needed a place to vent about this. i am just sad.	moderate

i need to write this i should write this in a journal, but i have found that dwelling too long is hard, and typing is a much faster mode of writing things out. so you do not need to read. most of it is incomprehensible and incomplete anyway. my therapist said today that when there is something i need to do that i tend to turn towards denial, until it is very close to a deadline and i end up putting myself into an anxious, depressed spiral. we made a plan for what i was going to do for the rest of the day and i have failed to follow through, which exasperates the spiral. i can not really talk to my friends, except one. but i do not feel like talking to them anyway. i am just in bed, watching videos, pretending that i am doing something. i feel fat, i feel tired by my own tiredness from sleeping, i feel hungry though there are thishes that i need to do before i can eat. it occurred to me a while ago that i am not really experiencing depression, but this is the only sub i can think of. i am self sabotaging, and if i stopped i wouldn t be feeling this. i would feel okay. but i do this to myself. i want to spiral to bottom. not really, of course. there is a quote from bojack horseman that is been rattling in my brain. he had bigger mistakes than me, and he did a lot worse things than i have ever done. but i have done shitty things, and i can not help but think how do you make something right when you have made it so wrong you can never go back? 	moderate

it is not your ti ame i know life is hard. it is unfair, unforgiving, and uncaring. there are ti ames where the weight of the world is too much to bare. where waking up is half the battle and getting out of bed is the other. it feels like regardless of how many people are around you telling you they love you, you have never felt so alone. maybe you think suicide is the way out. i can tell you with honesty that i feel the exact same way. every day is a fight to answer the question of if my existence means anything to anyone. i ask myself who would care if i died? i fight these demons every day. hell, it took a week to be able to say any of this here. but, here i stand, fighting this monster with all of you and there is something i amportant you need to know... it is not your ti ame. i have been crying for days in a row thinking about you. yes, you. the person looking at this and thinking of taking his her their own life. and how your life and pain mirrors mine. the facade you put on just to make it through the day. the hellscape that is your brain telling you you re incapable of being loved. that you have no worth or value to anyone in your life. but i want to let you know, you matter to me. your struggle, your sadness, i see you and you mean something. not just to me, and stay with me on this one, but to everyone your light or darkness has touched. the world needs you to live. you do serve a greater purpose. not cause god says so. but because somewhere within you, your light is sti will going. it may be di ammed, it may be clouded, the fog may be thick. but it is there. you can not die yet. i need you. knowing you exist let us me know i am not alone. and, as mortifying as it is, we share pain. and the idea of losing you would hurt me more than i already do. for me, for us, do not let go. it is not your ti ame.	moderate

help me i struggled violently with depression. my childhood was riddled trauma. i would not pretend that i suffered more than anybody else. ive read many books on mental health. i have done so much to change myself over the years. ive finally gained the courage to live past my burdens and use my pain as courage to step forward. i found purpose. i have decided that i wi will create a class in all schools focused around mental health. the focus wi will be to educate students on how to i amprove their mental health and how to i amprove their own lives. to anyone who knows even the basics on mental health and emotional intelligence. you should understand how much this knowledge can i amprove someone is life. how dramatic people can i amprove their lives if they use this knowledge. i know i can do this. i am absolutely certain that this wi will work. i just need someone to point me in the right direction. i am doing some research but i am no expert. i would like to reach out to a doctor who is a specialist in this field. tip help me get together the data and help me organize a pitch for schools to perfect a proper curriculum. i also need to know where to go with this idea. i am in tom is river nj. i figured going to town hall is a good start but who would i talk to? is it ok ti will pitch an idea there? i reached out last week to the principal of a nearby high school. he sti will has not responded. so i wi will keep trying. if anyone has any suggestions please do not hesitate, tell me anything you might know. if anyone tries to thiscourage me, do not bother. i am more stubborn than anyone you have ever met. and i am insane, i have the doctor is note to prove it. i would not stop. i know that this wi will help save some kids. even if i only help one. it is worth giving it my absolute all. if anyone knows a better subreddit for me to post this on please let me know. thank you all for your support	moderate
goodluck to everyone here. i am leaving r depression, i do not find it helping me in any way. like in real life there is no one to talk to, any ti ame i do get a response its negative, hateful, hurtful, it gets better or just do this like it is that easy. i feel as if you can not openly express yourself, not to mention i feel very low when i talk about myself or throw my problems onto others, especially since i know you re here and are suffering as well it is not fair to you. i see all your posts and i become more saddened that you are in such a spot and i have no words that can benefit you that others have not already said in a hopefully more intelligent and helpful manner. i just wish you luck in finding your way.	moderate

wtf is wrong with me... no one really talks to me anymore, besides at work. my own husband who is on deployment ignores me or just does not talk to me when i know he is just sitting in his room. almost every single one of my friends barely or does not talk to me even if i reach out... i feel so hated	moderate
this feels like a curse it just seems like i am always hitting a wall. whenever i try to do things that i should be doing in this life to feel more alive and like my mind is not tormenting me all the ti ame, it just backfires. all of my friends have something or someone going for them. i just feel blocked in every way. school, work, or romantic relationships do not work. in friendships i feel like the background friend. i am there only when i am needed and never a priority or favorite in anyone is life. my physical health keeps getting worse. every ti ame i think there is even a chance at something making me even a little bit happy it is violently snatched from me and i am back to wanting to ki will myself. i do not even know why i am sti will here. i guess i am fighting for this life, but i do not know. i feel like i can not get out of this hellhole.	moderate
i have severe depression but i make sure i shower daily. i have severe depression but i shower bathe twice a day to make sure everything on my body is clean, my very short hair and i go to the hairdresser to keep it short so i do not struggle cleaning and brushing my hair. i scrub behind my ears because who wants to put their hearing aids behind their dirty ears? i do not. i wash my neck, torso, arms, legs, back, feet. then i bathe and clean the rest of my body. anyone with lady parts down there, use vaginal soap that would not mess up your feminine ph balance. not regular soap. clean your entire butt, and no men guys it would not make you gay, same thing with cleaning your parts too. nobody wants to smell a dirty butthole. i am in my early is since some people would assume that everyone who wears hearing aid s are old grumpy people. news flash! anyone at any age can be hard of hearing or and deaf. there are babies, kids, teens to adults who wear heating aids cochlear i amplants. have a wonderful day.	moderate
i think i might ki will myself, but i am not scared for years i have been suicidal, and normally when i get close to doing it in start thinking about if it went wrong, if it hurt or if something really bad happened. but for some reason, i am not scared now. i am and yet i feel like i have lived enough of life to say it is not worth living for me, and honestly the only issue at the moment it how it would hurt. luckily we have vodka and pi wills in the cuboards, and so if i took all of them and slit my throat i might finish it. idk, for once i feel like i might be able to actually do it. and i am not scared, so maybe i wi will!	moderate
i hate myself i have struggled with my self i amage all my life. i have always looked at myself in the mirror thinking i was fat, ugly and unworthy. i spent my younger years letting people take advantage of me just to feel good about myself. this was at a ti ame when i look back now that i realised i was beautiful and thin. now years later i have gained weight and can not stand to look at myself in the mirror. i have been in a relationship with the same person for years. he tells me he loves me and that i am beautiful but no matter the words he tells me i just do not believe hi am. i can not even motivate myself to fix the things i hate. interacting with family, old friends, or even just trying to get the wi will to leave the house to seek help gives me crippling anxiety. this has become worse since i lost my job about a month and a half ago. i hide this from everyone around me fearing that they wi will tell me it is not true when i know it is. or worse, making me seek help when i know it would not do anything. some nights i lay there crying only feeling the intense pains in my chest. if i do sleep i have vivid dreams of loved ones telling me they are thisgusted by me and hate me. i am tired of living my life like this, i do not want to feel this way anymore but i can not motivate myself to seek help.	moderate
being depressed is not too bad i started coping with depression unhealthy when i was , turning to hard drugs, spent almost every waking moment of the last few years doing drugs. before then i dropped out of school at , became a severe shut in, had no motivation or wi will to do anything at all. the drugs gave me a reason to live, for more drugs, but i sti will had no motivation or wi will to do anything outside of drugs unless it would get me more drugs. i started selling drugs, it started out as selling weed to get by you know? but the real money was not in weed, it was in mdma. coke. heroin, fent, lsd. i started dealing hard to the point i was selling heroin to my mom and grandma so i could get high as fuck and forget about it all, seriously scummy shit and that is only the tip of the iceberg of the bad choices i have made the last few years to deal with this state of mind... i am tired of being a scumbag, i have come to understand this feeling and lack thereof feeling generally quite well. i think ulti amately, being depressed is not that bad compared to the alternative for some. you may think right now you re the biggest piece of shit due to your mind telling you so but i tell you the biggest pieces of shit? it is the ones who can commit the worst of gri ame and let it go straight off them, that is how i have spent the last few years, in a megalomaniac and narcissistic stir. make yourself a nice cup of tea, put on some good tunes and try to enjoy the good things in life in each and every moment. there is going to be a lot of painful valleys but there is a lot of beautiful peaks in life too. peace brothers...	moderate
i do not know what to do. while i am not depressed my sister is was. she is getting into the dating stage of her life in junior year, and so far she is had boyfriends that all cut it off in like a month. my sister is not at fault she is one of the most kind and caring people and to see these asshole break her heart not only pisses me off, but i am also worried for her. while she has not said anything along the lines of suicide or hurting herself, i can not help but feel that she is getting to a breaking point. she is fought her depression in the past and opened up to it but i am afraid she is going to down spiral again. as her big brother i love her and tell her everyday and i need help figuring out what to do for her. so what should i do?	moderate
i do not want to wake up tomorrow i have been losing interest in more and more things as ti ame passes. from hobbies to everyday activities. newest thing is sleep. i do not want to sleep even when i am exhausted even if i want the rejuvenation of sleeping, i do not want to deal with everything even remotely associated with the next day. i can never fix my sleep schedule and it is always skewed, leaving me waking up at am or pm. then the burdens of everyday life hit and i am instantly fi willed with sadness, anger frustration, and or anxiety and i am tired of it pun not intended . i finally understand when people say i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up or whatever along those lines	moderate

supposedly, we are all broke, just at a different level. my brother wants to cheer me up during my current unemployment. he says that a guy with a hundred thousand dollar car is just as broke as me. here just has a hundred thousand dollar car. well i return with the value that cast has in resale would give me a year to find another job. but, you are not seeing the point , says my brother. no, that guy is hundred thousand dollar car would sell quickly for dollars k and pay my bi wills for a year , i say. that is exactly why i am broke looking at homelessness and he wi will sti will be happy when his business fails. it is not like he really has his life at stake, just his comfort level. but you are not getting my point, happiness is something you choose. maybe when you have a hundred thousand dollar car it is. then he hangs up. yeah, delusional people love to believe that you are delusional. i am so sick of poor people defending rich people like they have any redeemable value beyond mulch after their money is removed. fuck capitalism.	moderate

in my own words... a smile is noted as a symbol of expression that can someti ames reflect happiness, confidence and positivity. there was this photo i took during my campaign running for city council, i was smiling, it was a ti ame where i could see god in the details of everything that was happening around me. i realized then that my path was not my own, understanding i was solely a vessel operating through the wi will of god. there was a greater purpose then even i could see for why i had been placed at this very moment in ti ame. what i did not anticipate and underesti amated were the struggles i would endure that were also a part of this journey. see, the last months in this position have literally broken me and the internal house i had been building started to come crashing down forcing me into one of the lowest points of my life. my smile was now fi willed with pain, confusion and a deep feeling of being lost. there are days i would cry out to god for understanding and comfort during these moments of despair. i never knew doing the right thing or lifting up god is people would be so hard. i am constantly faced with the realities of my own childhood and what my family had to endure just to survive in a world that had casted us out for the mistakes we made. there are days i do not want to wake up and unfortunately that is just my truth. as i self reflect, i am reminded of the statements i have uttered to others during ti ames like this, everything we have endured has prepared us for such a ti ame as this... or hold onto your faith and god wi will see you through it. as true as these statements are, it is something to be said about how these struggles can someti ames embody such a looming darkness you can no longer see even the flickering of light. throughout ti ame god has tested the least of these, as doubt is the greatest conqueror of all for it breathes fear and fear eli aminates the possibilities of faith. i am unclear of the path ahead, but every day i am reminded of the strength god has bestowed upon me to continue pushing forward. i realize now that there are things in my life that i wi will not be able to control, which is why having a relentless faith is so i amportant. you must learn to trust god within the entirety of your being and know that there is i ammaculate purpose operating within the moments of your uncertainty. it is okay to feel lost, because someti ames we must be lost in order to find our self. how else would we know if we are ready for what god is preparing us for without experiences designed to test our inner self spirit and purpose? it is within the essence of our divinity that god reminds us, no weapon formed against us shall prosper. we were created to experience this world and overcome the demons we may unconsciously keep suppressed deep within ourselves. our struggles become the catalyst to bring forth our true testi amony, a powerful story of transmutation and transformation, that becomes an inspirational example for others to realize their ability to overcome that which may seem i ampossible in their life. i have always said that our lives are not our own, even in the most selfish of ti ames, we are mere reflections of the possibilities within each other and we all contribute to elevating the overall consciousness in the world. i am here today as an example that there is nothing i have done that you too can not do.	moderate

sorry this is long. i have not been myself in awhile. hello. i do not know if i have depression because i have not been diagnosed or anything but i just know things are not right internally. i have not been myself in months and it seems like daily activities are becoming hard for me to do. my favourite part of the day is when i get to sleep, but i am not physically tired and can often only fall asleep around am. on nights where i know i need to sleep, i use benadryl to knock me out because i find my thoughts are making me restless. my mind is exhausting. it is like i am tired of hearing myself think. i use music to thistract myself when i am alone. i have sort of isolated myself socially too. i used to see my friends daily i am a university student but now it can go anywhere from ti ames every week or two. i spend a lot of ti ame by myself. i do not know why but it seems like i cry at any point nothing has to be triggering me, tears just form and that is that. i have been unhappy for a few months but never believed it to be serious. i have talked to a few counselors about anxiety which is something i have been dealing with for about years. it has gotten significan notly bad over the last few months. i just can not trust my mood anymore. it is very unstable and i find my thoughts spiral into either extremely great where i love myself or extremely low where i want to end my life. i do not want to use suicidal ideology infront of school counselors because i am aware they wi will have to break some kind of confidentiality. i just do not know what i am looking forward to anymore. the days and weeks just consist of me going to class if i can muster the energy to and somehow calm my thoughts of going and coming home. even when ti ames were bad, i never used to feel like this. i used to be and sti will appear to be a happy go lucky person who could find any reason to smile. i can be opti amistic and caring and sweet to others but lately i can not find this for myself. from an outside perspective i seem to be having a pretty good life. i have everything i thought i wanted but i have never been more miserable. i do not know how to tell someone else this. i feel like a fraud. i feel like i am living a lie. i feel like i want to thisappear. there are so many words i want to say but i find myself slowly becoming quieter and more reserved. i feel like hiding under a blanket and sleeping. i also feel extremely guilty because my parents have done everything to give me a good life. i have so many blessings in this life and am really trying to stay positive and be grateful for everything god has blessed me with. i just can not get rid of this feeling. always unstable and empty.if you re sti will reading, thank you.	moderate
what is wrong with me, why can not i just be a normal functioning person. why can not i just be a normal functioning fucking person. i am years old i have spent almost my entire life alone. i go weeks or months without human contact. i hate everything about myself i can not even hold a conversation for more than a few minutes without making things awkward and just leaving. i have an empty husk of a life, i hate it so much. i can not maintain relationships every friendship i make just falls apart a month or two later. the two ti ames i have tried dating in my life ended in thisaster. for some reason everyone keeps going on about how smart i am and that i wi will have some bright future, but i can not i amagine anything but working my life away until i die alone. i do not even feel like i am a real person someti ames i spend so much ti ame alone i have pretend coversations with people i have met a few ti ames. i have watched so many videos and played so many games i just feel numb to them now no entertainment does anything for me. i just lay around in my room, and only leave if i need to. i hate myself so much, i feel like i am in hell someti ames. i am so tired of my own exsistence. i sti will can not stop thinking about things that happened in middle school. i had so many big plans when i was a kid i wanted to go out and change the world i wanted to make things better for everyone. i do not know why i just have this constant feeling of guilt and self hatred. i self sabatoge constantly. as i type this i am failing my college classes and have midterms coming up and i havent studied at all. i do not know why i feel like i deserve all this for some reason, i feel like i do not deserve happiness, or love, or social interaction. i feel so thisconnected from reality that years feel like months. i have gotten angry over things that did not happen i feel like i have spent a lifeti ame alone with my thoughts. i have typed out messages on this a thousand ti ames, and i always delete it about seconds later. i am terrified of interacting with people but i do not know what to do i need to do something. i do not do this anymore, but i used to beat myself, like i made a switch out of a stick i found once and kept it for months. for every ti ame i made the most minor of social mistakes i would beat myself with it. then i started hitting myself after i threw away the stick. i do not know what to do i work at a mcdonald s, and i am just a broke college student who can not afford health care, or going to a doctor, or therapist, or counselor, and i have had past negative experiences with therapists. i feel like i go back and forth from feeling perfectly fine in my complete isolation, to pacing my room feeling like i am going insane. i do not know what i think i am accomplishing by posting this here, but idk maybe something wi will change if i do something different. i wi will probably just not use this account for a few days or a week or two because i am terrified of what people wi will say to me. i also had to try very hard not to but i have problems not lying almost constantly, i have so little going on in my life anyti ame i talk to anyone i half to just make everything up to make myself seem like a normal person.	moderate

stories from those who have been on medication here is a bit of background i do not have a lot of memories. even now, i struggle with recollection. i can remember inconsequential facts but i can not tell you what month my birthday is without counting on my fingers. my memories exist in fragments. my mother and father separated when i was young. i do not quite remember all the details. all i remember is constant fighting, both physical and verbal. my mum is a micromanager who took over my personal life, talking to my friends to tell them that she did not think it was appropriate for me to be friends with them. she had meetings with my teachers to make sure i was achieving at the level she wanted. she has a tendency to be i willogical, manipulative, headstrong, and unapologetic. i have grown up thinking i am stupid and slow contrary to what many work colleagues have told me. i believe i have undiagnosed adhd, anxiety and depression. i have being doing to at a good company for years and now want out, to either work part ti ame, or freelance. i have been depressed for a long ti ame, and working at this company is making it worse as i no longer have any motivation to learn. i am not sure whether i am depressed because i am working here, or whether my depression makes me not want to work here. when i am depressed, i can not bring myself to do any work or be a functional member of the team. i can barely turn on a light, or get myself a glass of water. i have lost a lot of friends through absentmindedness and lethargic behavior when this behavior manifests. i currently do not have enough ski wills to freelance. i have thought about quitting my job to learn some side ski wills as my current job requires overti ame and my anxiety is making it hard to be efficient and study after work. my boyfriend does not understand what i say when i say when i say i am sad, and i am also at a loss to explain how i am feeling. i cry for no reason during the peak of my depression, and feel much better after. i feel like i am going through everyday on auto pilot. i am looking to hear stories of those who have gone on medication. what were you prescribed and how did you feel after treatment? did the fog lift and were you able to think clearly?	moderate

people already mentioned having depression with no apparent reason. what is the best way to bring it up to a therapist? might be a stupid question, but it is one of the reasons i am currently not going to a therapist, besides the questions a therapist might ask me. which brings another stupid question is it possible to ask a therapist to just stick with clinical criterias for depression or would one absolutely need to expand on my personal feelings ? i mean, if there is no reason for one is depression, one should not really have to speak about his relationship with people or more inti amate things. one should be able to stick to it is been years and i am dead inside and i break down and cry randomly and frenetically and want to jump down every ti ame i see a train etc... do not want to sound like a difficult customer, but i do not know the dude and i tend to be defensive unless i absolutely need to make the effort to be more open	moderate
depression is a burden i have always reacted negatively whenever people bring their problems up. the reason why i had loved online friendships so much was because, just for a moment, i could goof around with someone. that i did not have to deal with my life of ambitions that are not. that i could lean back, shoot the shit about literature, or biology, or cute doggies, or the variability of tea, or clothing preferences, or how dumb i thought caterpi willars look. as soon as the topic came to depression, i would scamper away. i would turn off my empathy, and i would run. it is a matter of action i would say. instead of sitting around and whining, take the first steps to slowly repair yourself. it is difficult, it is hard. problems can not just vanish in a second, but one can slowly wind themselves out of it. and i sti will believe it. but while i sti will believe it, i also maintain this conviction within me not even i take my own advice. it is am. i have not touched a research paper in weeks. i have not started on a long project that i should be doing. i sti will do not have circles of friends, but merely thisconnected voices online. there is a single person online that i have spoken too longer than anyone else, that my ass has fallen for. but i can not confide in hi am. i do not mean confessions. i mean the fact that i just do not...want to grow up. i do not mean age or looks. but fucking hell, i am sti will that entitled child. i do not want to go to school. i do not want to pursue hobbies. i do not want responsibility. i do not want to do anything. even reading, the one thing that i have been doing obsessively for years, does not seem interesting. i just want to sleep. become a dumb kid again. i am not trying to defend my thoughts i have no choice but to go on. i admit it i do not want to do anything. just change your mindset i...i am trying. that self encouragement that is talked about. yes, orange, you can do it! see how fun this is? but orange, you re so dang smart. you come from a wealthy family, make perfect grades, have been called attractive multiple ti ames. i know. i am a privileged fuck. i do not have anything to complain about. it is pathetic, is not it? i have got all the shit in the world, and i sti will complain. tomorrow, i wonder how i wi will think about this post. i wi will scold myself for writing it. for admitting to something so abhorrent and i ammature. i wi will probably be over myself, this middle of the might extravaganza. but my loathing, at least, is true right now. i have been crying for an hour, starring outside. i should not feel like this. i have to do the things i do not like. i need to make friends. i know. i know i know i know. but i am rotten, and i want to never deal with anything ever again. i want to just lay here, in this little room, and never do anything again.	moderate
i been having a lot of serious thoughts so lately i been having sleepless nights of just me laying in the dark thinking about my death. i came to the realization that i am worthless. i have not had a good night sleep in weeks and it is really affecting how i do in school and sports. i tried all these medications but nothing really works on me anymore. i want to go see a therapist but last ti ame i did nothing helped. i am just in this loop of just thinking of these memories of my past of how shitty of a person i am. than i think of the solution of why i was a shitty person and it just comes down to me just die. i truly just want to be happy again but i have nice positive thoughts about myself and think that i wi will have a future after i turn . but i just do not know how to work with myself to make myself better. i tried to a lot of things to make myself better but nothing has been working. thank you for taking your ti ame to read this.	moderate
not over my ex boyfriend from years ago.... when i was a senior in high school, there was this amazing guy i fell in love with. he was sweet, and kind, he always put me first, but me being the idiot i was, i cried all the ti ame in this relationship. he always told me i was too clingy for wanting to hang out on weekends when we already saw each other everyday at school. he would lie behind my back about who he was hanging out with, so we did not have to hang out. and before he dumped me about a hour before he cheated on me with a friend of mine. i am over hi am as a person. but i am sti will hurting years later. i do not know how to explain it, i have been in relationships since then of course, but they never fulfi will me. i am not happy. i feel empty and scared that i wi will be hurt again and i push them away before i can get attached or them getting to attached. does anyone have any advice for my situation? please positive help only. thank you in advance. and yes he is blocked on all my social media, and he actually moved to a different state, but mentally i am not over the trauma. please also note i have thissociative identity thisorder. 	moderate

who do you go to when everyone ignores you? its fucked up when you do not have anybody to talk to, when you do express yourself those around you wi will never understand you. i am not suicidal but if someone was wi willing to take my life for whatever reason i wi will just let it happen, there is really no point of me trying. it seems like no matter what i do to move on with my life does not work. i have worked, had plans but things went left and i am once again caught up in some bullshit. recently went back to get into therapy and tell why this motherfucker said i do not see how you depressed like you smart and blah motherfucker i did not know i was supposed to be retarded to be depressed. people are really fucking stupid, reason why i hate talking to anybody. if you talk to family members they wi will use your words against you, i have shitty family who all they do is judge and treat me like shit. people wi will use you and get rid of you when they no longer need you. i am sti will trying to figure out why do i exist, i am not an alcoholic but drinking sure makes me feel better. is a fucked up world and i am really fed up, nobody wants to be around me so i might as well not be around. 	moderate

please help motivate me to see a therapist, get medicine, something. i have been crumbling the entire year and i can not hold up anymore. i am so broken. i do not have any friends. the person i have loved the most and i are going through absolute hell this year. i look at everybody as temporary amp fake because i plan on moving away in the future, which holds me back from making friends. i have a complete inability to connect with others, except the person mentioned earlier. found out i have hsv , which is not a huge deal, but sure fucking adds on to everything else. i stopped crying for a few weeks, but the last few days i have not been able to avoid it. tonight has been the worst. i do not know what to do. i feel helpless. help, please. i am miserable.	moderate
i do not know where i am heading life is just getting too hard, i feel weak. unable to do anything anymore. i am so unsure of everything and i do not feel myself. getting out of bed has become way too hard, i always feel tired even if i get enough sleep, i feel like i have lost all sense of reality i am really struggling. about a month ago my best friends dad passed away and it was extremely hard for me in all honesty. she had to move in with us and being an only child it feels like it has changed my life completely, i feel like i am stuck and so much is being put on me. the more and more we talk to the more thistant i feel to the world and i am struggling to come to terms with it. a couple months ago me and my ex broke up and i feel like i have lost my soulmate i feel so useless and worthless a lot of the ti ame like there is no point in my existence. like who would care anyway? i left the house today without anyone knowing and i just walked and walked until i just completely broke down, i was just sitting there so helpless. what really is the point, i eventually went back home but i am just not feeling the same anymore can anyone please help me? this really sucks 	moderate
 m does life always fucking suck? i have so much shit inside of me that i can not tell anyone about. i can not talk to my therapist, my friend group has more i amportant issues and i do not really think of them as friends anymore, more on that later , and i do not have anyone else. i am scared. a life that sucks this much is not a life that i find worth living, but i do not want to destroy my chances to help other people, no matter how much it sucks. the reason i do not think of my friend group as my friends is because we re all misfits. we do not belong anywhere else so we go there. we re friends out of necessity, and deep down, i think we all know that. but i can not leave, and i can not ask them for help, and my only other friend is the girl i told i liked months ago who used to be my best friend. now we barely talk. i am honestly just terrified of the future. i am not the type that makes friends easily, and i am a bit of an asshole. why the fuck can not i just be normal? i know people who do not fear the ti ame they are left with their own thoughts. why is not that me?	moderate
can fluoxetine stop me from waking up at the same ti ame in the middle of the night and not falling back to sleep after anxiety i have huge anxiety to sleep, both getting to sleep aswell as when i wake up in the night always at the same ti ame and i can therefore never get more than or hours of sleep. i believe the waking up is middle insomnia or something, caused by anxiety. can fluoxetine help reduce that, so that i can stay asleep and not wake up, which has been going on for weeks now.	moderate

existential crisis at it all started in august . i was feeling overworked and stressed in my job and had feelings of pressure that i was not achieving high enough so i applied for a new job within the company and although i had internal doubts that i would be able to keep up with the workload and amount of responsibility, i managed to ace the interview and was successful. only a month into the role i was not sleeping and contracted a severe double ear infection and was sti will going into work where i was unable to hear people asking me questions and was in constant pain. i was prescribed antibiotics, but they did not work so i was referred to a specialist who provided me with drops and i was signed off work. the drops cleared the infection but i was sti will having issues with my hearing, after seeing the specialist the second ti ame i was told that both of my eardrums had chronic perforations and that unless i had surgery i would not be able to hear properly again and there was a chance that even with surgery i would not regain the hearing i had lost. when i exited the hospital, i broke down in the street, i was sobbing into my sleeve as i walked, and i was at a total loss of what to do. i had been having negative thoughts for a long while, but i had been able to lift myself from them but now they seemed to be hitting me hard and i began to feel that life just was not worth living. i went home and kept having suicidal thoughts, i kept thinking of ways to end my life without affecting my husband financially, ways in which my death would look accidental in nature. i was home alone for weeks thinking about ways to end my life and i was hiding it from my husband. i did not want to hurt hi am, for hi am to see me as a burden in his life or for hi am to think i was weak and a failure. i kept receiving emails about my situation from work and weeks turned to months and i began to dread having to go to the doctor to ask for a sicknote which he was more than happy to provide . i lost all purpose and felt like there was nothing in life that i wanted to do. i would make comments about how the anaesthetic from the surgery for my ears might go wrong and then i would not have to think about any of this. it all came to a head when i was due to return to work and i asked my husband if he could see hi amself continuing with the same job and he said yes and i looked hi am in the eyes and si amply said i can not do it anymore. unfortunately, the ti aming of this was very poor as we were due to have guests around and he could see that i was in severe thistress, but it was too late to cancel. i managed to hold back and after the guests left, we spent the whole night talking, much of which was me sobbing hard about how i did not want to continue to be alive. my whole body hurt i had been trembling which meant my muscles were sore. my eyes were raw from the tears and from rubbing them. my throat hurt from the gasps of anguish and crying as i explained my issues. my husband took me to see my gp the next morning and i found it difficult to start the conversation. my husband began and as he told the gp he burst into tears and it broke me again. i do not think i have ever seen my husband cry. it hurt me to the core to see hi am so upset. the gp was shocked and i ammediately prescribed me with antidepressants and information for counselling and support. since then my mood has been up and down, i try to think about the future but its very hard to be positive or think of things i want to do or achieve. i hate being off work as it makes me feel like a burden, even though i was receiving sick pay and my company is supportive i just wanted to get it over with and continue with my life but the only issue i kept coming up against was doing what? i have no idea. the feelings of being a burden kept growing stronger, especially as i knew the sick pay would be reduced to half and then i would be financially dependant on my husband which i feel to be unfair and has never happened in the years we have been together. i have worked hard to try and find something i love enough to consider the possibility of doing as a career, but it is a real struggle. i also wanted to try coming off the medication in order to be less drowsy the following day so i could get more things done so i stopped taking it for two weeks . i decided that as i love ani amals, i would try home boarding as an option and in order to relive myself of the pressure to return to my old job i handed in my resignation. my employer was very reluctant to accept the resignation but i honestly did not see me ever being able to return to that role and if i did i am sure that the feelings would build up again and i would end up in the same position. my first experience of home boarding was awful, within an hour of receiving the dog i felt pressured, stressed and anxious so much so that i ended up in tears and back on my medication, i was constantly berating myself. the owner stated the dog was house trained and friendly to other dogs i have two dogs myself but this was not true, and i was having to juggle a very energetic ani amal with my own pets. my husband kept offering to help but as he had been working all week, i kept telling hi am no, that this was my responsibility as he had already done his working week. but i could not cope. the dog managed to run upstairs and peed on the spare bed which again caused me to get upset. the dog was uncontrollable, unresponsive to commands and not house trained the idea to be a home boarder now felt horrible and i recalled handing in my notice and asking myself what have i done? the dog also had separation anxiety and i did not want this to affect both me and my husband so i slept in a separate bed with the dog in the room, shushing it every minutes and hoping it did not rip up the carpet, skirting, door or anything else. needless to say, i did not sleep well that night. the next day i asked my employer if it would be possible to rescind my resignation and assign me to a part ti ame position, on a lower grade with lesser responsibilities but as i have offered my resignation it is up to them if they accept this. i know my husband wi will support me to find a new job, so this is not an issue for me, but i sti will feel reckless for just leaving to try something new without having tried it first. i guess it is a lesson learnt. in all this ti ame i have been on group therapy sessions, received counselling and have used the support service shout! and have been more open about my feelings with my husband when i am having a particularly bad day. i realised how much i love to write, and i am now considering looking at this as a possible career in the future. i am going to take one day at a ti ame and explore the opportunities i have available to me and i wi will go back to work even if it is part ti ame whilst i decide what i really want to do. i can not say that i am cured but i do feel that i have made some progress. without talking to my husband as scary as it was or going to my gp to seek support, i do not think i would be here today. i urge anyone who has felt like i have, to seek help. it is scary, but it is worth it you are not alone in this and there is always someone to talk to.	moderate
i always get the be more physically active advice... all the advice i get to help with my depression seems to be about physical activity and that is fine, but it is not exactly helpful all the ti ame. i am reasonably active most of the ti ame, in an effort to help, my recurring depressive state, but i also find that being hardline with myself also ratchets up the feelings of suicidality and self loathing. like i am trying to punish myself for being depressed, as if punishment would make the dark feelings go away. anyone else get this? btw i got a bit of a boost by being social and playing d amp d last night with my friends. it felt safe and engaging even if also felt a bit superficial. i just wanted to share that... i found some light, for a ti ame, before feeling low er again today.	moderate
my dad died last sunday. they actually think it was around thursday but did not find hi am til sunday. he died of congested heart failure which my uncle died of almost years ago to the month. he was having a lot of health issues and was going to see a doctor last thursday but died before that ever happened. i had not talked to hi am in almost years. i am now and have not seen hi am since i was . we were best friends when i was a kid but kinda grew apart as i got older as i live in arizona and he lived in washington state. i guess the longer it got the harder it got to pick up the phone. i now hate myself for not reaching out. he was only . i just want to hug hi am and tell hi am sorry but that wi will never happen. it is weird after not talking to hi am for so long. never thought i would miss hi am this much. i feel so lost and alone. not even sure if anyone is going to read this but just had to tell someone. i have not been able to sleep. i have work in a few hours and i am just lying in my bed bawling my eyes out. i just want it to end so i can see hi am again.	moderate
a technique that wi will change your life. the greatest thing you can do for yourself is to start loving yourself because you are the greatest thing to exist. this is your reality. you are living person with thoughts and personalities of your own. its the only thing you truly have if everything was gone so why would you hate yourself. why would add negativity and hurt the one thing that you wi will always have. its you. now this technique is based off the law of attraction. positive thoughts attract positive. negative thoughts attracts negativity. if you want to change your life, you got to start thinking positive no matter how hard it is for you it has to be at your core. even if you do not believe in the law of attraction what sounds better being negative, thinking about horrible things or thinking positive feeling good no matter what situation you are in. the technique play your favorite music or pick a song that makes you happy, uplifting, calm does not matter pick music that makes you feel happy, tranquil, etc. me personally, i play traditional chinese music, japanese piano music, heck someti ame i even type happy music on youtube. what matters the most is it makes you feel good. play your music and just let go. start i amagining and believing everything that you want in life you have it already. the feeling of being complete and loving yourself. some things i think about i am sexiest mothefucker out there, i have a perfect life, i am in perfect health, i am the greatest of all ti ame. i am blessed. you should be feeling this loving energy near your heart. it feels good kinda blissful. just let go and feel that you have everything. you are not thinking about anything negative. its basically metta meditation. the longer your session the better it is for you. soon you wi will start seeing changes with your life. everything starts with you. this technique wi will make you a more positive person and you wi will start feeling happy for no reason. you wi will start spreading love instead of taking it because once you truly love yourself. you become a beacon. a beacon of love and people wi will be attracted to it. good things wi will start happening. even if this sounds crazy, would you rather do nothing and wi willow in despair or give this weird thing a shot.	moderate
am i just sad? so my initial post was to tell my story, how i recently lost my faith, unemployed, single let down every ti ame and whatever else i could drag in to paint the picture. i never understood depression growing up but did not hear much about it also. i even had a friend at tell me she was depressed, i sti will think she was just sad but how would i know, i did not live in her brain. it makes me so sad to know there are people out there who feel like this because i know how consuming a feeling can be. i feel sadness often and i tried to always chalk it up to something else because how could i be depressed? i was always trying my hardest to laugh and have a good ti ame. so whilst i know sadness and depression are not the same, i have tried to sit on the fence of sadness so as not to crawl into a whole new scary world depression. i feel really empty and have for a while, not being around often ski ams my mind because the pain is not worth feeling again. i do not know how i have even made it this far. i do not want to return calls at the moment and may lose people in the process but hey, it is a risk my brain is wi willing to take. i smoke weed and have a drink when i can. my mum kind of notices the drinking but i do not think she realises that i have purchased alcohol before, consumed it in my room and waited to throw it out so there was no evidence. that is not normal right. the weed and alcohol does not even numb the pain. i wouldn t move onto anything stronger but it is interesting to see what others have said about these things no longer working after a certain ti ame. it is like the pain is determined to win. i know i am venting and waffling. i do not really know if i am depressed, probably need to be diagnosed, i do not know the rules. all i do know is i fear that the strength i once had is dwindling and i am scared of life because my ability to cope is no longer there. wouldn t even know where to start right now so here i am...	moderate

lack of understanding i recently had to move back home after an on goingg depressive episode, one that i am sti will struggling with every day, and i feel like my two younger brothers just dont care or understand that i am in a very fragile state right now. to preface, i am and they are twins and we have all always been very close. i had a moment where i tried to explain to them both, and warn them, that i am very emotionally unstable and that little things can set me off right now. i am trying to push through this and wait for my appointments with a psychiatrist and therapist i have soon, but it is so hard just to act normal and smile and i feel like they dont really care about my feelings. even today, i was driving them to the movies to meet the rest of our family and they kept giving me shit over little things like my parking job or waiting to long on a yield turn, to the point i feel like shit and want to cry, but they just keep laughing and screwing around. i just wish that they would he more kind about everything, it is hard enough just trying to act human and get better without having their attitude and stubbornness on top of it. i just feel like no one understands how i feel and it is almost suffocating how much i want just one person to get it.	moderate
had a shitty, anxiety fi willed day and boyfriend ended it even worse all day, i had an overwhelming feeling like i was about to die. not from i willness or pain, i just have really bad irrational fears from ti ame to ti ame, and this ti ame i thought i would just stop breathing at some point. it gets especially bad if i forget to take my antidepressants regularly i hate the pi wills so much , which of course i did not this past week. that one is on me. but a few hours ago, my boyfriend tried to call me and talk me down from freaking out. we talked about nothing in particular for a bit til it came to a conversation about what he did yesterday night. he is been hanging out with two female coworkers a lot recently. they go out to eat and shop which he usually hates , which is a little weird to me, but i was fine. but a few hours ago, he was telling me some things that did not add up. he said he found out he was allergic to alcohol, but he is underage. i asked hi am about it and he said he tried a couple shots. where did you get alcohol from? he said he stopped by to say hi to his manager on his way home and she offered hi am alcohol. wait, but weren t you driving your two female coworkers home that night too? yes, they were there and they drank and got wasted haha. but you drank, and you were the driver. and you told me you got home at . did you drive drunk? a pause. i may have lied. he told me that he actually went to his manager is house party. with his co workers that he spends a lot of ti ame with. he drank and hung out there until in the morning. he says he drove the two girls home, went to his own house, and drove back to take one of them to work in the morning. i might be too sensitive, but i had a horrible day overall and this stressed me out more. why are you taking out two girls to do the things you do with me and more? if that was really all that happened, why lie about it to begin with? you re so eager to tell me about all the other dumb shit you do. it is am and i can not sleep. because i sti will do not think i wi will wake up if i do.	moderate
i do not know if i am depressed or what i do not want to call myself depressed because there is people out there who have depression and i do not want to be someone who says they have depression even if they do not. i have done research online and shit and i can not find anything with a solid answer. some places say i am depressed and some places say that i am not depressed. months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me and is currently getting back with her ex, and every day i think of her. i am jealous and upset all the ti ame and would do anything to get her back. whilst we were dating, she used to occasionally speak to her ex online, i did not mind because i trusted her, i had no problem with her casually speaking to other men. but the problem was that the day she broke up with me, she was speaking to hi am online. so whilst i am there crying my eyes out, she is speaking to hi am and i do not know how i feel. it is like she never wanted to be with me in the first place. things were going so well between us, we hardly argued and we did not have an argument or so months prior to us breaking up. i do not feel happy anymore, like it used to be the case where i was always happy and i would have the occasional bad day but it is the opposite now, like i am always having a bad day and there is only a few moments when i am happy it fucking sucks. i have never been depressed before. i used to self harm a bit maybe like years ago but i stopped for a while, but i never felt depressed and i had no reason to self harm, but i am just getting all these feelings all at once, and i am not sure if i can say for sure if i am depressed or not, but i have not been happy for a whole day in months, and i feel like my girlfriend never loved me because of the situation with her ex. i feel betrayed and alone and the only thing that makes me happy is hanging out with my friends which i can not do because they do not want to hang out half the ti ame. i am failing one of my courses in college because of my social anxiety and i would not be able to pass so i have to speak to someone about that. someone help me please. i do not know if i am depressed or if it is too early to come to a conclusion, i just want to understand myself and i want to know why i am feeling all these things.	moderate
just found out it gets better. life fucking sucks and it is really hard to keep a positive mental attitude all the way through it. after wanting to ki will myself in february and going through other events such as the death of my dog, i can comfortably say that it gets better. you ll never get rid of the bad thoughts, they just get less and less prominent until they are basically unnoticeable on good days. if you have a bad day it is ok. if you do not reach that goal you had and fall down, it is ok. as long as you get back up when you can, there is no shame in falling. hang in there guys.	moderate
i wish other is could understand what it is like to be us i wish they could understand how hard it is to get up and do things. i wish they could understand that i can not get up really means that we physically can not get up, if only i could make them feel what i feel, that feeling, the feeling of being pulled down to the ground, like being submerged in thick mud, the feeling of emptiness in our chests that never subsides, like a void that is slowly consuming our soul from deep inside our chest. i wish i did not have to suffer for every minute of the day.	moderate
why am i like this i am laying in bed next to my partner that loves me so damn much, and all i want to do is die. she makes feel so safe, i am crying all the ti ame because i am scared one of these days i am going to hurt myself but someti ames i see no choice. people would be better off if i was gone. i know they would be sad, but people move on. my mom moved months ago right after i graduated college and i miss her everyday, but can not even pick up the phone to call her because there is a constant stream of trauma playing in my head . i used to love life, someti ames i do for a day or a week or a month, but then the same sinking feeling hits me. i do not know how much more pain i can take. my insides hurt everyday, i just want to feel good again. suicide causes so much trauma, my cousin ki willed hi amself years ago and it was devastating, but i understand why. when the pain inside you would not thisappear, it is debilitating. idk if i could ever go through with it, but i am and i have felt this way for yrs	moderate
just another night another night goes by as i am laying in bed at am in the morning, thinking about pointless everything is going to be no matter how hard i try. everything leads to death anyway, all we go through is pain, yeah there are some good things in life, but then your always going to get slapped in the face by more pain. i am already trying to fight this i ammense pain that is eating its way inside my chest, i am trying my best to keep the loud voice in my head away, but he keeps telling me to just die, telling me how worthless i am, telling me how everything wi will be better off if i am dead, and i can not fight it because i know it is true, because i am the voice in my head. just why? what is the point in trying? what is the point in living? i am tired of living and i just want to go and drift away into a big empty of nothingness yeah this does not make sense, i just do not care . i want it all to stop, please just stop.	moderate
a speeding bullet to heaven would be nice i can not live in a world where you exist, i want the pain to go away so maybe i should just slit my wrists ... watch the tub fi will with my dna, realest thing you have ever seen. now i have created a chaos scene. i departed, so no blame on me. this is what it is like when the good guy dies in the movies. bunch of confusing mixed feelings. tears may shed, but it is not because you miss me. it is because you feel sorry for me, i wish i could feel worthy. but maybe i am unholy, makes sense that christians look down upon me. they do not like a dark minded writer, y all can sue me. i am a broken spirit, so do not expect anything uplifting. i am just like the holocaust, fi willed with endless tragedy. it is so unnerving. even my loved ones are turning against me. so what is the point of living? i rather take this glock and blow my brains to smithereens. have my conscience looking like uncooked meat, hence i am raw as can be. unfiltered, so i see no hearts on my screen. makes sense why my vision is blurry, because my future is forever thistorted. never wi will it be in hd.	moderate
do you ever just feel good feeling sad? what the title suggest, i have these moments usually late at night when i watch streams or replays of video games half asleep while listening to these deep sad edm trap songs. and it just feels good feeling sad. i couple of months ago i tried to avoid doing this because it just brought up thoughts that i was not ready to face. but ever since i made peace with myself. every ti ame i do this it just feels good to feel, like the music drains all my built up sadness that i am nit capable to share with the world for one reason or another. would recommend trying if you already faced your demons but sti will having troubles.	moderate
to make you more happy a lot of people these days do not feel happy. so i decided to help the people that are not feeling happy. not being happy can have many causes therefore i can not guarantee that the method that i am going to explain wi will help for everyone. first of all i want to say that i do not recommend you to suppress your emotions. feeling emotions can be helpful in many ways. it can for example tell you that you do not like certain things or that certain things need to be changed. but as a child probably almost everyone told you i want you to be happy . therefore you started to feel bad if you did not feel happy. so you feel even more bad than you did before. but like i just said, your emotions can be helpful in many ways. so you do not have to feel bad about it if you are not happy. in today is society most people are raised in a way that they start thinking constantly. and if you observe these thinking patterns you start to see that most people are just repeating their thoughts over and over again. and at a point they even start thinking about their own created thoughts that they are repeating over and over again. therefore they have nothing to think about except thoughts. and then there comes a point that they are just living in their head. and because of that they are not seeing the beauty of life anymore. people can go to work everyday and if you ask them for example did you see the appletree at the side of the road when you was on your way to work? they wi will probably say no i did not see it . so they are just caught up in their thoughts not experiencing life anymore. so try to sti will your mind, by for example meditation if you want mediation techniques, feel free to ask, you can even send me a dm quintenvanommen. once your are not caught up in your thoughts anymore you can start experiencing life again. on your way to work you can see the appletree, you can see the apples, you can see the apples falling. and if you eat you are just eating. your are experiencing the apple or whatever you are eating. and than if you drink afterwards a cup of tea for example. just drink the cup of tea and taste the tea. once you are doing this you wi will experience life again, and you wi will probably become more happy. have a nice day yours sincerely, quinten van ommen	moderate
i have started realising that the more you re depressed, the less you care about stuff around you i have been skipping days at work, arriving late, doing things i usually wouldn t and basically avoiding to do work because i am just so done with everything, same with university, i skip class all the ti ame and i have not done a single homework, heck i have not even studied for exams. i do not hang out with people and i am basically alone all the ti ame, it is this vicious cycle that honestly feels like it is going to be the end of me soon. i wi will get fired and kicked out of uni, i would not have any friends, i barely care to even try and i am just hoping my life is taken away somehow. really dumb rant and i apologise for it, but this has been my situation lately and i had to let it out	moderate
i got shamed by a psychiatrist for getting depression after being bullied for almost years he was like people do not usually get depression from that and you re not like your peers, you need to chi will , most of your peers do weed . he then proceeded to call my parents and tell me everything because he said it looked suspicious. on top of that he charged so much money that i could spend in shopping 	moderate
i do not know what to do with myself or my feelings at this point i feel so fucking alone and helpless to do anything about it. i broke up with my girlfriend a year ago. we were together for about a year. prior to her, i never had any kind of relationship or romantic experience with anyone. and, in the year since we split up, i feel like i have gone in the opposite direction. i am almost . i finished college and grad school. i work full ti ame and study for actuarial exams and go to the gym. besides that i do nothing. i have no active social circle where i wi will ever meet anyone. my co workers are pleasant but i do not talk to them about anything besides work and i do not want to. there is just nothing. i live in a big city, in a high rise apartment building downtown. i am surrounded by people and i feel so fucking isolated and atomized. when i tell my therapist stuff like this, she says it sounds like you want conection . and i have not had the guts to say that is not it. bc the truth is i do not really like having or spending ti ame with platonic friends. even my friends who i liked most, who i respect and admire the fuck out of as people i do not miss spending ti ame with them. i am just not someone who needs that. the only thing i want in the world is a girlfriend i like. yesterday i met some girl just in passing. she initiated conversation i would never just bother a stranger in public because they are hot. it was in the elevator of my apartment. i made up an excuse to ask to talk with her more at a later ti ame, gave her my phone number, and we parted ways. she could have easily not texted me. but she did. i gave a basic, innocuous reply, and she is said nothing since. and i want to be clear she does not matter. not her, specifically, anyway. she is just some pretty girl i do not know. but the hour i had yesterday where i felt some kind of hope that i might actually get the thing i want was insane. i forgot what it was like to feel like a human being who did not actively want to die. now the sense of hopelessness is so much stronger. in the space of a year, that was the one ti ame i met someone who i was interested in and felt i could possibly end up dating. and it was either doomed from the start, or i fucked it up somewhere along the way. either possibility is equally devastating. and i do not know what to do with these feelings right now. i could not fall asleep for hours last night, thinking about this. then i woke up after hours and could not go back to sleep. all i can do now is stare at my computer, do nothing, and be on the verge of crying. i have shit i need to do. i need to study. i promised my family i would come see them for my birthday today. i can not do it.	moderate
i missed out on prom a few weeks before everyone was excited to go and i was excited too i forgot that i have no friends, i am the quite and depressed kid and if i went i would probably be standing in the corner. i fucking wish i was normal everyone had fun i am a loser because of my depression and anxiety. i someti ames i amagine i have friends while i am actually a lonely loser.	moderate
i feel like suicide is the only way to right my wrongs first of all, hello to anyone wi willing to read this. low key expect this to get buried, and i am also running on terrible sleep so bear with me i am m and have been feeling this way for a long ti ame. the i ammense guilt that i feel has been ripping and tearing at me. it is been this constant voice in my head that is a painful reminder of who i am, and the suicidal thoughts just feel like a premonition into what is to come. all of my failures seem to pile on to each other, mesh together, and the stick to my heart, draining me of any wi will to live i have left. my failure to date my crush without being an anxious moron, my failure to keep my cool someti ames, my faliure to live the childhood i was told was good to have. all of these and more get to me. i just feel like ending it all is the way to tell the world i am going to pay for my sins with my blood . i feel like if i dont ki will myself, then i wi will just be lying when i say i am sorry. i wi will say i wi will never do it again, but if i am not here, i wi will not have the ability to do it again, or do anything else to anyone ever again. not only all of this, but recently that old crush of mine just got a boyfriend, so i have been taking that extremely hard. i just feel like i wi will never be able to love anyone else. i just feel like that relationship wi will be eternal, and i wi will be left here to rot. its what she deserves, and this is what i deserve. she is a major cause of my pain, but its all self induced. i caused the reason we re not together, i am her first experience with any guy even if that experience was date long . everyone who i have told my story to, including her, from my friends to my therapist have told me that she does not want me dead, and i am blowing this out of proportion in my head. its something that i have an extremely hard ti ame internalizing and accepting, because i feel that its just a front to cover up how they truly feel. i noticed that hurting myself alleviates some of the pain. its like as the sharp edges of whatever i am holding take the hurting feeling from the mark into this vault, that wi will build up over ti ame until i have enough pain credits to finally be able to be forgiven. suicide, in this case, would be the capstone. the trump card. the bailout of all bailouts. finally, i would be free. finally, my debt would be paid. i feel it coming. when? i am not sure. i can not eat. i can not sleep. i can not think. i can not socialize. i can not love. i can not laugh. i can not cry. all i can do is wait for me to muster up the courage to slide the knife into my throat.	moderate
nothing can help me fi will the void anymore. do you guys know what being so damn hopeless feels like? i am . i am sti will a student and live in my parents house. where i am from it is quite normal to live with your parents until married though. it does not change the fact that it makes me feel like a failure and a burden. i can not talk to people, no matter how fucking hard i try to act like i am normal and okay. i stutter, can not spit out a single sentence that makes sense and just overall make myself look like an absolute moron. i am not the worst student but i am far from being good. lately, i have been skipping a lot of classes because i feel like i am just embarrassing myself by coming to the university. i can not stop thinking about the fact that everyone might laugh at me and think that i am dumb. when i actually show up, i either barely talk or when someone actually wants to talk to me i overshare like a dumb bitch and make a fool outta myself. i just want to stay in bed all day. nothing makes me feel okay anymore. i used to love books, now i can not focus enough to read. i used to love music but now playing guitar just makes me tired. i self harm on a regular basis now. cutting is not enough anymore though. i pull my hair out, scratch my hands until they bleed without even noticing. i feel thisgusting. i could stare at my damn ceiling for hours and just think about all the ways that i could harm myself. i am a waste of space. a burden to my parents, my friends, probably just a laughing matter for other students at my uni. nothing can help me fi will the void anymore.	moderate

i have literally never put in effort and gotten anything meaningful out of it people want me to get things done, and to strive for better, but why should i? i have no reason to believe anything wi will work out well. i got kicked out of my last high school for bad grades, and almost got kicked out of this one which is much easier for basically the same reason. every ti ame i try to make friends or talk about my feelings i get shot down or thismissed. nobody truly cares about me for who i am. the only people who care about me do it because they are supposed to . like my friends from when i was a little kid, or my family. well the truth is i am a leech. i do not deserve the respect i get and i contribute nothing. i used to have ambition to be a father when i get older, and to have a family. but why should i have that dream? why do i have any reason to believe i wi will be successful? i can not support myself, let alone anyone else. even the little things my mom makes me do around the house drain me of everything i have. how am i supposed to try with anything, when i know i am only being set up for failure? why should i accept help from the people around me when i wi will only thisappoint. why do i care about anything? why am i posting on here? i have no idea. maybe i can find some people who have common feelings. i am desperate for anything. hope.	moderate
going to break so i have no idea where to go on this app for this, figured this would be a good spot. maybe some of you can relate. i am a father of , i am struggling to keep my sanity. my youngest cries so much, he is been doing this for over a year now, if my wife take a step out of the room he is freaking the fuck out.... drives me insane. i can not pick hi am up due to a surgery. not that picking hi am up does anything anyways. my oldest would not let hi am play in the same room which makes hi am cry even more so. anyti ame my wife and i try to have alone ti ame they always seem to ruin it. we literally do not get a minute away from them. i know it is not their fault our oldest would not sleep in his own bed, he is been in ours ever since we had our second. so basically everything keeps compounding and i am just getting more and more depressed, things that wouldn t normally bother are bothering me.	moderate
false sense of happiness hi guys, i do not really know where to start. i used to go to free therapy at campus last year, but as i am graduating i am no longer able to continue my sessions. i am f, graduating in april and currently looking for a job. i have been dealing with depression since highschool and recently it is become all consuming. i have a narcissistic father, and a mother who is both enabler victi am everyti ame i try to show her my dads shitty ways she turns around and tells me that emotional and verbal abuse is normal in a relationship and that i am idealistic for thinking that a relationship would not have abuse in it. i thought that after highschool i would go to a university where i would live on res etc but ended up going to university that was mins from home so i ended up living with my parents sti will. i have always known exactly what i wanted in my life, how i want to live it etc but recently it seems nothing is going the way i thought it would and every attempt to making my dreams seems to face some obstacle and yet everyone else is lives are moving forward without any hindrance. it almost feels like i am being singled out in life and i am being specifically held back i mean i have not even had my first kiss or any romantic experience. i am generally an opti amistic person and usually look at the bright side of things hoping it would get better but i always end up being let down or thisappointed, happiness is so fleeting for me that whenever something good happens, something twice as bad happens almost like i can not be happy without suffering or paying a price for it. idk what to do. i am job hunting and that probably means a couple of months i wi will be unemployed but i hate just being at home. i feel dead inside like i can write off my life before it even starts. thanks for listening	moderate

i am broken hello. my name is kira and i am in my early s. my life is falling apart. my year relationship is falling apart. i can not do anything for myself because i depend on my bf so much. i gained weight so much to the point where i can not even look at myself anymore. i am not myself anymore and its scary. i try to cope by drinking and smoking and it just seems to hurt me more. i cry myself to sleep because i hate myself. i am broke. i can not even get a job and i can not do anything for me. i am upset because i let myself get into this dark place and i can not talk to anyone about it. my father abandoned me and my mom has a drinking problem. people i went to school with stare at me because of my appearance and how far ive fallin off. i ask myself... why me? why is this happening to me. idk what to do.	moderate
today is one of those days where i can not remain afloat. it is been months since i broke up with my so whom i have known for over years and dated for about months last year. my anxiety got the better of me and everything crumbled eventually leading to several complications in our relationship. i am fine with the breakup i knew it was not heading anywhere and secretly wished it ended because we wouldn t have sustained it in the long run. what hurts is losing a friend, somebody who was always there for you, knew you onside and out, loved and cared for you and i always reciprocated that love and affection two fold. she was someone who knew what was on my mind before i even said anything, the kind who understood your silence, you can say she was the one. the girl every guy dreams of having as a partner. but i blew it and i am okay with it but i am not okay with not having her in my life at all. i am cut off no contact for life! if we can not be in a relationship atleast we could sti will remain friends? god knows how many ti ames i must repeated this line begging and pleading her to stay. i am left with a void that i am trying to fi will by giving my best at work, trying to help out friends and colleagues, organising trips for office, listening to music podcasts, watching tv shows documentaries, flirting with women on the internet, making memes, trying to make each day count but it is just not enough... sooner or later the guilt returns, the regret returns, and it dampens your spirits. during this moment all you can do is stay sti will and let it suck you in and spit you out after a couple of days when its done with you.	moderate
fed up of being patronized by parents and teachers it really frustrates me when my parents lecture me about organization, my dad earlier literally told me the definition of the word whilst i am sitting in a room full of mess. i know he means well but its really embarrassing when he treats me like a little kid who doesnt know anything, or like a lazy person that doesnt care. because i do!! i want to tidy my room, but i am depressed and i am trying hard in other areas to i amprove. and when my spanish teacher yelled at me for not being good enough and told me how surprised she was at my lack of efforts and tried to mock me and make me feel bad, i know they are just doing their job but it makes me want to punch the wall. because spanish is actually my favourite subject and i am really interested in it, and i want to do well so bad but getting a piece homework done in a week was too much for me. but these people make me feel bad for something i literally can not control, because they have power. and i can not even tell them i am depressed. because that is just not what you do. so i have to keep struggling on my own and being yelled at unfairly and keep it a secret.	moderate
i am afraid i indirectly murdered my girlfriend very long post trigger warning this is the fourth ti ame i have tried to write a post about my situation but each ti ame it came out extremely messy and hard to read. that is why i am going to try to divide my post into different sections this ti ame in an attempt to make grasping everything easier for you the reader and myself to be completely honest. the sections the relationship her situation depression my final decision the relationship my girlfriend and i started dating years ago at back in high school. we have had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. maybe i am just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest i wouldn t have wanted it any other way. we used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. thinking back i do regret this a lot. due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. it is crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them. in high school we used to spend almost everyday together and i loved it this changed after we went to college. when we graduated high school she went to sweden for weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. i sort of started thisconnecting and getting used to having more space. after she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. this took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication. everything changed when this happened however. around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. i did this for a long ti ame but eventually relapsed around ti ames in the span of a year and never told her. she eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, i confessed and everything just went extremely downhi will from there. she was really hurt and even more so about the fact that i hid it from her and was never planning on telling. we broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. her trust however was never the same and rightfully so . her situation depression my girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at due to her birth control pi wills. i have been supporting her ever since. the first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pi wills she saved up. i called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. there was a big problem however when she came home. after hating me for a couple of days and wishing that i did not call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. it turns out that she was a gypsy, a romani. and in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. now its but it used to be a lot younger. and it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. i always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent i never asked any questions about why they could not know about us but now i knew. she always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long ti ame. her mother father is out of the picture did not believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. she also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services. she eventually made the choice to run away with me. but she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. a lot of the ti ames she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. a loveless probably abusive arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. she convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. i talked her out of it so many ti ames and truly tried supporting her through everything. this took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive. everything changed when i cheated however. she told me in the weeks that we broke up that i was the reason she was going to die and i was her only chance at a normal life. i tried to convince her otherwise but she just would not listen. after we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she is just waiting for the right ti ame. when i begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and i get to choose to be with her ti will the end or leave. when i asked why she said because i cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway. i thought i could change her mind at first but i can not. i honestly do not know what to do anymore i see a future with this girl but she does not with me. i told her i am going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. i can not sit there and be with her until she dies. i do not understand how she wants to take me back after everything but does not want to run away with me anymore. i am confused tired and stressed out. i have never talked about this with anyone and i just need to hear someone else is opinion on this. my final decision i sti will havent decided what to do and told her i want to think about this long and hard. she told me i was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. i really need some advice. i really do not want to be a temporary comfort for her i just can not. i love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. i would permanently lose my sanity if i stayed i am afraid but i also do not want to leave her like this. i know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really i ammature and they are. but we were both really young and we sti will are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age. tl dr my girlfriend is going to ki will herself and wants me to be with her ti will the end. i am conflicted on what to do.	moderate
i need to take this off my chest or i fear the guilt is going to eat me alive this is a long story but i wi will summarize it at my best. i grew up with my mother. i stopped seeing my father reguarly at . he was not a good parent either way, it is like he missed emotions or could not show them, and in the last year i went from seeing hi am as a stranger to someone i actually hate because of the way he reacted after i came out. i can sti will recall hi am i amplying there is something perverted in me. my mother is not that good either, despire being supportive of this, she was never uplifting in my childhood, rarely i was given support when i made errors, rather she would get mad and tell me often things were my fault. i was legit scared of her and felt like i had to walk on eggshells, because i knew she could snap for things as little as what hour is it? . i do not have many memories of my childhood, i forgot most of what happened and therefore it is hard to tell how my parents were when i was a child, however i can sti will feel the effects on my mind. to this day, everyti ame someone is mad, even if not at me, in the same room as me, and the slightly raise their voice or become irritated, i can not help but start panicking and shake. but in the end, except for my difficulty relationing to people and my fear of i amminent abandonment and speaking up for myself, i never had severe problems. i saw the first sign of something getting worst after i got dumped by my ex in november . it was quick and unexpected, but i foresaw it, panicking the day before, fearing he would leave despite having no proof. it turned out my paranoia was right. i quickly forgot about hi am our relationship was long thistance and lasted only month and a half and started dating a friend is friend, and he is really someone i want in my life he is kind hearted, creative, outgoing, funny, protective and ready to help with my mental i willnesses. a human dog basically, and when i lay next to hi am or on his chest i feel a feeling of peace and happiness i hardly ever felt, but there is flaws too, and that is he is interested in open relationships where i am extremely monogamous. he made it clear that he thinks that consent is the most i amportant thing and he wouldn t force anyone in an open relationship, however, because of the fact that we are sti will dating he sti will talks to people online to roleplay sexual scenarios. this worries me more than it hurts, as i fear of losing hi am to someone else who might be better. my friends who have knew hi am for years reassure me he is really into me and he hi amself told me he is not romantically interested in anyone else, and that sex and love are separated to hi am, but i can not stop feeling like i am not good enough and i can be replaced any ti ame. i know i have an obsessive and co dependant type of love and once i find someone i really like i do not want to let go and i feel like i am dying without that person. this is just the tip of the iceberg however. both me and hi am are very sexual people, but i have a very unhealthy view of sex i have a very typical high male libido and i masturbate daily only to keep it down, but to do it i have to thistract myself. if being scared of being touched because i am extremely thisgusted by my body was not enough, i have to redirect my sexual fantasies to pleasing others, because, if i think about pleasing myself too, i wi will feel a terrible sense of guilt and shame from it that wi will break me in tears. i can not help but feel like i am not supposed to have sexual feelings, and that they make me dirty and perverted, that it is wrong and i must feel ashamed of it and hide them. i also have constant fanstasies about being in a relationship where i get beaten, pushed and yelled at to the point my mind breaks and i ki will myself, or i straight up get beaten to death. when i talk about it people assume it is some masochistic fantasy, however i derive zero pleasure from it, only pain. i can not i amagine myself being happy and loved because i feel like i do not deserve it and that there is something wrong with me that makes me unlovable. i also fantasize about being violently raped, or to have sex when i do not want to just to please my partner without hi am knowing. another one is being mistreated during sex, not to feel pleasure, but as punishment for being dirty and thisgusting by having sex. i also started feeling suspicious of everyone after my breakup. i feel like i can not trust anyone friends included, not only romantic partners and that they are all after me, wanting to hurt me, use me, and that i somehow deserve it because i am bad and unpure . this is ki willing me, and i can not tell all of this to the guy i am dating because i feel like a burden, but it sti will makes me feel like i do not deserve hi am, or his affection. when i am with hi am i forget everything and everyone, but the moment after he leaves i feel all the bad feelings back at it again, and i feel like i have to run away or he, or someone else, is too going to hurt me. someti ames all i can think about is cutting my wrists or throat open or banging my head against the wall or table to death. i fear of cutting myself too because if he sees it he wi will feel sad for me and i do not want to put stress over hi am. despite hi am being so, soo patient as a person, i sti will feel like everything might make hi am mad and make hi am leave me, or that if i say the wrong word when he is angry at someone he wi will snap at me. i am extremely in love with hi am, but all this pain makes me feel like i should drop off because i wi will just become a burden on hi am, and that in the future he wi will just be with me because he feels pity for me not being able to go on alone due to depression, and that i wi will end up alone. i just need to take this weight off my chest because i can not bear it anymore. thank you for anyone who has came so far.	moderate
extreme repulsion when people cares or shows me affection i have no idea what is wrong with me. i desire the love of people, i desire affection or understanding, but when it happens i feel so gross. i never been a person that likes physical affection i like the idea of it. i think i have idolized the concept of family, romantic love or friendship in my fantasies all those things feel right. but in reality i just can not handle it. i been telling to myself that one day i wi will find what i am looking for. i wi will know when i see it... the place where i belong, people that i can connect to. it is all lies, is not? i feel like an outsider, i know i should not been here, this world is wrong. i can not love my family, friends, anyone. the repulsion is too strong. i want to end my existence. but i am a coward. unless a gun falls of the sky to my hands... i guess i wi will have to suffer. maybe this is karma... i have to accept my destiny.	moderate
i held a knife to my wrist today i held a knife to my wrist this morning. i was journaling and all the thoughts got to be too much to bare. so i thought physical pain would cancel out the emotional pain. i did not move my wrist or the knife, i just held it there for minutes working up the courage to do it. not to ki will myself but for a release. does anyone else do this?	moderate
i just told mom that i think i may have adhd her response to that was to look at me weirdly and then completely ignore me... i asked what is wrong and she was like idk, you and you re weird stupid ideas .. like who would have adhd i respond people who have trouble paying attention nah, you just need to go out more! then i remembered that this was the same mom i told her i feel suicidal and said if you wanted to ki will yourself, you would have done it already . i am a fucking idiot for talking to her in the first place, like what was i expecting.	moderate
self care made me lose my best friend i usually let people walk all over me but about months ago i was feeling brave. i decided to stop being a pushover and actually try to care about myself and my mental stability. my best friend and i, or i guess i should say ex best friend now, had plans and for about the hundredth ti ame she pushed me aside for some dick and a couple bucks. she even made me be third wheel on my birthday. so i called her out on it and we have not talked since. i wish i never had the courage to stand up for myself. now she is out partying with some new people and i am home alone feeling worthless and abandoned and it is my own fault. i really thought our friendship was strong enough to withstand a little fight about boys but i was wrong. i guess being someones bestfriend for years means nothing. being there for them when they were going through the foster system means nothing. being welcomed in by my entire family as if she was one of us means nothing. even the family members that do not like me love her and ask about her constantly. i wish i could go back to that moment... i wish i had kept my mouth shut... even though she is an asshole i wish i sti will had my best friend... i miss her 	moderate
so tired i wake up exhausted every day. i have to fight myself to get out of bed in the morning or afternoon or evening . i go to school and fight to stay awake in class. someti ames i lose. i get told that it is just me being a teenager, that i need to get more sleep, etc. i can go to bed at pm, wake up at am that is like hours, right? and sti will feel exhausted. on weekends, i wi will sleep for hours straight or more . i have tried changing how much sleep i get, since i have heard oversleeping can make you tired. i tried to get hours a night, no more. then i tried . then . then i said fuck it and went back to that normal hours on school nights. i have grown tired of dealing with entire classes of people. i sit upstairs in the guidance office, just outside my therapist is office, in case i can not handle the other kids in there at a ti ame. i am falling behind in my work. i have assignments due last wednesday that i have not even started. the end of the quarter is this thursday. i have got a pile of work sitting on my kitchen table. i wi will take out a paper, stare at it, try to think about what the questions are asking, and fall asleep. i can not focus. writing this post is the most work i have done in weeks. i woke up a bit over an hour ago. i am sti will tired. i have hardly moved. i have no desire to get up and take care of myself. i faked being asleep as i listened to my mom talk about how she wishes she were dead, how she deserves all the suffering she experiences, how get kids are ungrateful, how i would rather sleep my day away than lift a finger to do anything productive, how my older sister would rather be out with her friends than spend ti ame with her family, how my little sister better be normal and not have anything mentally wrong with her, that my dad should just cheat again already so she wi will have a reason to leave. sorry mom, that my big sister suffers with depression and use to self harm. sorry that i have attempted suicide more ti ames than you ll ever know. sorry that you rely on my younger sister as your last hope. sorry that you decided to marry an asshole after he cheated on you while you were pregnant. sorry that your husband cares more about his alcohol and his video games than he does about any of us. sorry that we re such a burden on you. people tell me i can not be depressed, i am only , i do not have anxiety, i am just nervous, i do not have ocd because my rooms messy, i do not have ptsd, that is only for people who have been to war. bullshit. how else can i explain the suicidal thoughts always on my mind? how else can i explain the lack of motivation to do anything other than sleep? the panic attacks? the urge to touch the desk the same way with each arm? the desire to only use certain numbers when doing miscellaneous tasks? the flashbacks i am bombarded with every day? how can you argue with a professional is diagnosis? how can you know more about me and how my mind works than i do? i am tired of trying to get better. i have been trying to be happy for almost years now. there have been a few ups where i am happy for a day, a week, once almost an entire month. it always comes crashing down. i am on the verge of giving up. i am on the verge of abandoning this life. i am on the verge of tears all the ti ame. on the verge of another breakdown every day. it feels like i am sitting on the edge of the world and looking down into darkness. i look behind me, and i see a world full of nothing but pain, suffering, and sorrow. i look up to the sky and see clouds blocking out the light of the stars. i look back down and i wonder if i should jump, just to see what the darkness holds. i am just so tired of everything at this point. i am tired of my friends. i am tired of my family. i am tired of school. i am tired of life.	moderate

dating with depression hi, i am just looking for some advice at the moment. i am currently dealing with an embarrassing skin condition on my face which should be gone hopefully within a couple months, have been dealing with it for over a year. the condition was that i had a severe reaction to a moisturiser product that caused a lot of bad dermatitis. however obviously this caused me to get into a bad depression and i am not really confident at the moment. however there are a couple girls who have shown interest in me and i was wondering how do i approach this situation as i do also like them but do not think i would be able to be a good partner until this condition fully resolves which should be in another months ti ame. thanks	moderate
things just keep getting worse my therapy office is not open over the weekends. i wish i could talk to them today but i can not so i figured coming here might help. i hate everything about myself. it is not irrational hate either its pure and real and justified. i am ugly, small and mediocre at everything i try, even when putting in maxi amum effort and applying myself over a long period of ti ame. i have no voice and even if i did i have nothing to say anymore. i do not enjoy anything. the only thing that makes me feel anything is my sexuality and i hate that too. i feel it all the ti ame. i am gay and very submissive and it makes me feel weak. i want to be strong but it seems like i am incapable of being that. i do not want to continue on like this and i am tired of trying.	moderate

i fucking hate this someti ames i think about all the pain and suffering that people in the world experience and get sad over it because getting sad is the least i can do to balance out the suffering in this world. today i thought about the young girls in china who get sold as prostitutes because their gender is considered worthless and then they get raped constantly and they can not escape because they are controlled by a huge underground power that probably bought the police force. nobody knows about them, nobody cares, nobody is helping them. i am so thisappointed in society. i can not help them. i didnt even try to. i am just as bad as the others. i feel so so so sorry for them and i hate myself so much. i keep thinking about it and getting myself sad. i am truly, truly thisappointed in everyone around me. theyre all so arrogant and oblivious, while there are extremely vulnerable people experiencing the kind of pain that they can not even i amagine. in the same city, country, continent, and world. i can not believe it. i can not believe nobody cares. this really makes me lose hope. i hate myself and everyone around me. i hate this world. i want to die its am and i wanted to say something like this. this is the first ti ame i am on this subreddit. i am honestly expecting nothing from it. its ok because i am so selfish and its so pathetic asking for help for your own trivial problems when you are refusing to help other people in the world who need your help	moderate

starvation, humiliation and abuse... can anyone relate to being neglected as a child? for me, this one of the core bricks of my depression, and the ghosts that follow me every day... me and my sister were raised in a chaotic household, without the money needed to take care of two children. my dad in particular could become extremely angry over anything. he was and sti will is an alcoholic, and spend tremendous amounts of money on cigarettes and booze instead of feeding us. i often found myself hiding behind curtains and other places, eating one dollar baguettes or anything i could find. he and his parents my grandparents where quick to defend hi am at any cost. constant warfare between the two sides of my family made me chose sides, and who to align myself with in the next shitstorm of family drama. i was and sti will am extremely loyal, and wi will do anything someone tells me just to avoid trouble. as i said my mom and my dad did not get along and often fought over who should have have us the most, and this often resulted in things becoming very heated, my dad would often chase me on the way home to my mom, just because he was bitter over the fact that i went to my mom more than hi am. i know he did track where i walked because we often conveniently meet me in ally ways, and different places of the town where he never drove or would have any reason to drive to, hi used this convenience to drive me back to his place without my say . one ti ame he and my grandparents almost rammed my sister and my mom off the road, in an argument over a party she had been to or something, when they lost them they went back home where i was gaming minecraft and started to whale on me instead, saying that i was on their side and we where thisgusting people and so forth..... honestly i do not remember much as it was this episode that left me with possible ptsd, as one doctor has said to me, but its not confirmed so.... i often prayed to god to ki will me at the age of eight, as i was mentally exhausted. the police became involved several ti ames, but nothing came of it as my dad is a master manipulator and always manages to get out of those situations, like this one ti ame where he flirted with one of the inspectors of child protective services. bulling is also something that has stuck with me, the humiliation of public bulling in school is the one of the worst things i have ever experienced. i can take a beating, and having been kicked by my class mates to unconsciousness, i can say that humiliation is worse. standing in front of the class and having people laugh at you, leaves a sense of shame that you can not get rid off. i moved from home about half year ago and started my higher education, but all of my experiences has left me a anxious wreck, if for example someone touches me without me knowing, something like a pat on the back or a loud noise. wi will trigger many kinds of reactions a out fear, and if i become stressed out i often get a panic attack. this just starches the surface of what i have experienced, with abusive relationships and more, hopefully you guys can relate, i have not really had many friends at all so have not been able to compare my childhood wit anyone else, wonder if i am over reacting or not. i just needed to write some off this out, since i have been holding it in for so long and that strategy has not helped me so far. sorry for bad grammar, english not my native language.	moderate
my parents refused to help prepare me for life and then kicked me out three years ago they did not teach me how to drive, they demanded i got a job in high school but refused to provide transportation, and then my step dad kicked me out literally the day after i graduated because i did not let my dog outside fast enough, so now fast forward three years and i feel completely stuck. i live with my friend is mom, i sti will do not have a car and can not drive, though i have my permit. i make dollars an hour but apparently it takes dollars . in my county to make a living wage. i have to move out by the end of the summer, i need to get a car in a couple of months, and i need to get a car. i am living paycheck to paycheck rn and uber eats all of my money for work. i do not know how i am going to ever be able to afford to live even with three or four roommates because somehow i struggle to meet ends meet with my only bi will being dollars a month for rent. am i just a total loser? how in the actual fuck do people get on their own two feet? i can not afford therapy either and i can not afford medication or health insurance. they refuse to have anything to do with me now and would not help me in ways that matter. ex rn i need to do my fafsa but my step dad is insisting that if i even get dollars , for the next two years he wi will have to end up paying dollars , for the rest of his life but then he said if i can get a therapist then he wi will drive me there. and now they think that they are doing more than enough to help. they live minutes away from me but i see them maybe once every other year because they blatantly refuse to have anything to do with me unless they need me for something. idk what to fucking do. i feel lost and stuck.	moderate
i think i have depression my family does not have the money to get me diagnosed and i do not know if i am just trying to seek attention subconsciously by making myself sad. i am so sad someti ames. it takes over me and it is difficult. i also kind of feel like i would be obnoxious to ask for psychological help, to talk about my own problems when other people around the world are actually dying and suffering. i also do not want to open up and make myself vulnerable. ever. but i am just so sad and i do not know what to do about it	moderate

for anyone in need of a friend just want to leave a post here, for anyone in need of someone to just talk to. in my life, i am lucky to have a couple of friends who i am actually close with and can say i love. unfortunately, my depression is at the point where i basically can not forge a relationship of any kind with anybody who is not going though some shit. depression makes me feel like a different species than the rest of society, because it is the only thing i ever think about. so for anyone reading who is as sad and anxious and skeptic and tired all the ti ame as i am my name is kevin, and the only type of person i am interested in getting to know anymore is you. what brings you here?	moderate
you re never alone... or are you? i never knew i struggled with depression until now. ever since middle school, i was always so happy and upbeat. yet in my last year of middle school, i realized that i was sadder than usually. the beginning of high school was rough and i got through it, but not really? my best friends tell me i am not alone. that i can call them or text them when i needed them. but, i sti will feel alone. i sti will feel like i am trapped in a freaking box, no where to go out. all the air i breath in is negative wit ly the occasional hole being punctured to give me so happiness. i have this friend. who says he is my best friend. but somehow i feel like he is not. we hang at ti ames at school. but i feels like he is ignoring me, that he does not care even though i know he does. he only goes to me when i am upset and does not even hang during a certain free period. it just causes me so much anxiety.	moderate
how bad is bad enough? hi this is my first ti ame writing here, so i am sorry if there is something wrong. i would like to say that i wi will mention suicide too nothing explicit!! , so if this triggers you, please, do not read. i have been feeling like this for so, so long that i do not even know when i am okay and when i am not. i feel that everyti ame i am just feeling anxious, depressed, lost and confused between all of the sensations and interactions or just very very numb. some days i can not even feel my own body i feel pressure, but not the sensation of touch , and sincerely, i do not know what it is, but it is kind of comforting. i do not like being here, i do not like feeling empty like this every ti ame, so being here, but not feeling like, someti ames it is better than the other options for me. someti ames i feel really suicidal. i would not talk about it in details because it is against the rules here and because i really do not want to thrigger anyone if someone reads this. but someti ames it is just an ideia, a wish, and someti ames feels like the only way to stop feeling like this. and the problem is that even if i am not feeling suicidal, i sti will feel bad. some days more, other less, but it is here. it is always here. and i do not know if i should ask for help. i do not think that i can be helped, because there is not something making me feel like this, this is just how i am, and i do not want to make anyone worry about me or lose their ti ame with me. and also, i do not know if it is worth it asking for help. i mean, i have felt so much worse, i have been so close to worst situations, and i did not ask for help at the ti ame. why should i ask now? why should i bother others if i have handled worst ti ames by myself? how bad is bad enough? if i am not going to ki will myself, should i ask for help? i do not want to bother anyone, but someti ames i am just so tired and everything hurst so, so much. i do not want to hurt other people, i do not want to make them deal with my pain, because i know that they have theirs too. i think this is part of why i am posting here. anyone has to answer, anyone has to deal with me. but it is so bad, i just want to take it out of my mind. i am just tired of feeling this pain of being myself and this void that seems to never let me go. i am tired of feeling depressed in silence, because it hurts to seem okay all the ti ame, and i am scared to tell anyone. i am sorry if you read until here. this was just me talking about being tired, and not wanting to tell others about it, so i am sorry.	moderate
i am thinking about locking myself in the bathroom and slitting my wrists. ever since i withdrew from college after doing poorly for the last year and a half and lying about it to my parents, my life has been going down the shitter. i live with my dad and stepmom in the middle of nowhere in maryland, where the closest apartments to my work are , dollars a month, and the cheapest apartments i would need at least two jobs to afford to rent. i suggested to my parents that i would move out by mid april, not knowing how hard the search would be. my parents are supportive, but i can tell that their love for me is waning after how i have behaved with them. they are often cold towards me, not even saying hello. even if i told them what i was going through mentally, they would call me lazy and tell me to get over it. the only thing that is keeping me from ending it all are my outstanding student loans that would take years for me to pay off, and that i have no desire to leave my parents to pay it off as that would be adding insult to grievous injury. i am running out of options.	moderate
possibly unpopular opinion do not get a kitten if you have depression! it can trigger you real bad. i thought getting a kitten to keep me company and be my little best friend would be an amazing idea to battle depression. it was not. most ti ames it is great, but others, the kitten acts very weirdly, not to say aggressive and in many ways it feels he does not like you and wants to keep some manner of thistance or personal space. because cats are very independent, and especially young kittens are quite active, playful and do not dig being hugged and cuddled that much instead of being left free to run around, someti ames you just want to show the little guy some affection and then he bites your hand and runs away, sits as far away as possible from you and if you try to interact with hi am by talk in any way, he swishes his tail really strong like he is absolutely pissed with you. it hurts quite bad to show affection and love to this little cute creature and in return get these responses someti ames. note that they are not always like this, but these situations do happen and they can make your depression worse. in the end, i gave my kitten to a shelter, because the recurrence of this situation was driving me insane and extremely unhappy. you give love, a roof, warmth, food and fresh water to this new friend that you truly love and try your best to pet and cuddle, and these sudden bursts of hey, i fucking hate you, leave me alone for some ti ame please inside your very house can be truly bad. this whole episode made me a worse mess than i previously was, because regardless of those incidents i was attached to the kitten and now i have to deal with the feeling even an ani amal despised me and i had to give hi am away. i am not saying my situation is universal and everyone wi will have the same experience, but please be aware that a kitten might show some behaviors that hurt your feelings real good if you have depression.	moderate

recovery??? hi, hello, first ti ame in reddit. hello! some profanity and some references to sex ahead plus depression and suicide and suicidal ideation , so i am tagging this nsfw i guess? so, i am having a bit of a think here about my current situation and honestly, this issue is not a bad problem to have. as in, i feel bad that this is something i am complaining about, here of all places, but i am feeling kinda lost. a lot lost. i do not know if i need some advice or just to put this in writing so i can look at it in the form of words rather than manic anxiety and internal screaming. i suspect this is going to be really f g long, so very sorry about that. hope some of you stick with me to the end. ok so context i have a few mental health issues, most notably big ti ame depression which has an organic cause. that means it does not necessarily originate from any life event, and instead is an inescapable, life long and not very treatable condition that results from my brain being wired like shit. over the past years or so i am i have been steadily isolating myself and i never really learned how to form like personal connections beyond the shallowest kind and those were mostly by proxy. friends of friends, stuff like that . i did try to ki will myself at one point, a few years ago, when i was at a specially low point. and it turns out i am really bad at suicide, which is probably the only reason i have not tried again yet because if you try and fail to ki will yourself there is a lot of drama and it is exhausting. and honestly i do not have the energy to try and make a life i am content with, it just sounds too... too much. and since then, well... i would mostly accepted that being alive was not something that i liked very much. i derive d very little pleasure from anything, endlessly tortured myself psychologically because when i felt bad at least i felt something, and did not have much of an interest in completing my education, finding a job, moving out of my parents home... y know, just generally having a life. i had sort of accepted, in a truly chi will way, that i was merely existing between depressive episodes and that the next one very well could be the one to push me over the edge, so why bother? i was going to die, and honestly it was going to be soon, and there were means and there was planning. most of the ti ame, going through life without an escape plan by which i mean suicide was si amply i ampossible. like, i probably wouldn t have lived to see august. i was considering my birthday, which on the one hand has the very nifty way of reducing peak grief days for my family and stuff, but on the other hand commiting suicide on your th birthday is just like ugh. and then, like a month ago, it just fucking went away. like, i am not fine fine, but for the first ti ame since i can remember i am in a genuine, sort of stable good mood. i have energy, i am making some some good choices, i want to surround myself with people. for the first ti ame in my life i am thinking that maybe it would be nice to have a job, one that pays just well enough to move out and live with roomates or something. learn how to deal with people, because currently i just do not know how to people, and perhaps one day have a romantic relationship. or several! i am not going to lie, i did not exactly welcome this change. i do not know where it came from i wi will get there sorry this is so long , or what to do with all that energy, or what i am feeling most of the ti ame because i have no context for any of this emotions. and a little later i just started to be terrified, all of the ti ame, that one day it is going to go away and never come back. i am sti will terrified and confused and all that, but somehow it does not detract from my good mood because now i am a positive person i guess. thisgusting. okay, that was context, so sorry for the rant. here comes another one. so around the ti ame this started, i was starting to hang out a bit more often with some friends of friends, always as a group. i like them very much, and i knew one of them beforehand. he is really nice and the kind of person i would really like to hang out one on one which we have, once, i think if i knew how to like bond with people and talk to them just because, and if one on one weren t such a terrifying thing. kind of a mess, he is, but like in a someti ames endearing way. a bit sitcomy i guess. and while i honestly do not know because i do not know anything anymore , i am starting to fear that i might have a bit of a crush on hi am, which would be all around terrible for several reasons. first, feelings? gross. i have rarely liked a guy. hell, i have not ever kissed a boy i had feelings for. i have kissed many, fucked even more rarely good, rarely worth it, always punishing , but never one i actually wanted to kiss. i do not know if i know how to do that. second, i am happy but i am not an idiot. if this is actually a crush, nothing good is ever going to come out of it. no way no how. third, ti aming. i was going to die, by my hand, soon, and now i have a new lease on life. can you i amagine that my sudden change is because i like a boy? it would be so sad, and really dangerous, and again so very sad. and i am fine now, but what if i start wallowing about it? i can not afford that. so i have come to the conclusion that me having a crush on this dude is really gross. potentially lethal for me . ugh. and like i said, i truly do not think i am in denial. i honestly do not know and i have come as i write this to the very reasonable conclusion that the answer better be no . and i can not tell, i really can not tell. yes, i feel sort of funky when i hear about his relationships and crushes and romantic connections, but honestly that does not tell me much because i have always felt bad when hearing about blossoming new romances and shit, because it brings out many of my own insecurities. i guess this is it? oh, man. tl dr i have depression, anxiety and a few other stuff going on, i do not really have the energy or motivation to try to do anything about that, was planning to ki will myself soon and then one day out of the blue i felt a lot better. did not like it, did not understand it, live in fear it is going to go away and never come back, now i do not understand my own emotions most of the ti ame. because of ti aming i am afraid i might possibly have a crush and that is why i feel better, because that would suck real bad.	moderate
overthinking... i am m but i am always told i am mature for my age. i have been sort of talking with this girl recently over text and seeing her fairly often and it is been flirty and forward. we have kissed but nothing more. however last night i was at a party and went back to a friends hosue afterwards with a few other people. there were guys and girls including me and so as teenagers normally would, we sort of paired up and each sat next to one of the girls. about minutes into the film she put my arm around her and she started to lean on me, which i took as a sign that she felt comfortable. this girl is beautiful, not standard beauty. messier hair, baggy jumper and tracksuit but something about it was beautiful. as the movie progressed we got more and more inti amate unti will we were spooning or whatever. we made out and that is it. it is gotten to the point where i have spent all day thinking about it. for example i play football every sunday and normally it takes my mind of things, like whenever a wave of depression hits me i have been diagnosed with bipolar thisorder and i go onto a football pitch everything brightens up within my head and i feel light and free, but this morning i really really did not. i felt weighed down and burdened by it all. i really really enjoy spending ti ame with the girl i am kind of seeing at the moment and we always have a laugh and it is always fun. but the girl i hooked up with last night makes me fight a smile every ti ame i hear her name or think of her. i can not stop thinking about what i should do and whether it meant more to me than it did to her. i can not stop thinking about how i can find that out or what my next move should be. it is all so grey at the moment. there is a massive weight on my shoulders but i can not get it off. i feel like i am drowning in my own thoughts and that i can not breath properly.	moderate
so i have started having suicidal thoughts. they only started about a week ago. i have always had the idea in my head but i do not think i was ever serious about it. it feels different now though. like i might actually. i am not to the point where i am going to yet, more in the sense if i had a gun right now there is like a i would fucking end it on the spot.	moderate
shit days like these. i had a terrible day yesterday. so much bad shit happened. how do i move forward? with ti ame? with doing something i love? i feel so tired and just done with all this bs. i fucking hate it. i am trying to watch tv and shows and videos that used to make me smile and laugh but i feel nothing, i feel compeltely fucking empty.	moderate
i have felt so bad lately and i really need some help this is my first ti ame posting here and i think i need some advice or something. so for some backstory my childhood was not the greatest. i have been a huge fan of games and movies since i was a little child and yeah i usually got what i wanted but that is not the point here. when i was or years old my mother met her new man and they started dating and so on. soon after they started to date he was all over me not like in sexual manner but he used to hit me and keep my head underwater and lock me in sauna and even kept me from eating someti ames. and he always did these things when i did something that he thought was wrong like not cleaning up my room, being late or if i did not do any homeworks. and he even did it in front of my mom someti ames and she did nothing to prevent it they even had a kid and got married. of course when my step brother was born i got blame for every little mistake that i made and if my brother fell over then i got the blame and i was hit by my stepfather. only one who believed me when i told about this was my dad is aunt who was my best friend and who always had my back but she was really old like but she was everything to me back then because i did not have any friends and i have always been that lonely kid. when i grew up my dad is aunt died and soon after my grandmother and those two were really i amportant to me and i did not even cry when they died because all that i felt was deep emptiness that i sti will feel to this day even though i do not want to admit it. it left a deep void in me that i have tried to fi will up for years and someti ames it has worked and i have felt happy but soon after it has only gone downhi will. after my real first relationship in th grade ended when she cheated on me and went with another one and soon after that i have always felt really not so good about myself and i even thought about ki willing myself because life just felt so worthless but then came this another girl who first understood me and tried to help me and she did for a while and so we ended up talking for many months before we started to date and that was the worst relationship that i had ever had because it involved a lot of arguments and she blamed me about everything and i reacted the wrong way and i cheated on her and it left me with so much guilt that after few months it told her about it and i wanted to break up and so after that i avoided relationships and pretty much any human contact for months until a new girl came into my life and we dated for few months and we broke up because i was a real mess and after few months we decided to try again and everything was going on really good until my mental issues surfaced and they pretty much messed up everything. well few months i was diagnosed with depression and ocd and i someti ames i get these intrusive thoughts that makes me question everything in my life but mostly it focuses on my relationship. like those thoughts range from you do not feel for her anymore , you do not love her anymore to just end this relationship and it makes me question that do i have feelings for her sti will. someti ames i get this feeling of deep emptiness and someti ames it comes when i am alone and when i am with her and it scares the hell out of me. like i want to enjoy my life with her but my mind struggles so hard to make me feel like that i do not want to be with her anymore and someti ames it feels so real that i even start to believe it. i have told her about these and she has promised to help me in anyway that she can so she is very understanding. this is also concerning to me because we have not had any problems in our relationship and soon we have dated for a year. she was my ex before but we broke up because i was acting like an asshole and she sti will had feelings towards her ex so we broke up but then i did not know about it even though i asked her many ti ames. and when we got back together she did not tell me about it and i had to find out myself and i felt really bad because she lied to me back then but now everything has been fine in our relationship and we have both worked on those old issues and are no longer keeping secrets but i can not find out why i feel like this. like is this because of my mental problems or is this relationship genuinely not good? someti ames i feel like ending everything would be a good choice because then i wouldn t have to feel anything anymore and just be gone from everyones life.	moderate
what a horrible thing for a psychiatrist to say to someone with depression i have terrible grammar but i wi will try to express this the best i can. i have always had a difficult ti ame in school, it is like i lack the ability to study. i can read the same paragraph ti ames and sti will have no clue what i just read. in the late s and my late s , i finally got fed up and spoke to my doctor for advise. he referred me to a psychiatrist and when i sat with her, i explained how much i want to go back to school to better myself but lack the tools to learn. i told her i contacted a learning center but just the consultation would cost me nearly dollars , i could never i amagine having that kind of money. after explaining all of this to the psychiatrist, she told me i should just accept the person i am and that and i quote higher learning is not for everyone and to stop wasting ti ame or money as this is all i wi will ever be. i felt so heart broken and lost and here we are, years later, i am sti will holding on to this. i completely gave up believing what parents and teachers always told us, you can do whatever you put your mind to . i became angry at my parents, why mislead people telling them you can do whatever you put your mind to when an expert basically told me not to thrive for something more.....but i have this feeling deep inside of me that i can not explain...i just want to scream so loud. i have such a strong desire to be more, to do more with my life. i hate my job so much, i am so frikkin bored at work all day but i feel like this is all i wi will ever be good at. one of my closest friends is trying to get me a job interview with her company and she truly believes i wi will excel at it but i am being self destructive and it is like i am trying to get her to change her mind and forget about the referral. i tell myself she is just being nice, i wi will embarrass her, i wi will fail, they wi will let me go within a couple months and then i wi will be completely out of a job. i really do want this job, it is been such a long ti ame since i have desired something this bad but anxiety and depression keeps getting in the way. holy crap this is difficult getting this out, i am shaking and eyes are fi willed with tears. i have never expressed myself to strangers like this before and feel ashamed.	moderate
i lost the love of my life. now life is pretty much over! i have been separated from my wife for the past two month, we have been together for years. married for . we have amazing children together. i admit i have not been the best husband or dad. i have taken them all for granted. i should have realised that i was being an arsehole a lot sooner. i spent too much ti ame working rather than spending ti ame with my beautiful family. used to come in late from work and just fall asleep and not have ti ame for anyone. my wife and i used to argue about loads of different things, like money and bi wills. i was a shit person, i made her feel shit unintentionally. i love her with the whole of my heart. when we separated i had so much ti ame to think about all the shit stuff that i had done. so i made loads of changes, spent less ti ame in the office, started collecting kids from school, taking the kids out for dinner. i have lots loads of weight, because i am working out, i am paying for pt sessions. i genuinely believe i have changed my whole lifestyle to be a better person. unfortunately this was not enough for her. she does not want me back. she said it is a little too late. this is ki willing me so much. all i want is to hug her again. she is the love of my life. i miss her so much! i just want to be able to treat her like she should be treated. i have realised now what i should have been doing. she is not having any of it. now i have major regret. i am in a dark place. i feel worthless. i have been to the doctor, they said that i have severe depression. it is a big dark hole that i feel like i can not get out of. i can not function properly day to day. she told me to tell the kids it is all my fault, she said the kids are not bothered wether i am not there, they do not ask for me etc. the kids are the only positive thing i have let in my life. i do not know what to do anymore. wi will it ever get better? i feel like i do not need to be around anymore. i feel like there is nothing left for me now. constant memories are making me feel shit all day everyday. i think that now she might be seeing someone else. so that means there would be no way for me to go back to the only love of my life. i think it would be best for all that i no longer be around.	moderate

i want a break i really want to take a break. i do not even know what i want to take a break from. i always feel stressed, despite not having anything that is too out of the ordinary in my life. my parents do not understand any of my issues, so i can not talk to them. my social life is normal, i have a small friend circle of about people, and one of them knows my reddit profile. i just can not figure out what it is stressing me out. i have to put on a shell in front of people, because i would not seem very presentable if i act down, even though it is the only thing i do well. i just need a break from something. thanks for reading my vent session.	moderate
pangs of loneliness and purposelessness i had a lot of fun the past two days. it felt really nice to hang out with friends and really just remembering how close of a friends we are. how can it be, that i feel so lonely, purposeless and empty now? out of the blue. lately i have been realizing how much my life wi will change. today, i logged my expenses and income of the past five months. i figured out how big of a student loan i am going to take out. i responded to some dorm listings. studied for a bit. i thought, what if i fail out of my study program? if i do not make any friends and just do nothing all day? am i going to waste my life, that is already insignifican not? i do not know.	moderate
my mom is a sociopath and i can not help but to wonder what my life could have been like if i had normal parents. i grew up with incredibly loving, but strict parents, an amazing older sister, and an older brother with whom i am not close to. my mother and i always had a great relationship as great as it can get hen you are only thiscussing school and leaving out every personal feeling and thought because you know your mom wi will never understand . it was obvious that i was their favorite i was spoiled rotten. my relationship with my dad was loving and nice, but we never really talked. there was no depth. however, it was not like that with my mom. we talked about school and my friends, but i never felt comfortable talking about my personal life with her because she was incredibly judgmental. i kept a lot of things to myself, or i would share them with my sister. she is my best friend, and has always been kind of a second mom to me, something my mother was always jealous of. in all honesty, i, and much of my family members believe my mother has a mental i willness my sister and i have diagnosed her with being a sociopath after a lot of research and reminiscing , however she refuses to acknowledge it. all in all, my life was not perfect, but it was a good life fi willed with family and friends. i met my best friend in th grade, but we did not become true best friends until high school. we were inseparable i was either at her house, or she at mine. we told each other everything, as best friends do. we even had si amilarly strict mothers, so we could relate to each other in that aspect. we always talked about living together when we went off to college, to get an apartment together to have our freedom, but we knew our mothers would never approve. so we planned in secret. as i said, my mother and i had a good relationship. i was always a good child. i was terrified of getting in trouble, and never thisobeyed my parents. it was not until my senior year of high school that i could see our relationship changing for the worse. my mother became even more strict, nosey, and suspicious. i wanted my freedom, and she wanted nothing more than to keep me locked in our house with as little freedom as possible. the last thing she ever wanted was for me to have my own life and leave her and my dad. needless to say, the older i got, the harder it was to live in that house. in , i graduated from high school and began going to a community college in town, where i stayed for one year to start my basics. during this ti ame, living at home was a nightmare. i was and sti will had to ask permission to do anything and everything. i was miserable. meanwhile, my bff and many of my other friends went straight to universities. i was young, i ampatient, and wanted to be like everyone else, so i transferred to the university in my town that next fall. my dad worked there at the ti ame, so i got a huge thiscount on tuition as long as i maintained a certain gpa. as i have said, my mother is crazy and strict. once i was attending, my mother was always in my school business. for some reason, she was under the i ampression that i had to show her my grades daily. she did not understand that college was not high school we do not receive report cards, and my grades were just that my grades. i felt no obligation to show her or anyone else how i was doing in school. in all honesty, i was doing very poorly. i was not adjusting well to college and it showed in my grades. i was never one to thisappoint my parents. i always tried my best in school and made decent grades, so this was all completely new to me. so, when my mom was constantly asking to see my grades and i refused, conflicts arose. living at home was harder than ever. i was trying to grow up and become my own person, while my mother was trying to keep me her baby for as long as she could except she did it in the only way she knew how, which was to pick fights and push me away. we fought constantly about everything. she tried to take away my phone at ti ames, but i paid for my phone bi will so i refused. she went ballistic. refusing to show her my grades set her off. she even wanted to know my login information, which i did not give to her and she hated it. i could not talk to my dad about any of this, because he always sided with my mom, or would just defend her. he never saw her in the same light as my siblings and i did fearful, crazy, unstable, and unpredictable. i was by now, and finishing up my first semester at college. my grades were the worst i have ever had, and i knew my mom would be upset. bff and i had been planning to move out together soon, except neither of us told our parents. i knew the conversation with my mom would not be civil, and bff is mom would just try to talk her out of it. my mom has a history of getting violent, both verbally, mentally, and physically. this is one of the reasons i tried to never thisappoint or anger her. she never laid a finger on me aside from spankings when i was younger , and in my mind i would never let her. i would never put up with abuse as she did to both my siblings. i had seen first hand what she was capable of, and that scared me. so, i came up with the best solution i could think of to protect myself. it was now the end of the semester, and grades were posted. i was ashamed of how terrible i did and i knew my mom would want to see them when she got home. so, i packed a bag and i told my dad i was going out, and left. before getting even a mile down the road my mom called me. she knew something was up call it mother is intuition. i told her that i was leaving, that i could not do it anymore, and that i was sorry. she completely lost her mind, which i expected. in my mind i had two options stay and tell her in person and risk getting hit the risk was a possibility , or do as i did. eventually i got to my destination, a friend is house, and i explained everything. i called my sister and told her everything, and unfortunately put her in the middle of it all. my mom was desperate to get me to come home, so eventually i agreed to meet her at my friends house. before my friend got a chance to tell her mom our plan of moving out, my mom beat her to it and told her everything. this complicated everything more. we met at her house, and i was terrified of seeing my mom. i knew what was coming. sure enough, when i denied going back home, she tried to hit me and shoved me into a bookshelf. i threatened to call the cops, and friends mom asked her to leave. in return she took my car and left me there. everyone was in shock there were no words to describe how we each felt. i eventually called my sister and she came to pick me up and took me home with her. that night was one of the longest of my life. i broke my parent is heart, and they broke mine. that one decision, forever changed my life. my friend and i were sti will in touch to move in together, however it was not for a month or so. for the next few months, i was considered homeless. i stayed with my sister, a friend i met at college, and a coworker from when i worked at walmart. during all this ti ame i only had the bag of stuff i took with me the night i left home. my mom refused to let me get my stuff, and in all honesty, i was terrified to go back and get it. during this ti ame, i met my boyfriend. we were coworkers at walmart, and he invited me to stay with hi am and his roommates during the holidays, which i accepted. we clicked and decided that when i moved into my apartment with my friend, he would move in too and help with the rent. one day, bff and i were finally able to sign for a month lease on a bedroom apartment. the day came when we could finally move in, which my bf and i did. neither of us had many belongings. he came from the dorms at college, and i came with my bag. i kept asking my friend when she was bringing her stuff, so she would bring little things over, like thishes or other i ampersonal items. i began getting the feeling that she was hiding something from me. sure enough, i was right. one day, she texted me and told me how sorry she was, but that she would not be moving in with me and would continue to pay her half of the rent. not only had i lost my relationship with my parents just months before, but i also lost my best friend. i was so upset at her for doing that to me, betraying me, and not even having the nerve to tell me in person but over a text. at this point the only people i had in my life was my sister, and my bf. my life kind of sucked. for the next few years, my mom called me constantly, leaving me ugly voicemails, calling me every name in the book, and completely thisowning me. my dad was hardly aware of the situation, and kept his thistance he never even reached out to me. in addition to thisowning me, my mom also thisowned my sister and her two kids, because she thought my sister helped me plan my moving out. to this day, my mom has never tried to make contact with my sister or her kids. in fact, those kids are terrified of her and hate her because of what she did to my sister and me. my niece, who is know actually has nightmares about my mom. about and a half years ago, my mom let my dad bring me my stuff. it was a truckload of my belongings, half of which she destroyed. i remember going through it with my sister, we pulled out a blanket that smelled like a combination of vomit and urine. i had to throw it out, as well as other items that were crushed or vandalized. i never got all of my stuff back, and i probably never wi will. i had never stepped foot in that house again until last year when i went to visit my dad. my mom was not home so i knew it was safe. we talked outside for a bit, and i asked to go inside. i wanted to see my old room. there were sti will some of my things in the closet and room, like my rock collection. i asked my dad if i could take it with me but he said no, because then my mother would know i was there and he wouldn t want to upset her. i walked around the rest of the house, everything was the same as the last ti ame i was there they even sti will had our pictures up which i thought was ridiculous. all of my old toys from when i was a child were packed away somewhere. my dad said maybe one day i can have them. i hope one day i can, because it stinks not having one thing from my childhood to see or hold, or give to my future kids. it has been about years now since everything happened, and i sti will cry for the relationship i wi will never have with my parents. i cry that i wi will never feel the embrace of my mom or dad again that i wi will never hear them tell me i love you ever again that they wi will never know their future grandchildren or son in law. it hurts me so deeply, but i know that nothing wi will ever be the same. i truly believe that my mom has an i willness, and even if she were to seek out help, i would never be able to talk to her the way i used to again. i envy the people who have amazing parents, who love them unconditionally, the way a parent is supposed to love their child. i question everyday why i was not blessed with parents like that. every ti ame something bad happens in my life, i question if it is my karma for leaving the way i did and if that is what i deserve for hurting my parents. i can not begin to i amagine the pain and hurt i put my mother and father through, but i do not think that is an excuse for their behavior or the way they treated my sister and i. i have spent many days and nights crying for that loss, and i hope that one day i can truly move past this, and be happy the way i once was knew how to be. 	moderate
deciding about my future is so fucking difficult i should chose a university i want to study at and apply there in months. everyone around me knows what he wants to do in the future, they have some hobbys, things they like doing. i do not have such thing. it is just that nothing is enjoyable for me, everyday is suffering, i can not find any motivation even to learn, i am barely passing my year. and now i am supposed to find something i would want to do for the rest of my life and study it for or more years. like, i want to be dead, there is nothing i would want to do, i am so tired of doing things	moderate
i feel like i was born with something wrong with me ever since i was a tiny child, i had horrible behavioral issues. i got expelled from numerous preschools and elementary schools. my behavior amp social ski wills got better around age , but at age depression hit me hard and never stopped. i am now amp i have no ski wills. i have no ability to persevere. i want to be an artist so badly, but i am afraid to draw. i was told all of my life by everyone around me, despite the behavioral issues, that i was destined to be someone amazing. that i was smarter than everyone else, despite my utter inability to complete school work beyond tests. i had potential. and now i have wasted all of that potential. i struggle to complete one single college course at a ti ame. i can not drive. i do not have a job. i live with my parents. i spend of my ti ame doing literally nothing, not even listening to music. i have never accomplished a single thing in my entire life. this depression has gone on for years now. and despite extensive mental health treatment of all kinds, despite being given every opportunity to succeed amp all of the love support i could ever need, for some reason i can not accomplish a single damn thing. and if ive been failing amp chronically self sabotaging since i was years old, i dont see how i could ever change that now.	moderate

my world is falling apart i am so scared. i do not know where to turn. my husband is losing his job, and i am unemployed. we would not be able to pay for food, shelter, or health insurance. we re both diabetic. i am on a very expensive antidepressant. my young son has adhd. we all take meds. i feel like there is no way out for any of us. i do not know how to fix this.	moderate
it is so hard to reach out i have been on and off severely depressed since the fall. i work really hard to manage it and am seeing a new therapist this coming week but the working hard to manage part is so exhausting someti ames or maybe all the ti ame idk. i know isolating myself is not healthy to the point of it being dangerous but it is just so hard to deal with other people. people i am not open about my situation with are exhausting and or irritating to be around. i get so drained by just an hr or two of socializing and a lot of things i would normally love are just out of the question. which makes me sad about being depressed i am also having a hard ti ame with the people that do know what is going on to some extent. i hate dealing with their reactions, even the kind ones. people ask what they can do to help and i just do not have anything to tell them. i wish i did because i know they want to help. i keep canceling and not following up on tentative plans because i just sit around and cry. i dont want anyone to see me like that. or i am anxious and can not properly make decisions about anything. i think an unanswered text means someone hates me etc and then i am so out of sorts i can not handle hanging out when they do answer. i have been friends with people who get severely depressed and while l love and care for them i know first hand how hard it can be to be around them. i feel so guilty that i am now that person to others. i do not want to harm people with how unhappy i am but i am afraid i am which makes me isolate more and i see how this is a negative reinforcing loop. so how do you deal with other people? do you have things you ask them to do for you because it wi will at least make them feel better? how do you respond to, is there anything i can do? how do you deal with not wanting to be a burden but also not completely isolating yourself?	moderate
i never feel good enough i hate looking towards social media for validation. in real life i hate myself. it makes me feel like i am only valued by my likes or when i post good content . i made a short film called rehab at on youtube detailing my experience at the hospital after a suicide attempt and i am fixated on the reception it is getting and nothing else. right now it is the only thing i am clinging to to make me feel good. i truly feel like i have lost all ability to truly connect with people. i am just so fucking done with this. why can not i connect?	moderate
tw drug use, overdose, death last night i got a call from my dad telling me my sister was at the hospital, after she found her fiance dead in their bathtub from an overdose. he had been clean for three years, and was so fucking proud of hi amself. we have no idea how long hes been using again, but when i was doing a sweep of his basement, i found a pipe, needles one loaded and three baggies. i used to use, but ive been clean for months now. i always thought if he could do it so could i. but that is not the point i guess. i told my sister she shouldnt worry about it, i kept an eye on hi am. i checked his arms and legs when he wasnt looking. i talked to hi am atleast once a week. fuck i saw hi am earlier yesterday, and i couldnt fucking tell. i told her repeatedly that he wasnt using, cause i would be able to tell if he had been. i put it on everything that he wasnt using. i went to bat for hi am on a hundred different occasions. hes the closest thing ive ever had to a brother, and because i was so sure of myself i told them not to worry about it. i shouldve been able to see the signs.	moderate
what is depression? the closest i have been to being depressed was two years back when everything in my life was kind of falling apart. i gave myself some alone ti ame and tried to figure things out and went back to normal in around a month. i actually do not look at the lows that we have in life in a negative way, i look at them as an opportunity to learn, to be stronger when i face the same problem again. my friends say i am a very negative person which i think is probably true and that is what i wanted to thiscuss here. even when i feel alright, when i feel happy one thought in my mind never changes and that is life is pointless . i do not think there is a point in living because there is generally only endless pain and a few good moments in between. i would really like if some people would share their thoughts on this	moderate
thinking of whats going to happen if i even recover from my depression in the future almost makes me sick of trying to get better in a hypothetical situation, i do get better and i survive. what next? i had to drop out of school because i was so sick. its been like over years. starting over is almost i ampossible. ive been going up and down for so long that knowing i will be in a state in which i feel ok but theres nothing to do, i will just be depressed again. my hypothetical future seems nothing i want to heal over. whats the point. my therapist always mentioned the joke of how many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb? just , but only if the lightbulb wants to get changed. . like how about this. fuck it. i am the lightbulb and i dont want to be changed anymore. its all so pointless. i am at a dead end. fuck life.	moderate
my oldest son just left so here is some of the back story. years ago i attempted suicide with pi wills and he was the one to find me and call . it was in a middle of a divorce and a loosing battle with depression. i ended up with full custody of my son and from the day forward it was us against the world. he was my son best friend and reason to fight back against depression. a few years ago i quit going to counseling and taking my medication like and idiot and started to slowly slide back into depression. oct my son took off the navel boot camp and i started to fall apart. i have been back on my meds for weeks, started therapy again. he came home on leave for days but left just an hour ago. i am having a really hard ti ame with it, can not stop crying. i know i wi will be fine but it just hurts. i have meditated, talked to my friends and family but nothing is helping. going to go for a jog after this and hopefully it helps.	moderate
i hate weekends. i hate weekends so much. i hate school too. but every weekend is increasingly miserable. i hate constantly looking at my phone to see that nobody is texted me, nobody has asked to hang out, everyone is forgotten my existence. i hate looking at my phone just seeing everything my peers are doing with each other, seeing my friends hang out without me. i hate that i can not bring myself to anything productive at all can not clean my room, do my homework, can not do anything but lay in bed and stare at the clock wishing everything would end. in the end i have no homework done, have done nothing my parents told me to do, havent stepped foot out of the house and barely my room. waiting to go back to school where at least people are forced to talk to me. where at least there is some sort of miserable routine. weekends are hell. i barely eat. i cry and smoke and hurt myself in my dirty room all day just to go to sleep and do it all over again the next day. then go back to school feeling more miserable than the last week just to do it all over again the next weekend. i do not know if i can endure another weekend.	moderate
it feels like everything is going downhi will during these past few months i have had problems with self confidence or that is what i am classifying it as, because i am not sure how i am feeling . my grades have been kinda bad, and soon we re choosing schools based on what we want to study. one day, my friend lashed out on me and commented on my bad grades, and it made me feel like i was stupid. when i studied harder and my grades sti will weren t good, it just became worse. i have also been getting more acne recently, it feels like my friends who i hang out with in class and have known for three years have something against me, and i have noticed that preformance wise, i am not as good as i thought. i do mma, and have been doing it for a couple of years. we recently started sparring for real with others who are as experienced as us, but i am much worse than others who have been training just as long as me. i dont know who to tell this to, because it feels kind of embarrassing, would appreciate a response. thanks	moderate
by focusing on depression, you wi will never conquer it. i think that depressed people are very intelligent and it is a viscous cycle by focusing on the negative. we seem to have this duty to fix anything wrong and when it is too hard to pinpoint we go haywire and it destroys our psyche. just let go. it is hard. i am hard on myself a lot but if i forget about it by a change of scene then i forget but i can go right back and say nothing works. tldr just ki will the cycle by stop dwelling in it. i even think you should stop following this type of r it is going to feed doom into your mind. again just try to break the cycle. smash it into pieces	moderate

angry episode due to depression? hey y all. this is my second long bout of depression. most likely stemming from my dad is death three years ago. it is always there a little, but this whole winter has been really hard. it is difficult to separate what is wrong with me and what is wrong with my marriage lately though. anyway, i started a challenge with my husband to help our marriage a bit. it was supposed to be fun, help us to reconnect, be more open emotionally, etc. the last two days it was like he was not even trying. he never got excited about it. it was super triggering for some reason. i felt alone, rejected, uni amportant, and like i can not trust hi am to do what he says he wi will. i completely lost it. screaming, yelling, crying, punching walls, throwing things. during my first bout of depression i remember doing that a few ti ames but i think it was because i mixed alcohol and antidepressants. i am not on anything this ti ame. maybe i need to be. my question is, is this a symptom of depression? do depressed people have irrational angry outbursts like this? or it is unrelated? i was doing so well and now i am back here.	moderate
do i have depression? what should i do? f i have been feeling very restless since i was , which gradually got worse in the last years. i know that i enjoy studying and i do have many other goals i want to achieve such as exercising regularly , but i can not seem to translate them into actions. i suspect it started due to a burn out. when i was , i did well in my exams and it felt good so i really enjoyed studying. hence, all i did was to study all day. approaching a major exam, i think i started to burn out and i someti ames just laid on my bed and used my phone when i should have been studying. this went out of control when i entered high school. there was a steep learning curve, and everyone around me were smarter than me. studying became less enjoyable, and my tendencies to stay in bed all day doing nothing became stronger than ever. looking back, those were really hard ti ames, my mind was literally telling me to study but my body wouldn t budge an inch. i thought that it would be over after i have finished my exams, but unfortunately not. at first, i tried very hard to get out of this situation. i worked hard to find a job during my break, and started journaling. however, such progress was only short lived. even though i managed to get a temporary job, everyday when i reached home and on weekends, i was one with my bed. now that i have received my results, i am even procrastinating with my uni applications. my parents were very strict and controlled my life for the first years, so i do not think i was given the chance to develop my self thiscipline. i am not sure if i have issues with my self thiscipline or if i have any mental i willnesses. i have many goals for myself, which i have written and typed so many ti ames in an attempt to kick start my momentum, but they never materialise. i am normal at work except maybe a little lack of self confidence , but off work i literally do nothing useful. can someone help me analyse my situation and also provide tips on how i should proceed from here? i would really appreciate any help, thank you!	moderate
just wanted to say hello amp introduce myself. hello beautiful people. i have been diagnosed with moderate depression years ago and was put on medication. years later i moved out from home. i seemed to have recovered by then. so treatment stopped. it was not entirely abrupt, but the weaning off procedure was not medically ideal either, because i rather took matters into my own hand. fast forward i think my depression never fully went away. i have not felt this typical emptiness or soul crushing sadness ever since i stopped treatment, but other symptoms come and go in a span of several weeks or months. the main one being i become lazy , everything costs me enormous amounts of energy. i have not really cleaned my flat for months. the laundry is piling on. i do the absolute mini amum of my responsibilities, someti ames not even that. personal hygiene goes out the window. indifference kicks in.	moderate

 sessions into neurofeedback. should i be seeing i amprovement? i have had the brain mapping done and my therapist thinks it is not so bad. i am a logical, generally happy person but i am crippled with depression and emotional dysregulation. context i was an artist until the stress of a very toxic job and unstable relationship kind of ki willed my self esteem and identity as an artist. all of my dreams to be a business owner, real estate owner, and artist seem out of my reach as a poor person without stability or a safety net and realizing this leaves me with no motivation and actual dread every day. i have been trying to meditate on what to do build up my floral business that people keep encouraging me to do but i can not even afford flowers , paint the paintings i feel thisenchanted with that others love, return to a career if i can get a job that supports me but is ageist and sexist and soul crushing? i can not find an answer and i feel trapped in li ambo and paralysis. if money rent was not an issue things would be a lot different. i make plans as often as possible with friends but outside of that i can barely get myself out of bed. even my bed is not stable as i can not afford my rent. i am working freelance for my bf and he is and paying for nf so i have this rare opportunity to turn it around. context so far nothing though. i have trouble staying awake during the sessions like my brain is broken and i just lose consciousness or go into a haze. i do not feel any reward for modulating my brainwaves. i do not even feel like i can control them. the games do not interest me and trying to keep the bad feedback racecar slowing down, screen fading from happening just frustrates me. i can barely keep my eyes open during any of it. outside, i am sti will feeling maxi amum anxiety and depression. am i doing this wrong? what is happening?	moderate
everyti ame you feel like you have found out the cure, you soon realise you have just scratched the surface. i think depression is something deeper than just feeling down. i am and had a real bad bout of depression when i was and . things have been good since then as i learnt a lot and made things easier for myself. the past few weeks have been great. i finally have a picture of what i want in life. i recently got accepted into a grad school and things in general have been going well but today something just hit me. a familiar feeling. my old acquaintance. ah we meet again. why, it is been so long, how nice of you to visit today. but i did not invite you. oh? you just barged in. well, guess i have to make room for you today. it is almost like i forgot what it really feels like. the way it consumes you. all of you. you become helpless thoughtless beingless. the lump in your throat. the gravity in your stomach. it is such a unique feeling but i did forget about it, at least for a while. once it hit me, i could not help but reminisce about my past. the nostalgia is almost poetic. most of me hates this feeling but there is a part of me that absolutely craves it. this is why i am lead to believe that depression is not something you can completely erase. even if you re okay for a few years, it might creep up on you inadvertently. i guess what i am saying is to not think of it as something you wish you did not have but rather focus on how you can make the most of yourself despite these awful feelings and hope that they go away for a while. i hope that reading this might give you a perspective and help you live the life you deserve. thanks for reading. i am out!	moderate
unrequited all my life, my feelings have been unrequited... and i am crying without feeling anything anymore. does this mean i am already numb? but stil i am crying. i should have known. my roommate, who i have strong feelings for, was desperate to have his car cleaned last saturday. and when i got off from his car, he wiped it after me, the windows and the footstep. i didnt even place my foot there. this sunday, i thought he was sleeping late or not feeling well even. it turns out that he left early. so he has a date. he even bought a hair gel at the supernarket yesterday. so it was a date. his car was not at the parking spot. i feel so foolish and stupid. he even knodded when i said we can reheat the food for lunch. he could have told me. why keep it a secret that your going somewhere. i even cooked for lunch. he may have picked her up and thet went to church together. because he wouldnt have his car washed like that without expecting a girl. this would be a second date. he went to church without me. i am alone now. i wi will not be able to church now, because he already has a new churchmate. god knows i dont have the money to commute. i guess i wi will no longer have days at the mall either. he has a new date to the mall now. i really hope this doesnt work out. ive know hi am and he has thisrespected me in every way that i know. i was only treated as someone he needs to live with out of necessity. i am not even treated as a good friend. he knows my depression and that may have been a mistake. when i get panic attacks he would also meet me head on and say its an ugly trait. that is not a friend. my therapist called hi am evil, manipulative, selfish, and chilthish. i shouldnt have these feelings but what do i do? they say depressed people can sti will love, but that is just wrong. nobody really cares anyway. whoever that girl is, she is stupid to even consider hi am. he is sti will married. separated but sti will married. and yet there is a girl who sti will go out with hi am. talk about being desperate. well i am one of those desperates. i just hate this so much. to be set aside like that. to be not seen. i miss people who treat me better, who treat me as a person. past am and i am sti will crying. i am crying because i know i will forever be alone. i dont have anyone. i am ugly, unloved, and used for. conveniences.	moderate

depression headaches?? hello everyone! ive tried to describe depression headaches all my life but i am not sure if other people get them. people have blamed physical inactivity which ive found not to be true and i only get them at a huge emotional low. its like a tension headache, however i use headache very loosely because its not even painful i amo, although i feel the pressure described in tension headaches. its like my emotions are manifesting physically. or maybe its the feeling of seratonin being forcefully withdrawn from my body lol. i just feel pressure on my head and feel nauseous. i thought it was caffeine withdrawl or dehydration, but while caffeine and water helped, the most part wasnt that. anyone relate? its frustrating b c pain meds dont fix it, as there isnt pain in the literal sense, but its an uncomfortable pressure that just makes me feel worse.	moderate
someti ames it hits hard... i do my best to never to never complain, but thought i would give this a try. i have had this deep depression, lately. a little bit of regret, nostalgia, loneliness, and too much ti ame to think. i retired from the military, last november. as much as i was looking forward to it, i miss it everyday. mainly the comradeship. the knowing that although the day is stressful, it is stressful along side your brothers and sisters. moved to a new place, with just my dog. my kids are adults, but i miss them everyday. and the loneliness. i am pretty sure that takes the cake. the ti ame i spend staring out an apartment window. not much to say, other than my sporadic thoughts. maybe i just needed it off my chest.	moderate
not sure what to do with my life amp x b i currently live in pa have a shitty manual labor job i absolutely hate. i graduated with a . highschool gpa because i can confidently say i never studied or really tried once during highschool. was literally assignments behind a few weeks before graduation and failing most of my classes so i calculated the exact amount of assignments i needed to do bare mini amum to pass in each class and only did the bare mini amum but made sure i aced all the ones i did do by using a little bit of effort. but i am now and regretting not caring at all about highschool and not knowing what to do with my life. i dont know what i would like to do as a job maybe something in law enforcement but i am sti will unclear. everyone in my family is poor and lives paycheck to paycheck i do not want to be like this. i didnt grow up like normal kids so i did not get to experience things a teenager usually does like going to parties having my first drink or even relationships. i was forced to stay home and care for my great grandmother who had alzhei amers since i was taken out of normal school and put in online school so i could be home did not get to leave the house for months at a ti ame except to go and get my haircut every few months. our hallway was always full of dog poop because i didnt care at the ti ame and they weren t my dogs. lived with my aunt too but she was a drunk and gambler. i am just at an i ampasse in my life right now not knowing what to do. the only thing i can say for certain is i want to get out of this godforsaken state and live a little experience the things i missed out on. texas seems nice	moderate
happiness it is funny, because if i really think about it, no probably knows how bad my depression is because i come off as happy almost all of the ti ame. people that dont have depression or know what it is like dont see it, they dont see that even when i am smiling i feel like i am slowly dying inside, or when i make a stupid joke it is my way of coping with the pain. and when they do see it, it comes as such a shock or they label it as something else. you re lazy, get up and do something. god, you can be such a bitch someti ames. have you really not done anything all day? stop overreacting. calm down it is not a big deal. i could go on for days with the little things i hear my family and friends say when my happiness and smile crack, when the facade breaks just a little bit and they are able to see the dark and twisted up person i am inside. i smile and laugh and force myself to slap that smile back on because i know that they can not and they wi will not get it, even if i spelled it out explicitly. i just feel like a clown most days, painting on my face and putting on a show to make everyone else happy.	moderate
i am freaking the fuck out about this i moved back into my moms house about a year ago. since then her cat has fallen i wi will, so i have been paying the the cats vet bi will s. shes going to end up needing a surgery that wi will cost k in a town hours away. my moms house needs around k of repairs done or else we are risking out health living in mold. i dont give shits about my health but i want my mom, and her pest to be healthy. she can not afford any of this so i am obligated to pay for all of it. i personally saved k, and i have about k in my trust fund, and another k in a little while because my brother wi will be buying out my half of the house. i would just use that money to pay for repairs, and such, but my dad, and mom dont get along, so my dad would be livid if i used my trust fund on my mother is house. i know my grand parents wouldnt be happy iether. i know i am probably being a little bitch, but i just needed to vent about this.	moderate
why even bother to do anything that makes you happy? you always feel x worse after it is over. maybe it is because deep down you know the feeling is not coming back for the next three weeks. you go through all this effort, just to feel happy for what? like a day? if that. and then whatever you were happy over ends or you stop liking it like every other interest or hobby that was massacred by the murderer called depression... it seems pointless. people always tell you to go out and find something you enjoy, but when you re depressed, with actual depression, it is not going to last. it never does. why even bother?	moderate
wtf week this week has just been too much. for a bit of context i have attachment and thissociation and really struggle with processing and accepting human emotions. this week i sat on the tube platform to ki will myself. that is my chosen method. this was the closest i have got to actually ending it all. then to make matters worse someone i have been getting to know drunk text their love for me. but i am struggling to process it. i feel like i am spiralling. that this major thing was said and now we re carrying on like nothing was said and i dont know if that is normal. i have been struggling for a while and this week has really seen it all come to a head. i dont think this post makes sense as i am not good at expressing my feelings but i just needed to post something to try to get it all out of my system.	moderate
 thing to live for... yeah... i only have one thing to live for and it is this girl i like. after about a month of realizing that i actually loved this girl she attempted suicide. fortunately it was an attempt and she did not succeed. when she i learnt that she tried to ki will herself my mental state went rock bottom. i thought of every single way possible to ki will myself and wondered who it would affect and that i did not give a shit about it anyways. this has all happened in the ti ame lapse of a week and i needed to write it down somewhere. last thing to note and that is fuck life. 	moderate
lost sense of self i have grown up in a white country, and have always been told my grandfather was spanish which explained why i had brown skin. my girlfriend got me an ancestry kit to thiscover whereabouts in spain my grandfather came from as my mother never spoke of hi am and did not ever want to talk about hi am. i was raised catholic with my grandmother being irish and my grandfather supposedly spanish which made sense. after taking the test and getting my results, it turns out he was indian. i have really struggled to accept who i am as i feel zero connection to asian culture. can anyone help me with any advice on how to accept myself for who i am, as i am extremely depressed and unable to accept myself?	moderate
trying to meet new people makes my depression way, way worse hello, i am a college student. this semester had been going pretty well. i was able to casually chat with people in my classes every now and then which was good. i was enjoying my major, and overall feeling like things were going well. i never really try to make friends with people since it usually just feels like a huge burden on me mentally and emotionally. i have a few friends, which i am grateful for, but i have been thrown down so much. a few weeks ago however i met what i thought was the perfect girl. i was being very cautious at first and just wanted to be friends since we have a lot in common. we were snapping back and forth and she seemed so interested, things were going so well and i was really feeling good. she invited me to come over for a party and to come a few hours before and i did. we chi willed a bit and seemed to get along very well. she then started cuddling on me and we ended up spending the night together. we kept talking more and hung out again, but she suddenly lost interest out of nowhere. i had let myself get too complacent and she made a burrow in my lonely mind. she is so perfect to me. she looks amazing, she is interested in all of the same things as me, if anything i envy her a bit because she actually does the things that i was scared to pursue when i was younger out of fear of ridicule. now i am just another pathetic loser to her, desperately trying to scrape up our relationship. all i ever think about is how much better life feels with her and how bleak it is without. i wake up feeling dread, i can barely focus on anything. it is been like weeks. i know i should just forget about her and move on, but i do not think i wi will ever find another person like this again. i know for the rest of my life i wi will be comparing girls to this one and they wi will never measure up. i do not want to die, because then i would never get to see her again. she makes life feel worth it.	moderate
i am not sad anymore just painfully numb, everything seems so dull and dreary. i wake up in the morning and already start wishing the day would end so i could go back to sleep. i get so bored i start hurting myself to feel something other than just nothing, but i dont feel that either. and despite all that i do not think i have depression or any mental i willness, i used to think so since i was sad the whole ti ame and hated everything and everyone, but now nothings there... i want to go back to those miserable ti ames cause misery seems better than nothing at all	moderate
the circumstances might change, but i would not i just realized that it would not really matter what i do or accomplish if my mentality stays the same. i thought for a while that all i needed was a goal but goal passion. i do not think that i wi will ever be satisfied with what i am doing, i do not think i wi will ever feel like i am doing something that is worth it to somebody. i have not really longed for anything for so long now. the only thing i want is to be alone but when i am alone i get mad at myself for not doing something with my ti ame. it is not going to go anywhere. i do not want people in my life so i can thisappear when i want to because i do not see myself actually going through the stages of adulthood. most of all i do not really know what to do with myself or if i really need to exist.	moderate
been giving in a lot more lately i have been pretty ok with my life. of course not really but recently i have had more and more thoughts of suicide and running away leaving everything even the single most precious person i love. or at least think i love. in a recent little argument we had she called me out on doing bad habits and that i do things she told me she does not like. she said she is tired of me constantly making the same mistakes. i tried explaining to her that my head is too clouded to remember things that are i amportant to me. and she should understand because she suffers from depression aswell and has forgotten our anniversary several ti ames but i never got mad or annoyed at her for that. but when i said i do not want to live anymore and that she should leave me before she gets more depressed over my death she said she thinks i am making my depression up as an excuse to emotionally abuse and manipulate her. i have gone too deep in this relationship to breakup with her. i feel forced to stay or else she wi will do something. but i agreed that we can a poly relationship with someone she fell for in the mental hospital. so now knowing she has someone to be happy with and she seems way happier with hi am than me most the ti ame i feel like i have no worries to cut the ties with everyone i know.	moderate

why does all my worth rely on a single person i literally had such a good weekend. i saw my mates, we watched and played football, and we went out partying. it was fucking great. then literally as soon as there is something wrong in my relationship, it completely sends my world down. it is like if theres a single problem in the relationship, my head just thinks everything is life is shit. as for a bit of backstory i also suffer with really bad anxiety, mainly because she messed me around a bit. either way it is like i am tied kn a fucking loop of trying to please just because if theres something wrong it sends everything to shit sorry about the rant it probably does not make sense but she is just asked for ti ame to herself to decide what she wants. fuck this man.	moderate
the fuck am i supposed to do the fuck am i supposed to do my parents have these little pity arguments that someti ames turn into an all out verbal brawl. i am powerless over my father. i am considered on the spectrum, and with my dad who used to be in a constant state of anger i never felt safe around hi am. he said that he changed, my therapist, mother and everyone else said he changed, yet i do not believe them. just now my father was pissed about something so undoubtedly worthless and yet he sti will persists on being an anger ball of shit. he just called my mom an asshole under his breath and i wanted to ki will hi am right then and there. he reminds me of his old self that everyone says he moved out of. his old self included me being in constant stress and fear that one tiny little thing wi will just set hi am off and get hi am to rant about me being a worthless piece of human shit. everyone keeps telling me to move on, yet no one knows the sinking feeling of maybe, just maybe, the old angry dad wi will show hi amself again. so reddit, what the fuck am i supposed to do?	moderate
i feel like selfish and worthless i want someone to talk to me and listen to my problems. i called my guy friend but ig he is busy. he has a gf so i feel bad if i talk to hi am for too long. he does not really get depression but he is trustworthy. i have not gotten too deep, just told hi am i have depression. i am afraid to talk to hi am about how sad i really am and feel like it would be selfish to put all of this on hi am. i had another guy friend who understood what depression was and such. he helped me last year. we drifted. i tried to reconnect yesterday but i do not really know if our friendship sti will exists. it had gotten complicated with feelings last year. i regret confessing because maybe if i did not we d sti will be friends. i feel like i ruined our friendship but i really need someone to talk to and i have been crying nonstop the past days. i feel selfish because when i talked to hi am we only talked about me and my problems. maybe that is why he does not like me.. i miss hi am so much.	moderate
what is the most memorable thing a partner has done for you during a depressive episode? i struggled with dysthymia for quite some ti ame. my current partner has a much more severe, life long experience with depression. she has very low periods lasting two weeks or so in which she is extremely withdrawn. i have had some relatable experiences in my life, so i do my best to reassure her it is ok to take some ti ame for herself, i understand, and i wi will give her the space she needs. it sincerely does not bother me, and she has had moments of intense appreciation for my understanding and patience with her. what i want to know, is if there is anything unique or special you have experienced during a low period from a partner that really stuck out to you? is space and understanding really the best i can do? if it is, i am absolutely ok with that. i am a patient person and i do not want to be overbearing.	moderate
i am so fucking alone i am sitting in my university is cafe and there is no one else here. it is a beautiful sunday afternoon and once again i wi will be by myself the entire day. i was supposed to eat with a friend but they did not show. at this point i am used to it. every day i wake up by myself, spend my day trying my hardest to not think about real life too much, and then going to sleep early in the morning. i am failing my classes since i can not bring myself to leave my room or i wi will just start fucking crying, which is what i am currently doing in the back of the cafe. every day this cycle drives me deeper in deeper into this ocean of negative emotions that i can not get out of and i hate myself for it. the only reason, and i mean the only reason, that i have not offed myself in some field is because it would devastate my family. they are everything to me and yet i am such a fucking thisappointment. they gave me everything and i never had any reason to be sad and yet here i am. i honestly do not know how much longer i can hang on. i am sorry for the wall of text but i just needed to get this out. for someone to hear and understand.	moderate

i am losing my mind i am losing it so much. my girlfriend is in the hospital because she drank so much and could not stop throwing up this morning. now she might be sent to a mental hospital because she is depressed and she has suicidal thoughts. i am over here now thinking why i did not stop her. why i did not i do something about it. why am i not good enough to do anything. why do i do the things i do. i love her so much and i do so much but at the same ti ame she has to realize she has stuff to do and can not be going out and getting all fucked up because we re depressed. i went through it and i pull myself out of that hole before by myself and i do not know where to start with her. i tell her not to do things and she goes and does it and i do not like that about her. i love her so much but we re both fucked up. i do not take care of myself all the ti ame because i hate myself so much and she tries to take care of herself but when she drinks or smokes she does not stop and would not stop until she is asleep and i worry so much about her and i do not know what to do about her. i am not breaking up with her because i love her and i really want to be with her and help her with what she needs help with but i can not help her if she does not put the effort in to be able to get better. i love her so much man. it honestly hurts.	moderate
depression . i suffered depression, or at least i thought i did when i was in my early s. after medication and some therapy, i got better. but now it is back. but it feels realer this ti ame. like, thisabling, isolating, scary. i feel drained and fragile. like i look back at before and think gee, i did not even know what depressed was compared to this , and anxiety feels much worse now. i feel less able to cope as well. i also am finding i am numb to hearing many of the same suggestions as the first ti ame. i do not know if i even really had depression the first ti ame in hindsight because it was never ever this bad. has anyone else had this? either way, any advice? while i am not trying to trivialise by making a si willy analogy, i can not think of any way to describe it than when you watch a movie and there is the bad guy, but actually, he is just a minion and the read bad guy is much worse. it is like this	moderate

please understand i feel like such a failure at with no job. every ti ame, i try to talk about this insecurity with my mom, she just brings up other parents with kids in si amilar situations. i just want her to realize that school was not the answer to everything. it was not her fault, but i want them to recognize i am dying on the side. yet, my mom wi will keeps saying hyperbolic phrases like she wants to die when i try to express it. i think about grabbing a razor blade and just cutting myself in front of her. i have been to a psych wards. i have been to jail. i tell her she should consider these suicide attempts because i was lost and had no idea what to do at the ti ame. i know it is all up to me, but i am such an asshole to myself. all this happened because it is a pain in the ass to give our dog a bath. i was planning on getting stuff done, but who am i kidding. i probably was not going to do anything anyways.	moderate
i am in high school and i want to die. exactly what the title says. i thought i felt bad in middle school but each year it just gets worse and worse, like sinking deeper and never reaching the bottom. waking up is so painful. i can not remember what it feels like to be happy. i sit in class and i amagine smashing my head against the desk while everyone around me talks about their dream colleges and boyfriends. life is piling up. i am left behind in everything and nobody notices or cares. i do not feel human anymore. i do not know what to do.	moderate
i am a dead worm buried meters deep i have had depression for almost half of my life, everyone around me is going places whilst i am here lost and rooted to my bed. i fucking hate it. i stopped getting any form of education, and i live in london which means i am definitely not going to get any decent job not to mention i can not vocally speak cause of my social anxiety . as soon as my sister finishes university i am going to finish myself off, until then i am going to try to i amprove. fucking hell, i am going to leech off my mum, why do i have to live so uselessly, ive tried going to the therapist, i forced myself going to school, i forced myself to go the gym, i forced myself socializing i forced myself and tried my best just to feel worse. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuxk fuck fuck fuc. i have lived my life always doing whatever the fuck i did not want to do because i never had other options, which built up this tower of shit that is now slowly collapsing on me. i just want to bash my head in, there more i try the worse it gets, realizing how hard is getting a job even if you have a degree is not motivational at all. i have no idea how some people can just wake up go to school consistently without even knowing what you want out of going to class, basically just raw dogging life. i wouldn t mind working. life is looking dark in the next few years, probably me having to work at mc dee is until i ki will myself, doing something i absolutely despise, i wi will be lucky if i can keep myself from ki willing myself during those ti ames. i am ranting out here cause i do not want to tell anyone, i do not want to worry anyone around me, it is easier to tell a bunch of faceless strangers on the internet because i do not have to know who knows how i feel. feels less lonely. i truly hope you guys would not give up like a weakling like me. i am such a shitty son, brother, cousin and nephew, you guys are lucky since i am not in your family.	moderate
suffering is life and life is suffering, and when you think your soul can not be smashed any further... i could write a list of life changing tragedies i have endured but you d think it was fiction. from falling feet and smashing bones and organs, to being robbed at gunpoint, to having my home and belongings trashed by a hurricane, to divorce, to joblessness and homelessness, body wracked with pain, painki willer addiction and liver thisease, etc etc and more... but those things are in the past right? but they are in my head everyday, and every night, and only sleep brings peace but i am unable to sleep more than an hour before waking up feeling sick. i have heard it all... god has a plan for you , ti ame heals everything , our struggles make us stronger , there is always someone worse off than you , etc etc. so why am i sti will here? why bother dragging out the suffering? everywhere i look i see fake people, narcissism, delusions of grandeur, masked contempt amp hate, jealousy, lies, backstabbers, power hungry bullies, and cri aminals and you know what? they win. over and over and over and over again i see and encounter individuals who really are despicable in their acts, deeds, and merits, and yet they are winning, happier than me, wealthier than me, with friends and adoring folk around them, even the ones they tread on daily. so this world is a nightmare i willusion, where evil triumphs and there is no real justice. the more fake you are, the more you make it and damnit, that is just not me. i am tired of it. it is enough. i am not brave enough to end my life, but i wish daily for it to end. now with all the fear mongering about coronavirus, i am hoping to get it. i look back at my life, and i look at my life, and i wish there was a delete button for it. i am pathetic, and i am ok with it now, life is pathetic and i see it as pointless. i could write more, but what is the point?	moderate

i am not here for me i constantly feel like i would be better off if i ran away or just thisappeared or even worse. and someti ames it is come down to that. i have attempted twice now and i did not regret it until i saw a face that i loved, and i knew loved me back. the first ti ame i took a shit ton of pi wills when my family was out. i felt so shit and i did not care. that is unti will my mum came home aboht minutes later. that is when i broke down and lost it and just cried and cried and cried for a day straight. the nd ti ame i had just left school and i went and sat on top of a multi story car park for hours on end until it got dark. i turned my phone off so nobody knew where i was, but i was not far from my school, maybe a minute walk. and at about pm i saw one of my teachers who had been at the shops to which this car park belonged. she came over to me and we talked and talked and talked and i broke down. recently i have been feeling the same way i did those two occasions, but the difference is i really really really do not want to put my family through it all again. my entire family broke down and all they were worried about is me. it is only just gotten to the point where if the phone rings my mum does not automatically assume i have been found dead or something. i really do not want to put them through any of that again, but i know that if it wouldn t efffect them, then i wouldn t think twice. i do not know what i should do from here. i do not feel i have anyone to talk to. i guess this is a really long winded way of me asking what are your coping mechanisms. i am sorry if this wasted you ti ame, i did not mean to, i guess i also just needed to vent and get it off my chest and could not think of anyone else to tell, so i chose a bunch of strangers on reddit! once again. i am sorry.	moderate

my therapist said it is my fault my mom hits me she asked me how my day was and i told her how my mom pushed me against a wall and hit me a few ti ames. she told me parents do not do that without a reason and i should ask her why she did it rather than guessing, and i should be nicer to her. she recommended i write an apology letter for whatever it was that i did to make my mom so mad in the first place. i failed a quiz in precalc 	moderate
i need honesty. i made a ton of mistakes that lead me to lose basically my whole friend group. it was over a female more or less. we became close friends and eventually friends with benefits. i was looking for more of a real relationship with her but whatever, fuck it. at this ti ame i legit only had friends left. my fwb let us call her k and two others. came by and my two other friends decided to ditch me. we dont hang out anymore and they dont even contact me unless i contact them first. whatever. i sti will have k, right? we have a weird relationship. she knows that she can give me mini amal attention and i would stick around, but we hang out basically every day. she is using me. i know she is. but fuck, i just enjoy being in someone is company. i am so fucking desperate for companionship of any kind that i am literally breaking my back to do everything for this girl. and i honestly dont mind it i really like her and enjoy being around her, and she seems to feel the same way. recently the past days she is been thistant. i know i am losing her. it fucking sucks. it wouldn t be so bad if i had someone to talk to, but i dont. she does not even give me the ti ame of day to respond. what the fuck could i have done wrong. so i have decided that if i have no one, i might as well die. if i for sure lose k, i am as good as dead. so i dont know if this is a dead mans manifesto or a cry for help. if at least someone reads this then i wi will know my voice was maybe heard. i am so fucking alone.	moderate
guilty feeling this was a rant so sorry in advance for the grammar i just feel so guilty all the ti ame. i feel guilty for not talking to people who want to help me, but i do not want to bother them and i wi will feel guilty for bothering them if i open up to someone. my counselor keeps saying that i should talk to people and people genuinely do not mind, but i really can not wrap my head around it. why would anyone want to listen to my bullshit problems? why do i matter? i live in a first world country and have so many opportunities. i can not complain about anything. but then again, if someone i know from the same country has problems, i take it seriously and do not think they are overreacting at all. i just have a problem with myself. i really want to get better but it is just so fucking hard and i want to feel something again but i can not. i just feel numbness, emptiness and darkness and i want to be the happy child i once was. i want to enjoy all the things i used to love, but i just can not. i keep trying and trying but it just keeps getting worse. i just feel so hopeless and like a useless piece of shit. i keep comparing myself to others and i know i should not but i just keep doing it. i feel like such a useless sack of shit and i do not deserve anything. i would love to have a partner but i do not think anyone would want to deal with how i am. i would understand but it kind of hurts that i wi will never really be in a partnership. i know life is not about finding a partner but it would be nice you know. i do not even know what i am talking about anymore, so i wi will stop here. thanks for reading	moderate
the truth is it is all my fault.. i can not handle this world, there is too much evil, too much injustice, and i am too weak to handle it. i can not and wi will never learn to play normal just to survive. i see too much, know too much, i can not just ignore it all. i envy people who do. it is all my fault, why am i so weak, so damn sensitive to all the bad things.. i do not want to be this way, nobody could help me, and now i am dying for real because of it. i am too broken, depression is not something i have, it is my default state, i do not remember a ti ame when i was truly happy and unburdened. i always, always, always see the bad.. now i only hope for a quick and painless death but all that is is front of me is more suffering and a painful death. fuck me....	moderate
am i even depressed or just lazy amp ugly? i dont go out my dorm because i am naturally ugly which motivates me to waste even more money on takeout food despite having a damn school cafeteria. i waste soo much money and i also have to worry about student debt after i graduate as well. i havent been out of my dorm room since thursday, i only gone out to get food from a online delivery app that delivers to my dorm or just go to the bathroom. i dont even go out to my cafeteria because that means i have to wear mascara and do my hair and brushy teeth. i havent brush my teeth for almost days and i can smell my thisgusting breath and havent showered for almost days either, my lips are even dry. my legs are hairy, hairy pelvis, and have se under arm hair but i just cover it up. i sleep in my mascara and contact lenses for days. i would someti ames take off my contact lenses and keep on the mascara and sleep. i would wear stupid fake eyelashes or curl my eyelashes if i had to go out and go to the delivery person who goes to my dorm. my dorm room is slightly messy, its a single room in a do apartment. i dont even speak to my roommates or even talk to them for days because i am in my room. i dont even want to be around them if it means them seeing me without mascara. my room has piling laundry, my room slightly stinks if you focus enough, and i someti ames would have an equivalent to a basement dweller gamer piss jugs but instead its ziploc bags. i dont have friends and i never hung out with anyone since middle school. i never had a fun summer vacation, i was always in my room. i wasted my whole ass youth and i am years old and i am about to be in summer. getting a job means no more summer vacations, ever. or having any fun ever. i wi will look back on my college and youth with nothing but thisgust, sadness, and loneliness. i was thinking about joining a school club if possible despite graduating in may but i think people might judge me, especially if i go alone. am i depressed or am i just a lazy nasty fuck up?	moderate
i am losing everything i used to love i have always known there was something wrong with me but it is only now it is started getting properly serious. honestly i blame schools, the stress and social anxiety we re put through day after day is unnecessary but it seems like no one cares. and now i have got to the point where i have lost motivation and feeing for the things i used to love. firstly i am a runner. i run meters on track and i was among the top athletes in scotland, i have been training for about years but now i find i am looking for excuses not to go, and when i do run i do not have the motivation to run through pain, i choose to slow down or even give up completely. i hate it but i can not help it then there is love. i had a relationship for years and now i have blown it. i just started to lose feeling. si ample as that, and she could sense it. i hate what i have become	moderate
feeling suicidal again. i just feel extremely low and have a consuming fear that no one wi will ever love me romantically. i am and have made threads on this before, but i can not seem to feel good about myself. i just want to hang myself. i can not see anyone ever falling in love with me, even though i am described as having many great qualities and a sweet personality. this pretty much all stems from the child abuse i received growing up told i was unlovable and would never be enough all the ti ame while being beaten. the scars just never go away...i just want the pain to stop	moderate

depression and failing school. a while ago from september november of to now as well i woke up every morning thinking i was going to ki will myself that night so i would put effort through the day. i am in high school, and i had loss of credit from how low my grades got. however on november th i met someone that almost flipped my life around. he gave me reason to live and made me promise not to ki will myself. but i already failed so much that i think it is too late to keep trying. i have been trying to fix everything but it is hard cause i keep getting these suicidal thoughts. it is so much work and my brain shuts down the moment i am overwhelmed. idk what to do, i can not fail my sophomore year but i can not ki will myself i guess. one option is way easier than the other, but it wi will hurt everyone around me. getting help is not any easier cause no adults can know i am a danger to myself. any advice?	moderate
yup. i completely hate myself. i hate the way i look, i hate the way my voice sounds when i talk, and i am utterly thisgusted with the way i interact with others. there is not one thing i like and i feel it pushing me closer to the edge. i use to be tons of fun now, i am nothing but a shell of a sad soul with a sad life. i can not even i amagine me getting old or having kids. i feel as though i am suppose to die before that ti ame comes. i am stuck in my head, living in the past and wishing i was dead.	moderate

fml. i have lost so many friends due to me not feeling like i was good enough and telling myself that they hated me, and not being able to express myself. fast forward to years later and i know i am depressed and that is why i had those thoughts, but they are long gone and i have to now deal with this on my own. they probably think of me as a terrible friend and i feel like they are better off without me. i do not deserve them. i feel like i let them down and even if i tried reaching out they would be so annoyed at me, which i totally understand.	moderate
when i am not at work i have nothing to take my mind off my depression just nothing at all. i have no hobbies and i am only left with dark intrusive thoughts about things that make me want to ki will myself. the loops are repetitive, monogamous and meretricious. with that being said it is because i am so thisconnected from my real self that i do not know how to access myself when left with my thoughts. it is only defense mechanisms and all the ti ame in the world to wonder about the philosophy of why. the self loathing that fogs all my perceptions just is not fun. all i want to do is not exist. i do not know how not to think as if i was an academic text book. i do not know the first thing about creative ability and bring truly spontaneous with life. i do not have flow. i am not well orchestrated. instead of stagnated. floating until life passes me by and i die. i feel so embarrassed even writing this. i feel embarrassed to live. masking at work is not a substitute for living, i just always feel like i am drowning	moderate

thisastrous life, need help i am a year old from a third world country, i have been increasingly depressed with how my life is and with every breath i take i feel its too much for me to bear so i am here! so thing starts in grade when my ambitious mom decides to get me admitted to a very posh school where only the richest kids go and mind you my family was no where near rich and were only able afford my education through cutting all our spending in other places. so the first year in that school goes horribly wrong with me having trouble to adjust with other kids as most would just make conversation about the things i can only hope to have in my dreams so i mostly kept quiet and everybody started picking on me and bullying me to the point that anyone who even talked with me was labelled as a uncool person and other people would avoid that person. years went like this where every minute in school felt like a nightmare and my only happiness came from playing games on a half busted computer. grade came, i got switched to a different section and got a new bunch of people that did not know me, so i started lying about everything and made some brand new friends and also fell in love with a girl but guess what she made me her best friend but rejected me as a boyfriend clearly indicating affection for ripped dudes with muscles, while i was here who can not even afford to get a gym membership i am skinny af . i give my o levels grade exams and did moderately well and guess what i did not even get a good job from my dad. then suddenly my parents tell me i can not go to school anymore as they can not afford it so i only get private tuition by teachers who do not belong to any school. in the mean ti ame my family goes broke to the point that we can no longer afford the moderately sized apartment and have to move to a literal cave, this house has rooms only which is cluttered with furniture and no light comes here, this alone made me consider suicide, now my a level exams are months away and i am heavily under prepared as all i do is nothing and listen to sad songs. mind you i literally skipped my family problems, tldr my father does not live with me as he does his work in a different state and my mother hates hi am and he in turn hates her, my sisters life is , to say the least destroyed and that has caused her to do all sorts of crazy things, like she for months straight thought my parents were conspiring to her! amidst these things here i am with a crazy inferiority complex to the extent that makes me feel down at everything i do in life. now the few friends i have are all going to better places to study and now i have no one left in my life, no friends, intense loneliness. my love for money is the same as a homeless person, money would have solved all my problems so everywhere i go i can only think of becoming a rich af, it hurts that all the people i used to hang out with have so much money from their parents and i start out with no money at all. i am wi willing to work to become some bi willionaire but the thought that it might not work at all and i might stay the same old poor me with no life no friends no money no wife, this feeling of anti hope makes me want to hang myself. i have tried committing suicide once before and got caught while putting my head through the noose and the scream of my mother made me not want to do it. now nothing feels good, nights go by crying the dark alone. if you belong to the that read through that please respond and say anything, i want a human to understand my position right now. thanks to all responders in advance 	moderate
struggling hard right now ive been really struggling to be positive at all lately and it hits me hard whenever i have a bit of quiet ti ame to myself. over the past few months a lot has changed for me, some good, a lot bad. work is not going so great which is hard for me as it used to be such an i amportant part of my life, now i just feel isolated and fi willed with dread whenever i am there, like an uneasy feeling i can not really explain or shake. i have a feeling like my life is going nowhere and i am not progressing as a human being, like i am not the man i sould be, the fact i am sti will fairly young doesnt come to mind, i feel like i am running out of ti ame and i havnt got much to show for myself a few months back i met girl, through a friend during a weekend of mountain biking one of the few things i can do right now that helps me forget for a few hours at least we sort of hit it off and became good friends rather quickly, something rare for me being autistic and having a lot of social problems. obviously i started to catch feelings for her, and after seeking a shite load of advice from close friends and a few failed attempts i finally scrapped together thr courage to tell her how i felt, i got a very thoughful knock back something i was expecting deep down and we both said that remaining friends wi will be completely okay, part of the reason i struggled to share my feelings was the fear of losing a good friend. however i know feel like i am slowly being pushed away. i am really struggling to cope with this lately as i feel like i have yet again ruined something that was going well in my life and i have been really beating myself up about the whole thing, getting the almost relentless feeling of being completely alone that i am right for nobody. i also have a very self destructive tendency to convince myself that nobody really cares about me, despite having some very close friends, some that i have actually grown closer to over recent months. friends that can make me feel that they love and care about me when i am with them can turn into people that wouldnt really care about me if i was to thissapear when left alone with my mind. the only thing i have found that helps with these feelings is tasking myself to do things to keep my mind ocupied, tasks that i have to think about fully when doing them that i can not think about anything else. i have chopped a hell of a lot of firewood in the past few days. but i can not do that sort of thing , which is when all those feeling flood back in. relentlessly. without fail. i dont really know what to do anymore and honestly i am pretty damn scared	moderate

i am always angry i am angry with how people treat one another, i am angry about how i have been am treated on a regular basis, i am angry with how my life has turned out, i am angry that i have been misguided, and i seem to be more and angry every day i struggle to find any kind of solace in anything, and i do not believe any thinking techniques truly work at all. people equate changing behavior to changing thinking, but that is not the case. i can not stop feeling angry. i have no outlet because it is . too late to change the past events that i am angry about, and . nothing i do wi will change anything in the present. i am sick of being alive, i am sick of always feeling left out, thisrespected, alone, and without a sense of community or belonging. i am surrounded by closed minded people who live in echo chambers, and who never believe they do anything wrong. everything seems to end up being my fault , regardless of my involvement. my lived experience has been like this for the past years. i thought things would get better when i got older but nothing really did. i am sti will me, and i am not someone i am proud to be. i wish so much that i had had better company, guidance, support, and quality of mental state. but it is too late to change anything	moderate

my terrible life story, i am done i am not suicidal first off, its my first post ever on reddit so sorry for the mistakes i am going to do, also sorry for the title, i do not want to annoy anyone but its just how i feel currently... and to anyone who has a soft hearth you should better stop reading, i am going to talk about some more extreme stuff and idk, i just felt to warn. to be honest i am not even sure how to start... well i am going to write now my story down, i am typing this via tor so i should be not in direct risk of a police investigation. i am currently , going to school have an . and i just going to tell now my story, i sti will dont know how to start after thinking for mins. i got the information from my mother that when i was in the kindergarden i had no emphatic abilitys, she told me that i walked over kids and so on, i also was in therapies for some years to gain some of these abilitys and to become atleast normal and dont be stupid, also i am sure that i got there my interest for sience. i had i amages from that ti ame that ive builded as example two towers connected by another and i also builded around that ti ame out of lego complex stuff and i liked to help others, also the only other thing i remember was that ive had in a game ti ames a . then i was going to an special school wich started with an th class yep i know it sounds like bs but its not... actually its not lied but its bs it was a smaller school wich i had an unbeliveable nice teacher, she even allowed us to ride once on her parents horses. then our class had split up bec we were too less and a while after i was in the new class i switched to an normal school, i can not tell when exactly or why the school got closed some years later since it would give hints instandly to me. in the new school i was in a relation ship with a girl slided her pants down the list ti ame we saw us, i know thesedays its thinking over sexualized but back in the ti ame it was just doctorgames or something like that, also i tell it here since it wi will be relevant later on. in the new school i had female friends, i often did hurt them at games like hidenseek but didnt understand that i did that, i was sti will lacking emphaty, they all remember me as an idiot, the teachers said i should think about my actions but i didnt know what thinking was. also i should mention that it was like ive skipped a class since as example what we would do in the th class they do in the th, one more information is that i never learned the abc or this other form of writing. in that ti ame i had doctorgames with another girl but without touching, the next day she talked about everyone about it and while that ti ame i watched sience shows for years, in that ti ame i had my first depression since i started to think and to understood that our lifes are useless, i was also scared of the power of nature. i am not sure if it was here that my mom had a shop in another country with my aunt. i drove like every weekend and holiday for years there, on the way i first ti ame learned to controll what i see, in your words i amanigation, from that point on i done it like extremly often. around that ti ame when i was out i had my first friend outside of the school, we were often in the forest doing shit, with my belgium cousin we played minecraft on a virus flooded laptop from me and yea life was si ample for me. its ti ame to let the shit go down once a battle over money came up and we litterally fleed with an other cousin wich lived at my aunt out of the country, we did hide our car somewhere and he broke multible windows and raced in a zone with and lost after that they his license for a while, we escaped to our home country. then my mom opened her own buisness. meanwhile i came in the th grade and had fun batteling with th graders in sience and i also learned that my brain is slowly advancing stupidly fast, a teacher gave me a long mathematic x ... and he just gave me one precalculated one, i remember that i didnt know what etc means but after min watching it i learned to calculate such equaltion , also in my head i could controll my dreams, i builded up a futurist world where everything is fine and the technologys i created over ti ame in my head are real machines wich are innovative. i didnt make really friends at that ti ame, it didnt bother me. in th grade i had a social teacher helping me since i saw her as a mother at that ti ame my head started to let me see memories like a video, my brain adapted to an pc analysing like vision, my math grades exploded, also i kept rooms i was in in my head and on the floor when light was off i could overdraw what i see with red lines and also i could manipulate my own memories wich fucked me since i am not sure if anything i tell here isnt a fucking manipulation in that ti ame i was often in i willegal streams too to watch ani ame, once i got interested and just pressed on a ad with flat boobs, i keep doing that until i came to a page with pornhub at start and a link going my entire screen, it was my first contact with cp. to this day i am sure that some people from pornhub host in normal net childporn but just hide it extremly well. also wtf can a little kid find cp but not some fucking paid police officers.... then it interested me, i didnt get hard or something, it was just sheer the new wich dragged me to get tor and seach stuff up and i did find it and i watched it a whole year, i wanted to know why people do such things and so on, it just interested me their motives, i know its terrible and i am preparing already for the negative karma flood but yea, watched reddit videos . then i skipped a class again. in my new class my grades exploded in the prositiv and i met a girl, the girl teached me emotions over ti ame, in winter also i had a relation started with a girl wich i played often and we videochatted alot, she was a year younger then me, you need to know that i was fat at that ti ame and some people really though i am old, even tho i wasnt even ... her brother forced us to stop contact. after that i was down and really sad. at that spring my head started to hurt a bit always and slowly i my ability to remember stuff got bad, when i overjumped i knew wich cloth everyone had to any day, i could give exact dialogs some days after so on. at that ti ame i stopped the relation with my best and first real friend i had since he emotionally abused me. my parents splitted also up a year before and my mom moved to another man and left me and my brother together at a home, i was the one who said yes but yea, i also saw all the abuse from my parents aganist each other... even the blood on the floor. but back in the ti ame now i also slept like hrs everyday... i also stopped really learning new things men while i type this down i stopped and started alot of shit lol she also teached me how to talk normal and not just in complicated words, funny thing is i can now just talk so and not complicated. i also took an iq test wich revealed that i am very close to autism, my brain structure is different and the test were made in catergory s, in one i had point and

i went to get help...again i finally got an appointment with a doctor and nurses. they were the nicest ones i have met so far. they took me seriously and were active in finding appropriate help for me. the doctor told me nice things to calm me down, she gave me a prescription for new medication, made sure i could afford it, sent requests to see a therapist and a psychiatrist closeby and gave me another appointment in weeks. it is far from what i got last year. i am glad i went to this new place. i am completely drained from this and sti will feel worthless, but now i know someone reliable has my back and takes my mental health seriously.	moderate
how can you just trust someone? i really wonder how that works. i trust them but as soon as they leave, i am like shit why did i say that . these past few days i just saw again how wrong people are and yet again can not trust anyone. all they do is, while telling you something, trying to push you to tell something back so they know something about your family. and i just do not understand anymore, all i can see is people laughing with someone and turning around to roll their eyes. so why should not they do that to you too? its the same thing with texting, i can not do it. it feels so fake, every emoji they use and the things they say. so please tell me, how do you do it? how can you trust someone? or do i just have the luck and do not know genuine people? i do not know if this is really the right place to post this but i know that i am tired about living like this.	moderate
i am falling back into depression and i do not know what to do so i am in my early s, i am cis female and i am lesbian. i have severe anxiety but i am a musician so i interact with a lot of different people. i always try to be nice to people and move on with my life. i am a private person so i do not ask too much about others and expect the same in return. so basically this dude dms me and says he likes my music, i thank hi am for the support and send hi am an unreleased track which is not abnormal for me, i send my music to anyone who wi will listen . so one day i do a qna and he asks me, how does p!ssy taste? this shakes me up kinda because even though i do not hide my sexuality, i keep it to myself and do not go into detail. i tell hi am to never ask me something like that again and says he understands, i brush it off as a one ti ame occurrence. i decide to start to dry text more than i usually do, avoid, and thistance. one day he dms me again, and is like, check my story. i tell hi am that there is no way i am doing that without knowing whats on the story. he tells me he plans on dropping his ex girlfriend is nudes but tells me whats on his story is just a fight, i shut hi am down i ammediately and tell hi am what he wants to do is i willegal. i do not click the story and i move on. the last occurrence was after he sent me a meme. i sent hi am a emoji hoping to end the conversation naturally then out of no where he is like, this girl tried to send me titty pics but got mad when i said i did not care again, i shut hi am down and was like, i do not want to talk about this and i am not the person to speak to on this. he says he understands and is like, i respect that, i am just really young so i do not understand things like that. that freaks me out, like this dude knew i do not thiscuss sexual things. i just tell hi am, everyone has boundaries . he described me as family friendly to my face. i do not know anything about this person, he did mention something about being three in when nicki minaj was famous but i have no way of verifying that. so that brings me to recent events, i end up telling hi am to stop contacting me i made a public post about leaving me alone that was partially at hi am and to set firm boundaries . out of morbid curiosity i go onto his twitter. i see an omegle chat where he clai ams to be but who really knows, i scroll down and i see that he is tweeted out pornhub videos which is something i do not see very often . i go onto his likes and at first it is just some sports stuff. i decide to scroll down some more and it goes from porn out of context clips to hentai, some weird hentai too like girl being roughly screwed by humanoid pig creature porn. that is when it clicks why he did not respect my boundaries, it puts everything else into context as well. so that brings me to where i am right now. i feel conflicted. i feel like this is my fault because i did not research who this person fully was, granted i shut down certain topics if i felt like they were going in a direction i did not like. i handled it the best i could. i blocked hi am shortly after. i feel stupid and weak because i did not stand up for myself but i just assumed it was going to end up being a one ti ame event and the first ti ame was a si ample misunderstanding. i mini amized, i wi will be real. i know i sound stupid but i feel like a slipped up and let a boundary of mine be thisrespected, i had just been trying to not go off on people and be civil but it did not work. it makes me feel sick but at the same ti ame guilty. my anxiety is telling me i did something i willegal unintentionally. i feel somewhat violated by this whole experience but i feel shame because i am not sure how i should react. i feel weak because i should have stood up for myself.	moderate
drunk friend told me i was attention seeking. rant i know people probably would not read, and that is fine, i just need to get it out last night i was at a party, celebrating my birthday. we were just vibing for hours. then suddenly my friend stands up talking about how he knows everything, since he is older than the rest of us. then saying something like if you say you re depressed or want to ki will yourself, you re just antention seeking. if you actually wanted to ki will yourself, you would just do it. no offence my name and uses sources like i have suffered from depression and anxiety since i was , and tried to ki will myself ti ames he never say things like this sober, but i know he thinks it. and i just wish he understood that when i joke about depression or suicide it is either because i try to cope with it. or i have a good day, so i try to reach out and get help to get away from the very bad days. not because i want to be the depressed dude . i do not want to depressed or known as a depressed person. i mean maybe i am attention seeking, if attention is not getting ignored for days... if you have read everything, thank you lt 	moderate

feeling lost what do you do when you do not view the closest person in your life the same anymore? how does it feel to feel used? to feel like you were just a fi willer? i was very close to my friend, perhaps too close for just a friendship, but too thistant to be labeled a relationship. we both got drunk one night. we got in a physical altercation. he hurt me but hurt hi am more. i ran off. i did not know how to respond. i tried to push hi am away, but i could not. we gravitated back, but we weren t the same. we could not be. now, all i have is this void. i know this is only temporary. everything is only temporary. it sti will hurts though. where do i go next? how do i move on? nothing feels like i am making the right choice. i am not suicidal, i am just very hurt. i know, in the end, i wi will be fine. i just need to feel like i am okay right now. sorry if this is too vague, but it is just so hard to express myself.	moderate
i can no longer look at r wholesomememes. .. i have accepted i wi will not meet anyone or ever have another relationship, my depression and anxiety has i amproved so much however, from life has shown me... i have just needed to accept i would not find anyone and wi will not have a husband or family. i understand life is not all about having a family or getting married but it felt like huge thing for me and realising that i wi will never be good enough, attractive enough, funny, smart, you name it enough for anyone... its soul destroying but i am focusing on my hobbies, my job and building myself an independent life part of my self i amprovement, i would go on wholesome memes when i felt down... and now, i just can not face it nearly every one is about how loved people are, how beautiful people are etc and it just is not my life. i wi will miss you wholesome memes	moderate
i only talk to a few people about my depression and suicidal thoughts and it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life i was drunk and super suicidal one night because i fought with a few friends and was feeling super guilty about it tried to down all my pain ki willers, drunkenly message them and people i thought i could trust saying shits like i really hate myself and if i do die it is not your fault etc . they started screenshooting and sending it to another person who is not super close friends with but we had a small argue before , and the person spread not pictures but just talked about it saying that i was doing it for attention and i was faking my suicide attempts, saying that i was fake drunk because i typed weird when i was talking to my friends. and then they started to spread around about how i was faking all my suicide attempts and no one even reach out to me, no one asked for what happened, everyone just agreed with that person without asking me. i thought i could trust them man, i really did. i thought that if something happen to them i would donate my kidney or take a bullet for them in a heart beat. i do not get it man, i do not get how you can do that to a person. how you can say i am being suicidal for attention. that person even said that they have depression but then turned to me and said that i am acting like a victi am. no one in the group asked me what was going on or even tried to act like they cared. i even apologized for my suicidal rant in the group chat but i ended up getting ignored left on read. and they said that i do not put in the effort to try to talk to them. they even months later... i tried to stop being friends with them but i wanted my favorite srunchie i left in p is car. i asked for it back, they screenshot it and send it to the group chat and started to make fun of me.	moderate
seriously contemplating suicide ive had sever anxiety, and depression for the past or so years, and this just pushed me over the edge. i moved back into my moms house about a year ago. since then her cat has fallen i wi will, so i have been paying the the cats vet bi will s. shes going to end up needing a surgery that wi will cost k in a town hours away. my moms house needs around k of repairs done or else we are risking out health living in mold. i dont give shits about my health but i want my mom, and her pest to be healthy. she can not afford any of this so i am obligated to pay for all of it. i personally saved k, and i have about k in my trust fund, and another k in a little while because my brother wi will be buying out my half of the house. i would just use that money to pay for repairs, and such, but my dad, and mom dont get along, so my dad would be livid if i used my trust fund on my mother is house. i know my grand parents wouldnt be happy iether. i know i am probably being a little bitch, but i just needed to vent about this.	moderate
coming to terms with being depressed coming to terms with depression may not be the best way to describe it. what i do know is i am finally starting to write this in the shower because i have been putting it off for days. maybe the warm water is giving me comfort and enabling it, can not be to sure. all i know is i have spent the last week in bed dreading pm because i just did not want to go to work. did not want to have to fake it until you make it again. and it is an oddly normal thing for me. a vicious circle with no end in sight. i do not feel suicidal right now. i am thinking about being dead, but the guilt of leaving my family behind is preventing it. it is crazy how a family can change how you live and your general outlook on life. anyway, my thoughts are all over the place and it is difficult to even stay on one subject for me nowadays. what i am saying is, i am depressed and that is okay. what is not okay is me not doing anything about it. but it is just not that easy, i tell myself and everyone i give advice too that it is. and show the resources available but i just can not shake it. it does not go away ever, ever since i was a just a young lad. even when i first started talking to my now wonderful girlfriend back in freshman year of high school. even last week when i was laughing at a dad joke a co worker made. it is such a scary thing to accept i might succumb to it. like how cancer takes people everyday, so does depression. but i just can not get help. i know how, and could find a way to afford it. just can not, do not know why i am making this post. maybe to find like minded people, maybe to find the help. maybe to feel better for saying even just a bit for a few minutes. maybe because i would not wake up when i finally doze off. i just do not know anymore. your friend me	moderate
i am at the deep i just do not want to see a face, any face not even mine. i do not talk to my friends, when they try to tell me something, i just answer them short, because i do not want to see them, i do not want to talk to them. they were once my best friends, now i hate them. i hate everyone. my mother lives far away because of her job. i have not called her in months and have not answered her calls. i am down to kilos. i never have breakfast. i do not eat lunch at school, someti ames i do not even eat dinner. i do not study or do homework. my grades are going just above the passing grade. i ask myself why, why do i hate everyone and everything, why do i hate my friends who tries to talk to me, why do i hate my parents who always supported me and never stopped loving me. why do i hate my brother who always helped with every problem i hade. just why.	moderate

i feel like i am decaying i am not sure if this is necessary, but most of the wording i feel sounds si amilar to an ed, so i guess i just wanted to put that as a thisclai amer in case that could be a trigger to anyone. my brain used to be the only thing i worried about, but now my weight has dropped a significan not amount due to never having an appetite anymore and it is scaring me more than ever because something i used to brush off as me faking it is now seen physically, making me more aware of the state i am in. i have put off getting help since i was . now i am , and i feel like all my emotional problems follow me to the mirror. or when i am having a good day, a friend wi will make a comment or a joke about my weight, and i know it comes from a place of concern as i have also been told but it is just a slap in the face reminder that i am not okay and i sti will need help. i feel like now my friends are watching me crumble because my outside now matches the inside, and it makes me uncomfortable. i do not like the worry or pity. i know i have to seek help, yet i can not stop putting it off because i am just too afraid. i am basically watching myself get worse and worse but not doing anything about it. it is frightening because part of me does not even care. i panic because i hate looking so small. but someti ames when i know i should eat more to start to actually get myself back on track, i wonder why bother? on my lowest days it is almost like i want to watch myself decay as some form of punishment. which sounds terrible and i feel gross and embarrassed even writing that. i am hoping more than anything that i can find the motivation to finally talk to a professional tomorrow.	moderate
my relationship is collapsing. and i can only cry about it because it is all going down because of my depression. when we started dating, my partner said we would work on this together. i have been there during all the tough ti ames for my partner and i helped and stood strong for us. but when the ti ame came for my partner to do so for me... apparently it is too hard. so here i am, drowning, realizing that i wi will lose everything we built for the past two years because my depression is too much to handdle. i know it is over and there is no turning back. i just can not accept it. no one loves you when you re depressed. not even the other people with depression too.	moderate
it rarely gets better without help today i woke up, and my fist though was not suicide or self harm. i am sti will getting used to that. i have been through countless prescriptions, alternatives and therapists, and it never made a difference, i was born broken. tagged with major depression at age , on a watch list for over years after that and since weeks ago i finally feel free. who knew a handful of pi will could do that to me? i have never been without depression, and i feel stable. i am sti will me, dark jokes, preparing for the worst, a little slutty, witty, boisterously obnoxious laugh, cat crazy, kind and prone to walls of text. side effects? totally manageable, nothing major. i went through over different prescriptions and wrote everything in my notepad, but sadly my notes would benefit no one but me, as my brain is unique, and so is yours. keep writing and talking to those who are supposed to help. change doctors if you feel they are not doing their jobs, hell, i went through psychiatrists until my latest found out i suffer from paradoxical reactions to certain neurotransmitters, and the only test for that was to feed me a bunch of pi wills and then ask for my notes on them. he got the right prescription, and i am finally me. applied for a job last night, about to take a shower today, out of my own volition. i am not perfect yet. sti will anxious, scared and stuff but for the first ti ame in my life, hopeful. i wi will not be telling anyone what my prescription is because it probably would not work for you as it did for me. but there is hope. i am fucking crying while writing this, please do not give up. if you can not do it any more, i can not tell you to hold on and keep going, but i can tell you that medicine keep advancing, and that they found something for me. it wi will most likely get better with the right help, therapy and pi wills. i am finally on the other side, and it feels fantastic. please join me, and live.	moderate
people say they want to listen but never really do nobody really listens when i try to say what is going on. and even when someone says that they do want to listen they just brush off everything that i say. sharing what i am going through and what i am feeling is hard enough but when that happens then i do not want share anymore even after their further prompting. it hurts. it forces me to bury what i feel deep inside. people say they listen but they do not. they ask for me to reword it when i am saying exactly what i am feeling. they tell me that what i am feeling is not really what i said but how do they know? how can you tell me what i am feeling if you re you and i am me? that is not how it works. it just makes me feel more like an alien and a freak.	moderate
my path in life is a dead end. it turned into a rant and sorry for bad grammar my m life feels empty and it feels like my life have stopped and i do not know where to go from here. like i do not even know if i have a right to complain seeing the struggles of other people on here. i have not really accomplished very much in life but i a steady job a car and recently gotten a house but it all just feels.. useless. since i was a little kid i dreamed of the day i would grow up and be in a relationship with someone. when i was pretty much all of my friend either had been is or was in a relationship but i was the nerdy friend so i felt left behind. when i was i had my first relationship and that was just a thisaster, nothing i did was good enough, her family pretty much hated me her mother even tried to set her up with someone else . while i might not be the greatest person in the world i do not think iam that bad. then like a year or so after i broke up with her i got into a relationship with another girl that was pretty much a prefect. it was great, we pretty much never had any fights and life was just really good even though we were just living in a small room apartment and i would trade everything i have now to go back to that. if it is too good to be true it usually is. after she told me she had been messing with another guy at a party i just shut down, i did not react in anger or anything but was just speechless. i tried to keep the relationship going but could not shake that off. after i broke up with her i pretty much stopped going out and got my current job and have not really done anything except working and playing video games. i bought a van so i could turn it in to a party bus so maybe i would want to go out partying but nope, just moved into a house when i ask myself for a reason why i got the house it just boils down to me wanting to be attractive to girls. me having a house, a car, a good job would not help me getting a relationship since it is my personality that is holding me back. iam not a good looking guy and do not have the personality to back that up, i have tried online dating but have only gotten one match and that did not work out at all. if we look at life like waking along a path then i have turned up to a dead end with nowhere to go. thanks for reading and have a good day night.	moderate

i refuse to be attached. i just got a dog in hopes that she would help me with my depression. even though i have only had her for a day and a half, it did the polar opposite. it made me realize i am too much of fucked up cunt to even take care of her. if i can not take care of myself how can i take care of a dog? it made me realize how truly depressed i am as i slowly watched her become depressed in a matter of a day from this shitty small spaced apartment i live in. her separation anxiety did not help me either considering she was stupidly aggressive towards me if i even tried to leave. i balled my eyes out realizing how really fucked i am in the head for about an hour straight now. i could not help but breakdown as soon as i gave her back and got back inside. i am tired of being attached to anything in general. everyti ame i try with someone or something i only become more empty as i tend to get used a lot and i trust too easily. sorry if i am ranting, i am just drowning in my tears and i really needed somewhere to dump this.	moderate
no one truly cares i am and i have no real friends. the few friends i did have rarely ever talk to me anymore as they have found more fun people to hang around with. i have been told that i am depressing to be around, so i guess it was only a matter of ti ame before the people i knew just stopped caring about me. they hardly answer my texts or calls, and even if they do it is clear they could not give a rats ass what is going on in my life. i just wanted someone to listen to me as i have always been there for them but i guess that is too much to ask. my entire life i have felt like a tool. every relationship i have had ends the same way romantic or otherwise. they use me and then toss me aside once they find someone else more exciting or attractive to be around. it does not matter that i am there for them . none of them really ever cared. the only reason why i have not done the deed is because my mom said if i ever did she would do it too because she could not live without me. everyday is a struggle to get up and i feel like i am just wasting everyones ti ame. i do not know what to do anymore. i can not help but feel it is all my fault. i just wish someone would stick by me as i have stuck by others. it feels like i am drowning and everyone i know is just staring at me but pretending like they do not see it. i guess i am just not i amportant enough to care about.	moderate

i constantly dream of how life used to be i have just turned and am in my nd year studying games design at uni, it is going okay but i feel there are constantly people who are much better than me around me so what are my chances of making it right? life just seems like it has nothing left to give, that i have seen as much as i am ever really going to get to. if i want to see or do the great things you see other people do then you need to make and make it and make money but i am never going to get to that point. i am constantly thinking about how life was when i was back in secondary school and when i was younger having more friends, having such excitement for the world and what i wi will get to see and experience, being able to just have fun, having a functioning family and so many other things. everyone always said to wait until you get out into the real world, where you can do what you want and experience whatever you want....welp, here i am and it is shit. it is fucking grey, it is fucking dull and it is boring. my eyes do not show a lot of happiness anymore. i wouldn t necessarily say i am suicidal in the literal sense, i have not really thought about ki willing myself but i have a lot of suicidal ideation i guess? when i am walking across a road i just wish a car would hit me and it would all be over or some crazed man wi will just come and stab me nice and easy like. i am not scared about the experiences i wouldn t get to have or the people i would leave behind...just the pain of going through with it. if i could have a pi will that would take me out of existence or it just put me in a golden sleep that i never wake up from i would probably take it and that is the honest truth	moderate

anybody else notices you get treated differently by others once they find out you have depression anxiety etc? or that you grew up in a fucked up environment? i have lost count how many ti ames i have experienced this. a potential friend or my boyfriends friends find out i lost my mom in middle school, that i was abused, that i was in foster care, and i ammediately you hear the soft oh... or i am sorry about that... and watch them take a step back from you emotionally because they think you re unstable or need to be coddled. then they start to ghost you because you re the damaged and weird kid and they would rather not deal that. this has happened so many ti ames that unless i really have to i do not tell them about my past, yet since this is a small town everybody finds out easily, especially the younger people around my age. i am so sick of this shit and it really deters needs from wanting to make friends because i am always treated like i have some contagious thisease. fuck be yourself shit, i have tried that for years and all i get is getting name called, ghosted after a few hang outs, whatnot. i do not even allude to the fact i am messed up, because i hide it well when i am around others. does anybody else experience this?	moderate

have not felt like myself in a while hi everyone. since starting my masters i have been miserable thissatisfied with my life. although i did well in terms of grades and references i was a reject because my name was ethic sounding not upper middle class fyi i am regular to lower middle class and commuted to school. also, i was a male while most of my peers were catty women. moreover, i was a social reject in most of undergrad except for my last year and i do not feel too prepared for professional world. i hated working retail and i really do not want to work in it or sales again at least not for more than months for retail . ideally i would like to work for the civil service but i am not confident in my ability to get hired. i have considered therapy in fact i might be able to see a psychiatrist through a connection who would put me at the front of the line public healthcare li amits but my problems sadness recurring mental breakdowns seem to be more connected to where i am at in life. it is getting really tough to function and i graduated with my masters in november classes finished in september . i can not finish a lot of tasks i set out to do and i hate who i am as a person. i have not felt too upbeat about life since high school and even when i like my life at points i just come crashing down mentally. i tried booking an appointment with my gp but although he was sympathetic and pleasant he seemed to think my symptoms were mild depression and suggested i see the social worker in his office. i know social workers have some training but he did not even mention how to book an appointment and never mentioned how to see a psychiatrist or psychologist or offered to give a referral. i would prefer to just ask another doctor for a referral but i live in a country with crap public healthcare so it is tough to find another doctor and i do not know if a new would be any good. it took me weeks to build up the courage to book that appointment and it did little for me. it did not help that i was doing well when i came in so i did not describe the worst of my symptoms. does not help that he did not ask enough about it though. also, if i wanted a referral to a specific psychiatrist how easy is that to get?? could i just book an appointment saying i wanted it or how would that work? if i wanted an aderrall or ritalin prescription how could i get that? i was hoping to get one the last ti ame i visited my gp specifically about having difficulty focusing and he just said it was probably mild depression. i procrastinated all the ti ame during my degrees but i did not mention it and i really need something to push me through and help me focus in life.	moderate

peculiar situation i have been in for a while i used to have many goals and want many things out of life love, friends, to have a career with some artistic body of work and that was when i felt most violently suicidally depressed. now i really do not have any goals or want anything but the well being of my cats, which they have. i now have no desire for friends, love, or to create and be a success. it does not even feel like depression because i do not really feel anything at all not bad and not good. i just feel normal, or what has been normal to me for some years now but when i take ti ame to get introspective about like right now i have to admit it is objectively hollow. my head feels empty and every now and then i realize that i have not thought about my own life in days, just politics and shit. i feel like i have failed to capture the crux of what i wanted to say here but yeah ulti amately i have been in a hollow empty unfeeling form of depression for some years now where i just coast and do not want anything and feel nothing. i relate to people less and less everyday and i realize that is objectively bad. and like i said, it does not even feel like depression because it is not depression as i knew it before where i felt a constant pain because i wanted certain things that i did not have. it, to me, feels like at some point i just gave up and settled in the hopelessness	moderate

the thissonance between what i know i can achieve and what i suspect is what makes me happy is extreme and debilitating my apologies if this comes off as self aggrandizing at ti ames and frankly i might have some comment history that would support that interpretation , i do not mean to spew egotistical nonsense, but i feel it is fair to say that i have had more success than most my age. i know i can achieve great things i have more than demonstrated that to myself, and seemingly everyone around me believes it and is wi willing to help me however i ask. i am an eagle scout with palms, i have a second dan black belt in taekwondo, i have a full ride merit based scholarship to my university, i am a second author on a published scientific paper and should be getting a second one soon, i have reason to believe that i might be receiving a prestigious national scholarship for research, and i am a project leader for a really cool project for a campus club. all of this while maintaining a nearly . gpa in both high school and college. i have been doing a lot of reflection lately as one might do when suffering from undiagnosed moderate, borderline severe clinical depression , and am beginning to wonder if at least one source of my depression is all the extra stuff i do beyond school. right now my depression is soul crushing, to the point that i hate the research i used to love, and can hardly self motivate myself to even play my favorite videogames let alone do things like be an effective leader for my club, or apply for a nationally competitive scholarship... yet somehow i am doing both . when i should be working on extracurriculars in my free ti ame, or could otherwise just be playing videogames, i am lying in bed doing basically nothing because literally nothing sounds like a good ti ame. i constantly feel like i am failing everything, especially at work, and tbh i think i am justified in feeling that way because i am fairly regularly dropping the ball at work and have come close elsewhere. it did not use to be this way. my freshman and first half of sophomore year were the best ti ames of my life. i had a ton of fun chi willing with friends, played some great videogames, got a . gpa in classes yes, my gpa has gone up during my depression , and began doing some really cool research with a nearby hospital. but beyond that, i was not doing anything. no college clubs, no scholarship award job applications, no extracurriculars. just getting home from classes and playing videogames in a room with of my closest friends from highschool who were then my dorm roommates our friendships all survived living together . then i think back to highschool, and although i would have never admitted it back then, i was nearly as depressed as i am now. this was back when i was earning eagle scout and becoming a tkd instructor, in addition to excelling in high school ap classes. although i am not yet sure it is a direct causal relationship and i know there are other factors to my depression, such as my relationship history or rather lack thereof , it sure is concerning looking back and realizing that the severity of my depression appears to directly correlate with my involvement in extracurricular activities of any kind. the thissonance between what i can achieve and what appears to make me happy is frightening to say the least. note i am seeking treatment from my university is psychiatric office but, i believe i am only ish weeks into a week wait list.	moderate
how much is too much to ask? so this is my second ti ame at the depression rodeo and i am crashing pretty bad, but i do not know how much help to ask for. i do not have a therapist at the moment i am working on it, on a waiting list but now medicated and taking steps to get out of the house and all that but i need support and i want to ask my friends for some. friends are not therapists, and i know this. frankly, i am terrified of treating my friends as therapists so i have a tendency to bottle things up until, surprise surprise, i am a mess and need to ask for help. i can, for the most part, function on my own. i get up, get dressed, drink my coffee, drive to school, etc on my own, but someti ames i just need someone to be there . not talking to me or having to give me physical contact or anything, just kind of exist in my vicinity. thing is, i know how odd it is to just ask someone to sit with you without making conversation, even if you re at a coffee shop or another chi will kind of place. to be honest, i do not have the energy to talk to others at the moment, but i am definitely an extrovert and i have learned i need the company of others to feel just a bit better, even if it is just for a short ti ame. i want to be invited along to places and to hang out with others i just do not want to be a soggy bag of beans that people take places because they feel obligated to, especially since the majority of my people ti ame is spent vacan notly staring into space trying to bring myself back into my body from thisassociation. a lot of the ti ame, i know it looks like i am in pain because i have a horrendous poker face, but i genuinely do enjoy being out with others, though i am well aware it does not look like i do most of the ti ame. do you think it is too much to ask my friends to just sit with me, doing homework or drinking coffee tea beverage of choice? if it is not, how do i ask friends for help without turning them into therapists? i do not want someone to listen to my sadness rants, i just want some company. any help is appreciated, thank you.	moderate
it seems like i can not be happy. a little backstory... i work jobs but i can not seem to get anywhere in life. i feel trapped. this week i worked well over hours. i do not think i will be able to pay all my bi wills. i want to go to uni but i can not find the ti ame. i thought that my life would be better when i got out of the military no longer working super long days having ti ame for a social life maybe meet someone but now it is worse. i am nearly at the end of my rope. i need to go to work tomorrow and i will be there for hours followed by another hours of working followed by another hours. i do not have ti ame to sleep. i do not have ti ame to read. i was trying to play board games with friends today but all i could think about was work and that my boss would yell at me again if i forgot something. i can not afford to take a day off. i am so lost.	moderate

here my story..kinda i was when my baby brother passed away. heres the thing i only found out i was three almost a couple years ago . which tbh shocked me cause no one ever talk to me about the situation but i have a strong memory with it. whole ordeal was violent. so it just stuck i guess. i feel guilty for even feeling bad about it. i was beaten and my dad at the ti ame i think he sexually abused me. i was adopted. i was hell to raise. no one understood why such small things would send me on a rampage. i feel so bad to anyone who was my friend. i was possessive. i was so toxic. i just didnt want to be lonely. i am sorry. i was bullied all through elementary to middle school. i had social anxiety it physical hurt my face felt like a thousand needles poking it and like someone lit me on fire.and on my grandmother theres no exaggeration there. and through high school i never learned how to love myself after all those years of bullying. i craving for love and wi willing to do anything for it. i have such unreasonable violent mood swings though it makes me feel so ugly. but i am sti will clingy as ever. tbh i think i want to get admitted to a hospital for a month atleast. i am not stable and also having delusional ideas. getting graphic here. but i am struggle so hard right now my emotions have full control. i am suffocating. i want release like self harm but it would be noticeable so i guess i can not. i have no solid friends cause of my behavior which makes sense i am happy they left and didntstick around with such a mess as me.....back to my emotions theres so black and white. dry or wet. up or down. and again such violent mood swings feels like two people in my body fighting each other. and i am just so tired so so soooooo tired. i want to know everything wi will be okay.i want to rest my thoughts. i am exhausted. i want to feel love. i wish i was never born.	moderate

i am in less than a month and hate myself woo boy this is a long fucking read strap in. i have dealt with depression my whole life. i was bullied quite literally every day from the start of kindergarten til i graduated. it made me fearful of people is intentions and paranoid someone is out to get me. the worst culprits were the drug dealer my age who put a hit out on me in th grade, the guy my age that beat the shit out of me just so he wouldn t have to go to art class in grade , and the girls exes and a scorned girl who i almost dated before this that tried to have me charged with false rape clai ams failed after months of investigation and the scorned girl coming clean to the police of the whole plot so they wouldn t have to see me at school in my grade year. this manifested in me removing people from my life over minor things to protect myself, constantly deleting social media accounts to start fresh at any sign of compromise, and thistancing myself from people for fear of them using my secrets against me. i made it through high school though. yay! except a year later my brother hung hi amself. it broke me. i sti will break down in secret every few weeks. no one knows. not even my girlfriend. i do not tell anyone anymore because it is been years and i should be over it . i have had brain injuries over years in the middle of my s that have taken most of my memories of my best years , a hernia surgery described to me by the surgeon as the worst case hes ever seen in someone my age, and the anxiety and trauma of everything has fucked me up. i have been diagnosed with minor agoraphobia, social anxiety thisorder, massive depressive thisorder, and now i am being tested for autism. i have not been able to hold a job for longer than a couple months in years because of all of this. i started school last summer, did a term, got kicked out for a term for health reasons, and now i am back in it but scared i wi will end up fucking up again. i am next month. i have a loving girlfriend of years who has been with me through some really dark ti ames. i have parents that would give me the world if they could. i have friends that truly care about me. i am not homeless or dying.... so why do i feel so alone? i hate myself. i hate everything i have done. i can not look at myself in the mirror anymore and i wonder how anyone can love me. i really needed to get this all off my chest. if you read it all, thanks and sorry for taking your ti ame to just bitch about myself.	moderate
i feel so lost right now.. a couple of months ago, i got evicted from my apartment. it was not really my fault, i had to deal with family medical issues. a friend of mine was going to be my roommate and gave me money for rent. we put everything in storage and i put everything i had on a down payment for a rent to own house. the financier tells me i need x the rent. so i stay with another friend and think that i wi will be able to do a partial payment instead of all of february. i call the guy today and he started the clock from the day i put money down. so he wants dollars tomorrow or no deal. i have half of that. i have no one to borrow from. i am ready to just end it.	moderate
never did i think this would happen. the past two years i have been in the best headspace i have ever been in regards to my mental health overall... i got a good job, accepted into university, found myself and became independant. i had been accepted to study abroad for a semester which has always been a dream of mine to travel to this particular country.. even better i have been able to live here for months instead of having a short visit. umm...... since arriving i have been overcome with depression insomnia and have barely attended classes at all.... i had other issues in the past that have sparked up since being here. now i only have month left and this feeling has stuck with me consistently. safe to say ruining my whole experience. not only has this life changing experience been the complete opposite of what i envisioned and hoped. i am completely aware that my depression wi will be an ongoing battle forever... before arriving here i thought i had overcome my depression due to my progress in the last two years. weird how i was doing so good back home and since being here everything is turned upside down for no reason i can truly identify. now i assumed it could have been because i am in a unfamiliar place, not close to loved ones, missing home etc. but to be honest coming overseas was perfect ti aming as back home i was frustrated and ready to get away and continue to i amprove my life. it is been a rude awakening and i am sti will unsure why this could be occurring when i was wanting and looking forward to the change.. and not necessarily missing home. i have papers due in weeks. i havent been able to concentrate and even begin. my family are expecting me to excel while here and i am ashamed of how i have deteriorated since being here. i am active, i know how to combat my depression in ways but its lingering like the m f it is. i am thisappointed in myself and know i have wasted an opportunity of a lifeti ame. tldr a lifeti ame experience opportunity has turned out to be nothing like i thought due to being struck by recuring bouts of depression for no identifiable reason.	moderate

need advice on my addiction and the underlying emotions that caused it should probably be posting this on r addiction but can not seem to get a response. to give some background i am m and have a physical and emotional dependency on weed. i have also dappled into shrooms and perscription adderall. first smoked when i was by myself and i ammediately fell in love with it. for a while it was an occasional thing maybe once every months but when i moved after my parents divorced things changed very quick. i moved in with the man my mom cheated on my dad with and that left me with alot of mixed emotions. my mom has the right intentions for me and my siblings, but she just can not seem to excecute them correctly. she is always on edge and she also is very controlling about what i look like and how i dress. on the other hand my dad is very caring but he has an extreme temper and had a past addiction of adderal and alcohol. so these emotions i had left me very depressed for a few months and i started smoking everyday ti ames a day so i could always have that euphoria that thistracted me from these emotions.and here i am now, currently going through withdraws because i ran out of weed. bottomline i just want to some advice on what i need to do at this point. is my brain permanently fucked? its been everyday for months now so i dont think theres a whole lot i can fix. 	moderate
feel like i am made a huge mistake i am almost , which feels like i am too old to be making this kind of dumbass decision. i am just starting in a job i already hate, and every night i get back from work i break down into tears, but not before getting right back into work since a lot of it is taking hours of work home with me right after a hour shift. i have a chronic i willness which has me needing a consistent nine to ten hours of sleep to stay in good health... so i have not had ti ame or motivation for any of my hobbies or my deep passions. on top of that, the work itself is exhausting on multiple levels. emotionally, physically my feet and head and chest ki will me at the end of every day. all the things that made life worth living feel bleak. even eating brings me no joy. i have lost pounds this month alone. i wear a smile and laugh and go through the motions but i feel like i am on the verge of cracking, and my face looks like skeletor more and more everyday. i hate my job and i feel like the ski wills here wi will never transfer to another profession, and that no one wi will ever hire me so that is why i had to take this job. other people in this field told me how they tried, and failed, to leave. they say, for all the sleepless nights and unpaid overti ame and premature balding, at least it wi will keep me financially stable. but at this point i am so stressed out i have considered hurting myself just so that i do not have to consider quitting vs potential homelessness and poverty. everyday i question why i sti will bother getting out of bed, and it is due to the fear of being a thisappointment to all the people who have supported my dumb ass through so much. i have never felt this low before in my life, and every night has me feeling ohysically pained from how stressed i am before work the next day. there is other small factors, but this job is sucking my life out of me. i feel too much guilt and pressure from family and peers to leave. i do not know if i deserve to be happy, to di what i always dreamed of, or if i should just suck it up and hope a car crushes me by accident one day. wi will i at least get an oppurtunity to be happy in retirement?	moderate
the things that hold me back a lot of the ti ame when depressed people talk about what holds them back from ending it all they talk about these things as being good, but i do not feel that way. i wish that the people in my life did not care about me. i wish i did not have responsibilities. i wish there was nothing and no one that relied on me. if that were true, then i would be free. i would be free to let it all go. to just die, and be away from the torture of life. i do not want to live, but i feel i have to.	moderate

do not do what you love for people that do not love what you do. depression has seriously been kicking my ass around the past month and a bit, so i thought it was ti ame to create a dedicated account to vent my worries. was a talented coder when i was younger, won national championships and so on. fast forward, health got the best of me and i ended up needing surgery or otherwise i would die. this went fine, and even got into uni on ti ame with the rest of my peers my age. ended up studying mathematics amp comp sci for a year before the rent became too much for someone that was doing freelance and i had to move home. in order to pay for uni locally, i started working. this job went shit with new management and they basically just used and abused me to make their systems government compliant so they could start taking on gov contracts. got poached about a month ago by a much larger company, which is a nice feeling. the part they do not tell you though, is that when they work you this hard, you burn out and end up hating everything you loved to do. i have no passion anymore, and my head constantly hurts. i am constantly dazing off and i have been feeling physically i will for the past months, but every doctor says it is nothing. so, as i sit here at work, constantly thinking of how i would love to jump out the window and end it all, just to be over with it. and knowing that i am going to go home just to sleep another hours just so i do not have to think about the depressing day i wi will have tomorrow, and knowing that i have nothing left that i like, that i have no motivation. i do not even care about the money anymore. i have had to drop out of university and leave the one last thing i loved doing, just so i can afford rent amp to feed myself. so with all that out of the way, for the younger ones about to enter the adult life, take this advice do not do what you love, if you are not working for yourself or for someone that does not love what you do. they wi will always end up stealing it from you, and that wi will make you hate it. you wi will be left with nothing. 	moderate

yea? ok good. well my good reader that is an easy answer. you read my title. i mean come on now. isnt my addiction to pain a good ass tittle? does that not grab your attention? sorry sorry. i get carried away someti ames. but anyways that answer to your question should be answered later on. and only by you. i can not answer that for you. i do not know why you read random stuff online or if this goes big then from a book store i do not know you! sorry again. i do not mean to yell. well my friend. i want you to ask yourself this second question. what does this title mean to me?

well my reader. from the good words of thomas shelby this addiction is in the past now. and the past is no longer my concern. actually he does not say it exactly like that but it is close enough to the point where if someone who is reading this saw the peaky blinders then they wi will know i totally ripped that off from the show and i do not want to be used. so better to be safe than sorry. and before i continue i want you to know something. i am not a writer. i suck at grammar, i probably would not use the correct words or proper paragraph styles. i am not an english teacher. shit the last ti ame i read a book to its entirety was back in highschool. and even then i used the fuck out of sparknotes to get through that class and at least have somewhat of an understanding of what i was reading. i am about to turn by the way at the ti ame i am writing this. so yeah. if there is any english major is reading this or teachers or just anyone who knows how to properly write a book or essay. please bear with me. i am going to be honest with you guys also. i do not know where to even begin. do i start from the very beginning? do i tell you guys how shaped up to be the worst year ever? or do i tell you about my most recent relationship with my ex girlfriend? i do not know yet. i am just winging this here. but whatever i choose to begin with, i really hope you guys stick around for the ride. and possibly enjoy it? no, this is going to be a depressing tale, or maybe it would not be. who knows? but i do hope this helps whoever needs it. whoever needs help to move forward in life like i am doing and understand why you re doing what you are. please enjoy. chapter a tale of dead romance so here goes. my last relationship was way over before i even knew it. i was with this girl for quite some ti ame and i didnt even know our relationship had already ended. what do i mean by that? well, she and i were at a rough spot for a while. constantly fighting constantly arguing over stupid things. but me being the idiot i was, i thought that was normal. you know? like every relationship they show on tv or have people tell you, you ll always argue with the significan not other. that is just life. that is normal . but i was a fool when it came to this. i didnt know she and i had already drew our last breath in this relationship. i didnt know she had already moved on and found someone else. i dont blame her. i really dont. she and i had been in a tight spot for a while. where she and i would argue almost every night over such stupid little things. it is funny to be honest. looking back now. those fights are kinda what i miss most now. because with every compromise she and i made i knew she cared. even if it was a little bit. maybe i should have been more supportive on her endeavors. maybe i should have been there for her. maybe i should have continued to monitor the situation and adapt to her to keep her. these are the thoughts that keep up at night. these are the reasons why i dont sleep. because i think about her every night. right now it is march th . we broke up on november th. on her birthday when i went to go and see her. yet i lie here awake at night not able to sleep thinking about what we could have been doing right now. what we could have been talking about. what we could have been planning. not a day has gone by where i have not thought about her... i promise you reader this has never ever been me. i was never one to be like this. sure i have always been lonely. i have actually always liked being alone. to be in my own bubble. away from society and family. just on my own. but nowadays... while i sti will crave to be alone in my thoughts i get upset because i know theres no one thinking of me. i know that at night i wi will not be able to sleep with someone on the phone or have a night call with. you may be telling yourself well why dont you find someone else to do all those things with? . it is just not that si ample. i got torn down when she and i broke up. i became someone i didnt even recognize anymore. when i look in the mirror i do not even see myself anymore. i see a lost soul looking for something that is out of my grasp out of my understanding. out of my comprehension of what i am feeling right now. have you ever felt this pain?

does anyone else just feel beyond help? every last piece of advice i have gotten related to my situation is something i can not put into practice. focus on hobbies i do not have any. chase what makes you happy nothing does. spend more ti ame with friends i have like , and i do not want to bother them for fear that they wi will abandon me if they realize how deeply broken i am. eat healthier i do not have the energy required to cook all the ti ame. try to change the way you think about things literally how? i just feel like a lost cause.	moderate

i just randomly sprouted depression and i do not know what to do i am a yo type one diabetic who has delt with my parent divorce who has been pretty happy for my whole life. even during the divorce i was not super miserable. but ever since last month i have been really in motivated, sad, and depressed. it is getting really bad, kinda suicidal, just really self loathing. i do not know how or why this is happening, and just wanted to vent to strangers on the internet. thanks for reading	moderate
wi will i ever feel whole? i do not feel like i have a right to be depressed. i know that is not how depression works and it is not some badge of honor, but i feel guilty for being depressed. i am successful in most aspects of my life. i have a good paying job at that i am doing well in and have real career prospects. i have both deep friendships with a large group of guys who live on the opposite side of the country and strong friendships in the new city i live in. i am not doing too poorly socially, if i need someone to hang out with or go on a date. loving family with a thistinct lack of any traumatic events growing up. when i set goals, i usually end up achieving them. i have developed some interesting and diverse hobbies. why is it never enough? my dream is to be a good father and husband to my family. but i am afraid that it sti will would not be enough. i wi will sti will feel lonely when i am with my family and friends. i am a stupid romantic so i fool myself into believing i wi will find someone who ll take away that loneliness. but i know that is not a fair thing to put on someone and somehow i am supposed to solve it. my chronic depressive episodes are short enough that i have never considered going to a therapist or going on antidepressants. i do not even know if antidepressants would have an effect. tl dr more or less perfect life on paper, sti will feel alone. anyone dealing with something si amilar? any advice, thoughts, etc?	moderate
who else has zero emotional motor ? there is nothing at all in life that is worth doing. i want nothing. i find so little flavor in any day to day activity. there is nothing forcing me to learn new things and there are exactly zero people i want to meet, and zero ways to make me happy. i genuinely think every wholesome part of my personality just died a few years ago. like my inner child is not there anymore.	moderate

depression and death do not feel bad that you are sad when others see you have the perfect life . depression is not because your life sucks depression is medical and it is about yourself. you could have the perfect life and be on top of the world but do you like yourself and do you want to live? i do not talk about anything anymore because i am tired of people pulling the others have it worse card. it is not about the life i am living it is about what is happening in my head that makes me want to paint the curtains red	moderate

anyone else wish they could fall into a coma? i do not like life very much right now. there is a lot of problems i have which have no real possible answer, and my favorite thing to do is sleep because it numbs my brain from stuff like this. i do not want to ki will myself, i do not want to cause any thistress like that to my family, so i wish i could just slip into a coma one way or another. i just need, any sort of extended break from reality, holy fuck. sleep is a nice break, but it does not last long at all. i am only i do not have it nearly as bad as most others here do, i apologize. but just, nothing feels special about life anymore. things are kind of difficult now, but looking at the future, it only looks like things are going to get even more difficult, and that is something i wish i could veer away from, but it does not look like that is within my power. i do not want to die, i am scared of finding out what is on the other side, but stuff like sleep and comas are pretty much as close as one can get to being dead without actually dying as far as i am aware. thanks for reading my vent, i hope you have a great day.	moderate
trying to make myself feel better is always the hardest part. starting this by apologizing if some sentences run on for too long. my sentence structure gets really shit when i word dump. the people that i am able to feel like are my friends always commend me for being so positive towards them all and helping when i can, and i have a strong wi will to help others. but when it comes to myself it is like everything i stand for is just gone. i recently had to move last year and it made me lose my best friends for years to a hour thistance. my parents have a back and forth relationship where they both want to be together for me and my siblings but the two things they can never agree on is money work and how to best take care of their kids so their back and forth arguing and my father being in and out the house just makes every other week awful. ever since i came to this school i had one year where i was overly lonely and broke down on the drive home in front of my parents because i could not make any real friends. i never go to any events because nothing about this school feels right for me to go to them. hell i am having issues doing the last few things required to graduate. but it is like i just stay in my room almost every day because i have nothing else to do and no one to talk to, i am able to tell others how they have a great future ahead of them as long as they keep their head up but every ti ame i am met with a roadblock all i think about is how i have become a thisappointing son as the oldest child in my family and i am a bad role model for my youngest sibling. and that at some point both my parents wi will finally clue one that i really might not be going anywhere. i have my moments of aspiration but they leave just as fast and i am back at square one where i can not find any resolve to want to leave my room. i know that i need to have the strong wi will to beat the bad thoughts away but it is hard because i feel like there is no person who really sees me as their favourite or the person they always want to check up with and see if they are ok. my friends know that my life is not great, just that i am usually positive. i just want the subconscious feeling that someone else i know personally thinks about me and hopes i am okay rather than me only occasionally popping in and out of their mind as the oh yeah, he is pretty cool. but i never want to ask someone a question like that because it just feels like they wi will do it but only because they have been prompted to. leaving me feeling like they do it more so out of moral necessity than me just being someone they actually care for very much. i never know how to phrase these things because whenever i type shit like this i usually delete the draft just thinking that i wi will be seen as overly needy and maybe i am, but someti ames i just want to be able to think i have someone close to me that really does want to make sure that i am doing ok, or have the feeling that i am someone is favourite out there and not the one who is just slightly average at everything and is not anyone is actual first choice.	moderate

never been to therapy but want to i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for about years now yo and would most likely benefit from therapy. i do not like to self diagnose but i am about positive i would be diagnosed with depression, gad, and ocd and potential other things i do not know as much about. while i have been think about going for years and my issues are only getting worse for some reason i can not get myself to go. i literally have nobody to talk to about these things and have never told anyone about these issues either. i have so much i want to talk about but i can not commit to going. i have this deep feeling that my problems are not valid and i think that is why i have problems reaching out for help. has anyone else been in a si amilar situation and went to therapy? how did it go?	moderate
i do not know what normal is supposed to feel like. i spent the last decade on opiates, most of that on methadone. i have been off them for over a month now, with the help of some comfort meds to ease the withdrawals. the worst of that is over, but now the depression is starting to kick in, and hard. i do not know if i have always been this way, my arms and legs are scarred to hell from cutting when i was younger. i have been hospitalized for a suicide attempt once over stress at school. i remember struggling with depression, hallucinations and anxiety as a teenager, but everything after the opiates is a blur of diagnoses and medications. and i do not know what was caused by the drugs or what was actually wrong with me. but this ti ame it is different. i have no motivation. i spent the weekend staring at my phone screen, did not even have the energy to pick up the tv remote. random crying spells. anger and stress over the si amplest things. all the things i used to love to do, even though i would like to do them, i just can not bring myself to actually do. everything i do seems pointless, it is an endless repeating cycle. i do not see the point in living. i have a husband and pets that i care about, but that is the only thing keeping me going at this point. does anyone here have experience with depression after stopping opiates? i knew it could happen, i just do not know if this is just more withdrawal symptoms or if i am actually falling back into a major depressive episode. my next appointment with my psych is a month away, the rational side of me is telling me to call and reschedule for sooner. i would prefer not to spend another week in a psych ward if i can avoid it, and it feels like i am heading that direction again.	moderate
good evening hey everyone, i am writing pretty much to get things off my chest. i do not really know what to say so this wi will all seem a bit rambly so please bare with me. so, i am depressed and probably suicidal i say probably because dealing with absolutes is scary. anyways, i can not really turn to a therapist since the career i am going to school for requires me to have never been forcefully hospitalized for mental issues. so here i am typing things out to a bunch of strangers when i should be trying to sleep. i thought about ki willing myself tonight. had a gun to my head and was about a third of the way through pulling the trigger when i finally gave up. i called myself dramatic and beat myself up a bit for the admittedly low point. this is not even close to the first ti ame i have done this either. i went on my first date since my ex and i broke up. usually i have my ever faithful shield of pessi amism to keep me from getting too hurt but this ti ame seemed to be going well and i thought for once i was good enough and that i did something right. and then this morning i was blocked on everything so.. yeah that stung. and i do not really have many friends to lean on either so every crisis, every sleepless night, every maybe tonight is the night where i shut it all off is handled by me and me alomne. i do have friends mind you or, rather i think i do. i do not really know. every ti ame i reach out they are too busy or are finally just fed up with talking to me. i am sorry if i am going on too long thank you to anyone who has hung in there with me. anyways i should probably rest. thank you and have a lovely evening.	moderate
how do you find a job when you re depressed? i have been at my current job for years now and i hate it. i am lucky in the sense that i have managed to sti will show up everyday and not get myself fired or quit on a whi am. i used to really like my job and had a great sense of pride in the work i do. it is mostly a boring job, nothing special, but i am really good at it. i spend a lot of ti ame by myself, which i like but i have always had to pick up my coworkers slack, never get much recognition for my work, have to do a lot of my bosses tasks that i should not have to do while he gets the credit for it, etc. and then, the past year, my boss is boss has i amplied more than once that i am overpaid for what i do while cutting my hours intermittently while business has been slow then giving me extra hours when it is busy. i should have left a while ago, i know. i started looking for a new job a couple months ago. i have applied to about places and have only gotten interview. i have been applying to si amilar jobs to the one i have right now with the same salary, someti ames a little more, someti ames a little less. i feel like i should be getting more call backs than i have. the interview i had, i thought i was the prefect fit! when i did not hear anything back, i thought they must have found someone more experienced or had a degree i do not have one. but after weeks from my interview, i saw they refreshed the job ad online. i feel like my job has really negatively affected my mental health and my self esteem is pretty non existent now. job hunting has only been making it worse and i know i have to really put more effort in if i am going to find something but it just seems i ampossible at this point. i am starting to believe that i am overpaid and do not have anything good to offer to a potential employer in the field i am trying to work in, and it just makes me feel worthless. how do you find a job when you re depressed?	moderate

suicide hey! alright, i am not going to hold you back since you re probably sitting down right now and complementing suicide before i start, take a deep breath and relax. i have had family, friends or strangers that i have met take their lives. it is no joke and its something to take seriously. though, someti ames.. we can not anymore, we have given our best every day and we get nothing back in return and whats the point if there is no reward. well, there is a point. the point to show everyone that even in the darkest places, you are the one that stood up and showed everyone that was doubting you that you could take the hits. you could do it. most people that take their lives believe that nobody cares. if nobody truly cared, then nobody would find your body and report it. if nobody truly cared, then nobody would be at your funeral. again, most people that take their lives believe that there is no affect. they are wrong. if you look at those who have had a loved one take their life, then they wi will they you that there is a domino affect to this action. if you take your life, then close ones wi will be questioning themselves and trying to find out what they did wrong the rest of their life, and that ends them up in the gutter and it just drags on. the point is, there is a reason to live and for the goddamn sake of my mentality, dont take your life because i care about you. i may not be able to see you through the screen, but trust me, and that is all i ask of you. if you feel like you are going to do something thisastrous, pm me or comment so i can pm you. if you dont want to sit there for hours and hear me rant talk about random things, then call the suicide hotline .	moderate

i am scared of being alone? i have always been boy crazy . i have not been single since i was in middle school college now and it has always added some type of happiness to my life. i guess having someone other than my family, love me made me happy. i have not had a best friend since i was and no one cares about me the way i care about people. i wi will go above and beyond to make others happy even a little but i never seem to i ampact anyone is life. it is like, if i am there, it is okay but if i am not, it wouldn t matter. and it hurts because i know the presence of other people matters. my point is, my happiness has always depended on having a boy loving me. it fi willed me with joy and happiness to know someone loved me so much and needed me in their life. and anyti ame i have an issue with my current boyfriend, it fi wills me with such anxiety and depression. am i stupid for feeling this way? last night i cut myself for the first ti ame in almost a year. and it was over hi am. i wanted to end it. i keep telling myself i am not like this because of a boy, but i am and that is something i would never admit to anyone but people on the internet who wi will never know me. i am scared of being alone and i wish i was enough for myself. i wish my own presence was enough for me. everyone says i need to learn to be happy alone and i try so hard. days without my boyfriend seem okay but then they are not. i do not even know if he is my boyfriend. we have had so many issues and my depression came back because of how bad my relationship with hi am was going. i am seeing a therapist psychiatrist right now and they both kind of agreed that i was depressed because of this boy and they kind of made it seem like it was stupid. and it is. but it hurts me so much that i feel this way. i feel so lost and alone and i have no energy to go on. it is like my happiness is directly correlated with how well my relationship w a boy is going. i hate myself for being this way. he is even said it before, that i am scared of being alone. it is true. i think. i do not know anymore. i feel so stupid about everything. i do not want to be here anymore.	moderate

questioning myself i asked myself everyday. why do i get hurt all the ti ame by the person that i love? i asked myself why would they hurt me while i tried my best to give them to make their life easier. i am feeling so down tonight. i wish i know why? why do i keep on feeling that i am not good enough even though i have done so much for the people that i love. why would my exes cheated on me? why do they keep on living me stranded, alone and hurt. it is my responsibility to heal myself from my trauma. but i can not do it on my own when someone that said they love me just hurting me with their words and actions. i asked myself, am i that terrible? am i not that worthy? am i not good enough? why? this feeling that i felt right now feels like that i just wanted to be thisappeared from life. but in some way, i should stay alive for people who need me. when someone hurt you so much, why do i feel that i am not enough? that i am not worthy. that i am not good enough for them, specially that one person that you thought that they wi will be the person that you can count on, to that person that promise you that he wi will takecare of you, to that person that promise that he love you? do i really deserve this? what have i done that i deserve to be treated badly? what have i done that i deserve not to be love unconditional? i do not feel love from that people who said they love me. the unconditionally love that i have so far are from people that are friends. other than that, it is a conditional love. a love that they give because they need me in their life to help them feel good about themselves, to support them financial, to give them comfort, to make sure that wi will always be love. i am so depress that why i do keep on failing in my love and relationship life with the person that i care about? why would they hurt me so much? i wish they wi will not love me and just leave me and not make a move if they know that are not really true. instead of making me have hope, but in the end it is just a fake hope because they do not truly love.	moderate

it is probably common i know things could be worse but i sti will have such a hard ti ame with keeping up on hygiene. showering seems like such a big deal. i hate how hard it seems. i have a hard ti ame eating too. i have to force myself to. i have chronic pain, due to medical bi wills i am filing for bankruptcy, i had seizures so i have to take keppra to be able to drive and it fucking causes depression and suicidal thoughts. i am on an anti depressant too. so that is my situation. it is just nice to vent to people who get it. i am starting counseling.	moderate
anyone struggling might find this helpful, so here it is no theory or clai am in this letter is based on scientific fact or has been in any way proven. the theories presented are of my own creation and have not been tested in any way. as an individual struggling with depression, the search for happiness has gone hand in hand with a search for survival. strugglers of serious depression spend their whole lives in search of happiness. depression is a journey for happiness, unique to each individual. one main misconception about curing depression is that other people know how to guide you on your journey. happiness does not have a formula. any doctor that clai ams to have a method for curing depression is a waste of your ti ame. many non depressed people hold individuals to societal standards and if individuals meet these standards and are depressed, people look at them and wonder why. i am not an exception. i attend a prestigious university, am very financially support by very well off parent, have never had to worry about any basic human needs, have tons of friends, a girlfriend, and i am doing well in school. but i also sat on my be also nightly with a knife to my wrist edging ever so close to choosing the easy way out. i cry myself to sleep every night out of self loathing and when i wake up, my first thought of the day is is this going to be my last day? naturally, given my well off parents, i received every treatment therapy you could i amagine in my quest to shake my depression. none of it had any effect. i continued down the path of following recommendations and such on the internet and from professionals that path drove me deeper and deeper into depression. my depression got to the point where i was not even sure if i liked my intermediate family anymore. one day, i snapped. i just left. not for long, only about hours, but in those hours, i learned more about the way life works than i had in my previous years. in those hours i learned the most crucial lesson anyone could teach you you know what is best for you and you alone can best medicate your mind. when it comes to your physical health, it is best to leave it to the professionals. this is because anatomically, most bodies are the same. they are made up of the same stuff and operate virtually the same way regardless of the human. but this is the exact opposite for the brain. every brain on planet earth is thistinct and unique. i would describe the brain using the theory. of the human brain is a result of evolution. we all have the same survival instincts and si amilar traits that have resulted in humans arriving where they are today. this area of the brain allows us to converse, eat, sleep, and do everything normal humans do. your is what makes you human. however, it is the of the brain where you find uniqueness among individuals. your is who you are, what separates you from other humans. ideally, individuals wi will let their loose and really express who they are. this is unfortunately very far from reality. as i have pointed out and wi will continue to, society is not good for the individual. society is a competition for materialistic things in order to prove you are better than someone. due to the competitive side that exists in the , societal expectations take control over your , hindering you from truly being you. more on the process of taking control of your below. i am sti will developing my craft as a writer and could not find a great way to transition to this paragraph, so here is a really awkward and out of place sentence. social classes have certain expectations within that class and you are considered a failure in some respects if you do not meet these expectations. for the son of an upper class white male such as myself, the expectations look somewhat like this go to college, graduate, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, retire early because you are wealthy. it did not occur to me until my sophomore year i had been dealing with depression for multiple years at this point of college what if i do not want to meet these expectations? for some this is going to be a lot harder than for others. accepting that you no longer want to fit into these societal expectations wi will often be met with judgment and criticism from the people you thought were your closest friends, someti ames even family. i understand more than most just trying to fit in in order to feel good about yourself, but i promise you that once you pursue what you are genuinely passionate and excited about, you would not care about other peoples opinions of you. the people who truly care about you wi will stay by your side regardless of how you live your life. it is my belief that depression is somewhat systematic, meaning the society we live in promotes unhealthy standards of living leading to an increase in depression in younger people. take the risk to be your own person. own your . the big takeaways good happy happiness are all relative terms. just because something makes you happy, does not mean it wi will make someone else happy. this one is more directed at parents. i understand that if the child is younger it is your responsibility to raise your kid as you see fit i am not a parent and am in no way trying to give parenting advise . that being said, once your kid reaches around college age, as i have, they are old enough to start formulating their own decisions. if your child has been depressed over the past couple of years and you play a big role in their life, as hard as it is to do, you need to step back and allow your kid to pursue what he she wants to pursue, not what you want hi am her to pursue or what you think he she should pursue. i am not saying step completely out of his her life, but as your child matures, it is i amportant to take more of an advisor type role. as tough as it might be to watch your kid fail, we need to learn from our mistakes and learn from them. you know what is best for you. do not be afraid to pursue what you love to do. own your . again, this letter is from personal experience and everything said does not necessarily apply to everyone, or anyone for that matter. i have struggled through depression and feel like sharing this experience could potentially help out other individuals, so here it is. any questions, feel free to comment!	moderate

is it irresponsible to have a relationship and kids if the depression runs in the family let me start by giving a little context. my family is not the most mentally stable family out there. my father and his siblings all exhibited some form of mental i willnesses. my aunt is diagnosed with bipolar thisorder. although my dad always refused to see a professional, he shows clear signs of depression i can not tell the degree . my mom had seen a professional before and was diagnosed with major depression. me and my brother did not fall far from the tree either. my brother has shown the signs of apathy and he has been diagnosed with various degrees of depression. i have been experiencing depression in episodes. by now, i am familiar enough with the depression that i developed my own coping mechanisms. so far it has been pretty manageable. i have a fairly decent job, social circle etc. and i function to an acceptable degree although maintaining these despite the depression someti ames feels like a chore and a half... the problem is i can not form inti amate and meaningful relationships with others. i had s.os before and our relationship always suffered from my episodic depression. now, every ti ame there is a spark with someone, i feel like i should not pursue it as i do not want to put the burden of my thisability seriously it feels like living with a thisability by now on them. it is not obvious that i regularly suffer from depression and i feel like it is not their problem to deal with. also having a family history of mental i willness kinda makes me wonder if it is a good idea to have a family of my own. if this thing really runs in the family, i would be dooming my kids to a broken life which they did not choose. is there anyone feel like this?	moderate
stuck in a rut i can not get out of i do not like to be negative, i feel like it just brings others down, but someti ames i just need to say how i feel and ehat i am going through. i am having difficulty functioning each day. i do not work because i was injured at work and left with a permanent injury. my husband goes to work at his mini amum wage job with our only car and so i am left all alone. i do not have any family nearby. i do not have any friends here either, we recently moved from out of state. i just feel all alone and like life is pointless. we had to leave most of our stuff behind to move. i do not have any comforts like a tv, washing machine and dryer, couch, dresser, etc. i bought a tv second hand at a thrift store for dollars . i tested it at the thrift store and it worked. after i got home, i plugged it in and it would not power on. the thrift store has a strict no refunds or exchanges policy. money is tight, so i can not go buy another one. all i can figure out to do with my ti ame is read books or go online on my phone luckily my apartment has free internet . someti ames i do a bit of coloring in adult coloring books, but i can only do so much coloring or scrolling online or other things that use my hands arms because i have severe nerve damage in them. i can not do most hobbies other people enjoy due to the problems in my arms. i have little room to do any kind of exercise in my apartment. i have anxiety to go outside because i would have to be on foot, and i know little about this new town and i have anxiety about cri ame, the covid virus goung around, etc, and i have next to no money to spend anywhere. there is not much within walking thistance, no buses around, etc. we have a cat, but she kind of likes to do her own thing. family works, has kids, etc and does not have much ti ame to talk to me on the phone. i just feel so alone all the ti ame, and like i have nothing to do with my ti ame, and like my life is pointless. i can not volunteer because my thisability pay does not allow it. i often find myself sleeping a lot to pass the ti ame. i can not have children because i am infertile. i also can not do ivf because it is highly advised against because it may make my small brain tumor grow bigger. i just wish i had more things to occupy my ti ame. i do not know what to do. i have depression, anxiety, and ptsd. i am on medication, which helps, but life is just pretty meaningless when you always have nothing to do. someti ames i do meditation, but i get bored of it. i get bored of everything because i have little to do with my ti ame. i am just hoping my situation wi will change, but i think it wi will take a long ti ame. any suggestions of what to do in the mean ti ame?	moderate
i feel so uni amportant. i do not trust mental health services. too many ti ames have i been burned by them. i have been trying to get a psychiatric assessment for months, due to me believing i may have bpd in addition to depression. no luck. i have been referred places, sure, but everyti ame, they turn me away for either being too severe or too mild of a case. my favourite line is when they say, sorry, this is an emergency clinic, so we have to turn you away. because at this exact moment i am not going to ki will myself. i was so happy to finally see even a nurse after pulling tooth and nail to get somewhere, only for her to tell me to keep up the good work and wait for spots to open up on a program that has no waitlist, is the only one of its kind in the city, and does not tell people when they have open spots. so, i would get better service if i tried to ki will myself. people only really care when you re at death is door.	moderate
i think i am ready and i just want to leave. i have no ambitions or dreams. i am always losing friends, left and right. my parents do not understand me. i am tired of hearing just go to psychiatrist and get some anti depressants, as if doping myself up every day wi will help with the actual problem that is my mind. i can not have anything good for myself, because i fuck everything up. i try to be positive, but i always feel my depression over my shoulder and just shitting on everything i want to believe in. people always say you re beautiful, you make friends so easy, but i feel like the ugliest and fattest person i know. i never come first to anyone, and nobody ever really understands just how painful it is to live with depression. it is not the same for everyone. for me, it is literally like i want to go to japan, and then i ammediately after i remember my lack of stable income and my mountain of student debt also, no degree, a three ti ame drop out because i was always breaking down. someti ames it is i want to maybe fall in love, and then i hear this voice, thistorted but my own, calling me an idiot and saying that no one wi will ever want me, you re thisgusting and unstable, you need to lose pounds and maybe you ll be decent. do people really not understand the idea of your depression being you vs. every single one of insecurities on the most poisonous and obnoxious levels at all ti ames? so much so that it becomes i ampossible to shut it out? i can not handle being alone either. i stare at my phone and realize i only have two people who are there for me, which is more than most. but i can not help but feel like i am a burden, always. it would be easier if their emo ass friend just thisappeared. i have been feeling scared lately because .... all of my memories are mostly bad. everything has been tarnished by my depression, one way or the other. i just can not live day to day, trying to suppress tears every few hours. the idea of dying lately has brought a sense of calm to me, and that is how i know i am at the edge. i just want it all to stop. i want to be a different person. i want to be normal. but instead i am me, and someti ames i look in the mirror and just want to throw up. i truly do hate myself and i really, really hope i can make the decision to take my own life soon. i keep thinking about how i would like to die, and it soothes me. i do not know if i want to overdose because i could always fuck up. i do not want to jump because haha i am afraid of heights and the spectacle. lately, i have been considering carbon monoxide poisoning because i have heard it is painless. i am already considering my methods of how take my own life and that is how i know i am ready.	moderate

how i know that it is getting bad again i wrote this in early december, nothing has changed since then but i thought i would share this hoping someone can relate. you wake up the next morning, hoping the pain from last night is not lasting. the moment you open your eyes you finally realize. it all strucks you at once, it is like a dark hole that is sucking you up but your trapped. you can not get out of this dark hole, you keep trying to get up but all you can see is blackness. you turn to wake up but your head keeps telling you just a little longer. you just think your tired. you finally get up forcing yourself to go on with your day. you may have slept in hoping sleeping might somehow make it go away. it strikes you again, you feel powerless. everything you can ever think of makes you sad, all you can see is the negative. your brain is stuck on the intrusive thoughts of sucicde, death, hopelessness, loneliness, unworthiness. every little thing makes you angry, and upset. all you want to do is just sit there and cry. soon this feeling wi will repeat, and repeat, and repeat. it would not stop repeating, but somehow you go numb to the feeling. you accept it. you stop going out, you stop doing anything. everything that ever mattered to you just thisappears. the only thing that matters is dying and the blood that manifests in my arms. you cry until you can not feel much longer, you cut until there is no more space left on both of your arms. depression sickness me but all i can do is say i am okay. you can not reach out because no one understands. it feels as if you re crazy, maybe even insane. you beg for help because all you want to do is die but deep down inside you know you want to stay alive. depression finally passes. it leaves you fucked, you can not stop thinking about it. it is as if you miss it. you want it back, you miss the feelings but somehow you mangaged to go numb from them. you sti will want to die, just not as bad. you sti will want to cry, but not as bad. soon you relapse again, i have many ti ames. they tell you it gets better, they tell you people care, they tell you mental i willness matters, but when you say something about it no one seems to ever care. you may not be able to see my depression, there is no physical signs. there is no fever, runny nose, however it is sti will there rather you see it or not. soon you get addicted to anything, anyone who can make this horriblely terrible feeling somehow go away. addiction happens, you ll do anything for a get away. drugs makes you finally feel. however you need to quit. you need to stop stalling and get help. drugs does not numb it forever. the feelings do come back no matter what. every ti ame something good happens all i do is sigh. i never expect any good things. i hate my life and i have surely accepted that the universe is against me.	moderate

why do i feel so awkward and sad after sex? this guy friend of mine and i had sex a couple hours ago. during the act i am happy and having a good ti ame and all that. however afterward i just feel so awkward and guilty. he has a collection of shot glasses he travels for work and always gets one from all the places he visits . i told hi am that instead of cumming in the condom he should cum in a shot glass. so i put a shot glass between my boobs and he came in it and i drank it lol. it is not the first ti ame i had sex with hi am but i just feel so awkward and weird especially the whole shot glass thing. after we were done we laid in his bed and we kissed and he told me that he loves me then he fell asleep. we have always jokingly said i love you to each other but i am not sure what love he means anymore. we are both in our late twenties.	not depression
just lost my uncle. completely devastated my uncle, larry just passed away due to a sudden cardiac arrest a few hours ago. i am completely devastated when got the call from my parents, and i feel so guilty that i could not fly back for the funeral since he is back in ireland and i am in the us. hearing my dad cry is just so heartbreaking, he was such a genuine and caring lad and he would make everyone laugh. he was more than an uncle to me, he was my brother, my teacher. my girlfriend also dumped me a few days ago for no reason. i am in complete despair. life seems meaningless. i pray everyday and they are never answered. i am ugly and wi will never find love. i try so hard to be happier, opti amistic, and i am tired of putting on this facade of being happy and cheerful. i really can not see the light anymore. i am sorry.	not depression

why does being an introvert have to be a thing? too shy to talk to people, especially women. no confidence. quiet and higher pitched voice. hate being alone but gets uncomfortable in highly social situations. i would give anything to be one of these people that can just talk to a random stranger. i hate being this way. it is why i ended up a dystheist misotheist.	not depression

any healthcare medical workers out there? i have been in this field for almost years. i am starting to question whether this is the best field for me and my mental health. granted, i had depression and anxiety from before i was in this field so i know this is not the sole cause. but i can not help but wonder if i would be happier with a job that did not give me as much stress and was not so demanding. is it the job itself? is it the amount of hours i work? or is it just me? i love my job. i help people. it makes me feel fulfi willed. but i wouldn t say it is my ideal job. am i just blaming my job for my unhappiness? has anyone left the healthcare field? all advice and comments are welcome. 	not depression

so.. this is what is going on with me.. so when this started, i had a healthy social life, i was in pretty good shape amp had quite a few options ahead of me. a solid job that had me making a decent living amp was just a pretty well rounded person. amp now.. well.. i met my girlfriend on tinder in . it was not like most matches, she was cute, caring amp a real pleasure to talk to. i did not have a car at the ti ame, so as a year old man, i had my mom drive me to her f at the ti ame parents house so she could come spend the weekend with me amp with our parents meeting i ammediately it set the bar for the future to be laid out easier.. the spark was i ammediate and i had not felt like this about anyone in years.. passion, love, need. all in weeks.. the next week she drove back to see me, all the same phases were repeated.. she was the one.. she moved in week later, fast i know.. but being young ish, we did not care. fast forward months of a perfectly balanced wonderful relationship. i tear my shoulder up at work pretty badly, was out of work for months.. then when i tried to go back to my job, they said i did not go through the proper channels amp that i abandoned my job and wouldn t let me come back.. even after years of dedicated service. it sent me into a spiral of depression amp anxiety to the likes of me having to take medication now.. my one bright spot through it all has always been her.. i went without work for a year and a half.. giving up someti ames, getting turned down for easy positions amp getting more depressed, but she stuck with me through all of the bad.. there were fights, but we always made up.. about months ago we moved in with one of my best friends in ny we re from oh and it turned ugly with hi am quick. so in the process of the stresses involved with the move to a new state then back in with my mom our relationship took a big blow.. i was without work but dedicated myself to finding a job. as soon as we moved back i found a job. it was going great but being out of work so long, the activity i was doing caused a severe infection in my foot after a blister burst during a night of work. i called off one night to go to the er amp was fired days later.. more depression ensued.. but sti will she stayed.. months ago, my landlord offered me a job at a pizza place he owns... i did not want it.. at all, but to better my life amp our relationship i took it and have been there since. busting my ass for bad pay but sti will making enough to provide for my family. seems like things are looking up for me, right? well tonight hours ago to be exact, after a terrible day night at work i walk into my bedroom amp see a statue of a woman.. i ask if she is okay.. she says yes, but i can see in her eyes this is not the case. i push because i care amp i want to right any wrong that has happened to her. she stares.. i say you want to break up do not you .. she tells me to sit down. we have been talking for hours.. but she says it is not me.. it is her.. she never took ti ame to be a single adult amp work on herself amp i am a crutch that she feels terrible about using.. so she is leaving.. the ambition came from nowhere, and while i am proud she is taking life more seriously, the fact that she is leaving me to do so is ki willing me inside.. i feel like it is not real.. like.. i am watching it happen to someone else.. but as i have helped separate our things for the last hours, i am spiraling into depression again. i took a xanax to calm my anxiety so i did not full on break down.. but i do not feel right and part of me is afraid i would not ever feel alright again. i do not even know why i am writing this.. i just relived my past and a half years in minutes of typing on a phone and now my heart hurts.. my stomach hurts.. my mind is racing.. what do i do now.. we we re planning on getting married.. now i would not even feel the pressure of her side of the bed anymore.. she would not be there for me when i need her to keep my head from falling off.. i can not say hey babydoll amp have her ask what is up with a big smile on her face... i can not i amagine falling asleep without her.. and now i am going to have to do it every night.. i hate this.. i hate me.. i am lost. forgive me if this is a rambling mess.. but that is pretty much what i am at this point.. a mess.	not depression

working a to job depresses me i can not live like this anymore. my life is not mine. everyti ame i think about going to work my depression makes me unable to think and move. my depression is not some vague thisease with a biological cause. my life circumstances cause it. i just want to be free. i do not want to work my entire life for someone else. i want to live. i have always hated to be controlled. i hate to have my life taken away from me. nothing is sick about that. i have to work so much and then i spent my money on rent and food. it is like i am just keeping myself barely alive so that other people can benefit from my labour. i do not want to waste my youth with a to job. this can not be everything. this should not be everything. i just see no point in living if i do not live for myself. and retirement is a fucking scam. i am so done with this bullshit lmao	not depression

having a bfrb is not quirky it is debilitating. i am typing this post with one hand right now, the other is in my mouth as i bite down on my own skin making it bleed. not fun right? well to some people they like to pretend it is a quirky personality trait. i know it is hurting me and i do not want to hurt myself like this but it is something i can not avoid. i have a range of different bfrbs including, dermatophagia, trichoti willomania and dermati willomania. dermatophagia skin biting trichoti willomania the urge to pull out hair from different areas of the body dermati willomania urge to pick skin these are the basics of what mine are. many people are not educated on the i willnesses. i was not either until a few years ago when i came across an article on quora. my symptoms instantly matched and i was finally able to understand my strange behaviours that i have had as long as i can remember. my problem here is that people treat it as a joke and think it is cool to fake. yeah it is super call that i do not wear my hair down in case i have a bald patch or have an easier way to pull out my hair. it is super cool to pull out your eyelashes to the point that your eyelids bleed. it is super cool to have people stare at your hands with tiny cuts and bruises covering them. this thisorder of mine makes me want to take my life. it is not a fucking quirk, it is life ruining. please stop pretending to have i willnesses for a conversation starter. i am sorry for posting this here, i do not know where else to say it. thank you for reading i really appreciate it.	not depression
one man is dark view i joined as a door kicker, an infantryman. specifically a rifleman in the marine corps. after experiencing the military and a combat deployment to afghanistan, my personality has shifted drastically from who i used to be. before the military, i had a very active mind in politics, preserving the earth, idealistic and opti amistic. i cared, i volunteered and had a bright view of the world, sure it was not perfect but i had a passion for life and helping those around me. this old me attracted my high school sweet heart and we had incredible experiences together. her aspirations to start her own charity warmed my heart, we shared ideas of how we could serve the needy in the future, so much planning and so many deep thiscussions. i recognized a shift in my personality a couple years into the marines. as i was faced with the hardships that come with the military and the eventual experience of war itself, i noticed i was more and more pessi amistic as ti ame progressed. i became jaded, angry, and cynical of the world around me. slowly, life is value began to di aminish for me, i valued my own life less and less. of course i kept my brothers lives above mine, as marines our jobs is to make sure we get each other home alive and safe. that gave me a purpose and held me up. but as before, i believed myself to be an i ampactful individual on the world and politics around me, now i see myself as meaningless. we are born to die, the world wi will die, and i do not matter in the long run. it does not matter if i vote, it does not matter if i recycle, i wi will die and so wi will everyone else. as i changed, i created a thistance between me and my former love. she became ever more involved in politics and activism, growing an even greater love and passion for life and people. her spark grew into a roaring fire, while mine was quietly di aminished into cinder. we began to argue a lot more, my apathy was affecting our relationship. i just did not care anymore, i changed into an apathetic, angry person with a dark and cynical view of the world. i was a cold individual unable to express my emotions properly. i stopped doing things with her, spending more and more ti ame alone. the only ti ame we did anything was on the weekends when we would have sex. eventually she had enough and left after half a decade together. i went into afghanistan in the worst mental state ever, and i became bloodthirsty and homicidal. afghanistan was an experience, one that i find myself missing. the worst yet best ti ame of my life. a young man spending part of his pri ame in a god forsaken shit hole. i did not care about the afghan people, i did not care about the politics, i did not care about hearts and minds , i just wanted to ki will. in a way, i wanted to relieve all the anger and stress built up, even if it was in retrospect a sick and twisted way of thinking. we dropped bombs on buildings, we called in gun runs, anything to rack up the taliban body count. i watched taliban bodies fly into the air after being hit by rockets and landing with a satisfying splat, almost as if it was wet rag doll missing half of its body and instead of stuffing, organs and bones sloshed out. of course it was inevitable civilian and even friendly afghan forces would be collateral damage, but we always swept that under the rug as best we could. life is meaningless in a place where violent deaths were accepted as normal everyday occurrences. fast forward to now, i am struggling with depression. to what extent, i do not know, i do not ask for help except for that one ti ame i called the suicide hotline. i do not think i have ptsd, at least no symptoms have manifested themselves. my ex has gone on to be even happier with someone else, i have no more purpose in life after leaving afghanistan because all my friends got home safe. i firmly believe the world is doomed and humanity is destined to die out with a whi amper, a small and relatively unnoticeable stain left behind in this universe. why am i sti will here? i guess i just do not have the courage to end it, some part of me sti will wants to believe for the better. maybe i sti will have some opti amism left buried deep inside me, i do not know. i am just going day to day, maybe i accepted that life has no meaning and i am content, maybe i am just truly apathetic, i do not know. i am not asking for anyone to reach out to me, i only wrote this as a means to express myself publicly. this is a throwaway which i wi will probably never use again after this singular post. thanks for reading.	not depression

i feel like no one honestly cares about my problems i am homeschooled and lacking in social ski wills, so it is extremely hard for me to make new friends. i joined a streamer is thiscord server years ago and i met a few people who are the only people i talk to now other than family. they are usually pretty good friends, but whenever i have a panic attack or a breakdown they wi will just reply with calm down , drama queen , or just not reply at all. i am pretty sure they only have me around because i can be funny someti ames, and they do not actually care about me or my problems at all.	not depression
the meds and weird dreams i feel like i wake up more exhausted than when i go to sleep my dreams are.... very consistent i wi will have just one long dream instead of hoping from one to another all the mundane is shown, walking from place to place in real ti ame, etc it is less of a dream, and more of inhabiting the body of myself on a different ti ameline like jumping from ti ameline to ti ameline, seeing what the world is like and i wake up... soo exhausted. mouth dry.	not depression
i can not take care of myself. i hate myself. i can not bring myself to floss or brush my teeth, i have not properly showered in weeks or washed my hair. my room is a complete mess and i feel as if my family sees me as a thisgusting pest, not a family member. i do not know how to start functioning again. i am also diagnosed with buli amia and my eating issues make me even more depressed. how do i get out of this mess? my doctor does not want to change my anti depressants but they are not freaking helping! i am only , i should be out with friends or some shit. instead i am stuck in this self destructive state where absolutely nothing matters.	not depression
the ripple effects of bullying i was bullied through my entire school experience, and grew up in a toxic household which involved me being the family scapegoat and pretty much my whole family unleashing and bullying me as well. for much of my childhood i felt like nobody loved me or even liked to be around me. i was quiet and weird, played with bugs in the dirt and messy but i can genuinely say all i ever wanted was a friend or someone to be nice to me. luckily, i am out, i live with a group of beautiful people and have some incredible friends. unfortunately my brain wi will constantly tell me there is something else going on, like that everyone hates me, are trying to find a way to weed me out of the friendship group, people are only pretending to like me because they feel bad for me. i take every piece of information and spin it in my brain to mean i am about to be screamed at, talked about, or cast aside. i love all my friends so genuinely and deeply, but i just can not accept inside that they love me the same way. it is all me as well, nothing of their actions would suggest this is the case when i have space to look at the situation rationally. but when i am in it and the thoughts start i can not bring myself to think in any other way than that i am about to be fully outcast and i am not worthy of friends. it is selfish and stupid. does anyone else feel this way? what do you do to help yourself in the moment, if that is at all possible?	not depression
heavy pressure on chest okay so whenever i am in a rut i used to get this really bad pressure on my chest. it felt as if someone was pressing down on it and the only way i can relieve it is if i take a deep breathe sigh. i have gone to the doctor about it and she told me it was anxiety related. however i have started to feel it more and more lately, like everyday and it prevents me from doing study work. other people who suffer with depression anxiety i have spoken to about it do not seem to have this symptom . was hoping some of ye have an idea about this 	not depression
working theorem demonstrating my birthday anxiety depression it has already been proven that traumas can manifest as a variety of psychological irregularities in later years. the evidence is so overwhelming that i am abandoning this bit and going with a stupid talk show. today on i am a self loathing piece of audible gasp i never learned how to develop healthy relationships maybe related to not having a friend until the third grade. director is note, we re not going to dive into that third grade thing, but leave it in the title. intro video of me talking over is talk show shots birthday is can be tough. i fucking hate them. probably because i suck at them. i never figured out how to get people to like me i know be yourself . i am a poor reflection of other people is personalities. quick aside i was repeatedly called out in staff meetings and told several ti ames that i have no personality. that i was a flat bore. that a wet thishrag had more emotional range. they gave me extra training to no avail. i could not figure out why she was picking on me though, i had the best numbers in the call center . audience claps host let us get right to it i understand you have not spent a lot of birthdays with other people, but is there an early one that you can recount? me well, in the fourth grade, the night before my birthday i stayed at a friend is house. my mom called in the morning to say she was on the way. we were going down to her boyfriend s. i was a big momma is boy. alright, so me and my friend are downstairs watching a movie, but i am so anxious that i wi will miss her that i keep running upstairs to check for her car. it was taking way too long. you know, i am getting worried. then, the phone rings. it is my mom. she tells me that they came, knocked, and waited, but no one answered. she figured i decided that i did not want to go. so she wrote a note and had my sister put in on the door. i asked her to come back and pick me up, but you know, she could not. it would have taken like an hour to get there and another hour to get back. at that point it is too late to take the boat out, so you know, day ruined. better if they just continue on and i stay with my friend. she promised to call when they were done. host how pathetic me it was dark by then. she wanted me to stay the night at my friend is again because it was late, she was tired, and it was out of the way. i told her that i really wanted to come home. i amitates mother fine. but hey, it was not all bad. they did save me a slice of cake. host laughs really? me yeah, it was pretty nice of them since her boyfriend had bought the cake. did not have to give me any. plus it would have been to hard to bring the whole thing. host ... me ... host go on me right. birthday in the seventh grade, i thought i would take a three hour round trip bus ride to my old neighborhood to see my old pal and only friend. i called beforehand. right off the bat he warned i could not stay the night. i said that was ok, secretly thinking that if i missed my bus he would have to let me stay the night. he brought up that it was going to be late by the ti ame i got there, i would only have twenty minutes to hang out. i went anyway. it was more like five minutes. heard the laughter as i walked back to the bus stop. host humiliating me hmph. in the ninth grade my birthday fell on a sunday and i was big into church. the youth ministers took me to buy church clothes. i was elated. after church they gave me a card with signatures and money. host boorrrng, yet sti will pathetic. any other teenage boy would have hated getting church clothes for his birthday, but you... so starved for affection.. me in the tenth grade, my friend from the previous year we d moved again called me to say happy birthday. he asked what i was doing. which was nothing, of course, he invited me over. he said his mom had gotten a cake. she had not. host oh, is this this the friend that was trying to hook up with yo me yeah. that is the one. quick context my gf, who had forgot my birthday entirely, would soon break up with me. i was obsessive, possessive, controlling, jealous, the whole stereotype. well, once she ghosted me, i would ask my friend if he had seen her, if he could tell her to call me, that i missed her, you know, the usual. he said he had not seen her. did not talk to her. might say what is up in the halls, but could not remember. well, years later i would reconnect with my ex. turns out he was trying to get in there the whole ti ame. told her that he was not ever my friend, did not even like me. host ok, wrap it up champ. me young twenties birthday, i went to the casino. the dealer who logged me in saw the flashing birthday notification, he walked over to quietly say happy birthday. he asked what i was doing there on my birthday. i was embarrassed, i panicked. i said i snuck away from a party. host gross me another young twenties birthday driving around, drinking, bathing in self pity. my phone rings. it is my friend he asks what i am doing and of course i say points to audience audience nothing!! host smiles approvingly me that is right, nothing. he invites me to eat with hi am and his family? i wipe the tears and get the details. nobody said happy birthday. come to think of it, he never mentioned my birthday. was it a coincidence or worse, was it pity? i wi will just appreciate the love either way. host wow, this was sad, but i do not see what the big deal is. everyone has problems, your is are not that bad. no wonder nobody likes you. so self centered. audience jeers host agreed, screw that guy. haha. but seriously, are your birthday is sti will pathetic? me good question. i am not sure the answer. i have learned to cower. i take the day off. i do not advertise my birthday and nobody asks. it is fantastic. i can avoid the shame and embarrassment. there are not weird looks when i explain that i do nothing on my birthday because work and shopping are my only social interactions. shoot, i talk to myself more than i talk to others. full on conversations. host laugs coo koo me laughs no, not a back and forth, more like thinking out loud. i do not want to know why i do it though. to be fair not all of my birthdays are pathetic. there were at least one and a half good ones up there. host one and a half? me i have got more good ones. like i once tricked someone into being around me host if they were around you obviously they would been tricked. but, how did it go? me oh, the poor deceived soul.. on my birthday she took me on a full day of love. i mean, we did all the things she knew i liked. i blew off dinner with my sister and brother in law because there was absolutely no way this was going to last. someone showing me affection? they must be stupid. host it did not and they were. well that is it for our show today. see you next ti ame. just realized this reads a lot like joker. unintentional. but not surprising that even in writing about my life i am unoriginal. seriously. i am so fucking gross 	not depression
does anyone else get so bummed that there is no hogwarts or magic and the only thing to look forward to is a i was a bit of a loner as a kid, so i read a lot. i loved all kinds of books. i loved harry potter for obvious reasons but i always wanted to be magic and be taken away to hogwarts far away from my life. i remember reading the adventures of the wishing chair and longing to accidentally stumble upon one of these magic chairs at a garage sale and i would be taken away on adventures. i hoped one day i would realise i have special powers and fuck off to join the x men or something. basically, i am just really thisappointed in the reality of life. what is there to look forward to? i just read a post by someone else saying they gained weight because they did not care cus they would die soon and me fucking too. i am so fat now and none of my clothes look good. yesterday, i was in an uber and the guy is telling me all about how he moved here from kenya where he was a construction worker and tried all these degrees and did not like them but finally finished his finance degree so he could help his family and bruh, i can not even i amagine caring about anything so much that you have that much motivation y know? i am this year and i have tried so many different degrees and schools and nothing feels right. or more accurately, i just shut down and decide it is easier to not do it. idk?? which is another reason i am struggling with making plans for the future. my brain is all just ki will yourself it is easier . i was chatting to hi am about all the stuff i have tried to study on my way to get a tattoo and i was all it is just the concept of doing something for the rest of my life is so daunting and now i am sitting here like, bitch you am not have any problems getting tattoos left right and centre and they are for life so just pick a career too. this is more of a rant myself cus fuck my stupid self thanks if you read it	not depression
depression after hanging out with old friends whenever i meet my old friends for a night out, i get depressed after. i really enjoy the hanging out part, catching up on our lives, reminiscing the past, laughing and so on. but when i get home, i get depressed. mainly because you realized that all your friends have their own lives now and you can never go back to how you guys used to be. you wi will never see them again tomorrow or the next day, you wi will never see them again for atleast a long ti ame. you kinda miss the good ol days and you can never go back. and its just sad for me. anyone feel the same way?	not depression
today i saw this video and i cried https vi ameo.com ?ref fb share i know it does not say nothing new but it hit me very hard. it made me feel overwhelmed and crushed by the expectations. it made me feel like i wi will never be enough no matter what i do. it was very strong. i know this one is just about women, but i am sure men go through the same shit. it would be amazing if we well mostly the advertising world would just stop placing so many i ampossible expectations and we would just consider each other as flawed people to understand and care for. i feel defeated.	not depression
just because we both suffer, does not mean its not hard i have met quite a few people who like myself have struggled with mental health. it helps for us all to talk about it together, we all struggle but in different ways and to different extents. the worst thing though, is when people use their own experiences as a means of invalidating yours. oh i get depressed too but i do not do that, you should just do this it worked for me, it is not that hard i have done it. its things like this which just make it harder. like you re not good enough because you find it hard when clearly, it should be oh so easy. the key part about mental health, is its mental, it is in your brain which is fundamentally unique to you. it is not like a broken arm where everyone can do the same thing and get better. some things are going to work for some people and some people are going to struggle far differently. do not use your own experiences to invalidate another s, its not fair, its cruel and it is ignorant.	not depression

why are there so many people with depression? i visit this sub reddit occasionally with hopes of feeling that i am not alone with my mental health issues and that there are also people fighting hard to have a better life. however, the sheer volume of entries this sub gets and the so many people that can not find a way out of depression is insane. that why i wonder, what the hell is happening? why are there so many depressed people?	not depression
thank you i was pretty depressed over something and proceeded to drink a lot of alcohol and than i began to have suicidal thoughts because the alcohol only made things worse. i tweeted out i do not belong here and this girl i had not spoken to in years instantly texted me saying how concerning that was and proceeded to talk my way out of it. it is the little things.	not depression
mentally self harming i do not cut myself. i do, however, intentionally trigger all my insecurities and issues because i want to punish myself for being horrible and worthless. i constantly tell myself i wi will never amount to anything and that is why everybody is thissapointed in me. i would see a picture of a beautiful woman and i would i ammediately feel pain in my chest. god, i am so ugly. instead of avoiding it though, i wi will look at it more, causing more resentment to myself. i feel bullied. but it is not some person i only see for a fraction of my day. it is in my head, and i can not escape her.	not depression
this is about mental health hospitals in the uk. please read. i would like some insight of what you guys think i have been looking in to people is experiences in mental health hospitals. i been looking on youtube and stuff and for some reason i can only find women is point of views. there seems to be no men talking about there experience. is it because women get help faster or is it because men just do not like talking about it.	not depression
keep away from addictions people with compulsive behaviours always have a thiscomfort that they are trying to push away but that stays anyway. you try to drive it away with drugs or alcohol or whatever is your poison of choice but it comes back fiercer and the vicious cycle continues. i am honestly very glad that i do not have easy access to abusive substances. not that it keeps me from getting addicted to other seemingly normal addictions. but i tend to be obsessive about any thing that gives me some sense of joy. there is a history of addictions in my family and it is up to me to keep them at bay. i like to think i am strong and hope to never ever give into any self destructive tendencies like i did a few years back. live long and prosper.	not depression

hey to everyone sorry for my bad english. first off i know that a lot of you are going through worse stuff than me but let me just tell my story. i am a yo male and i always had lots of good friends and was really good at school. at least until about years ago. i switched to a new school and lost all my friends, because they stayed at my old school. i got to know a dude i wi will call hi am a that was in my class and we got best friends. that year my grades suddenly got really bad and i forgot a lot of homeworks. my math teacher was not that nice and some people in my class including me were really scared of her. i got bullied, got only one to two friends and my grades were bad. all of that lead to my depression. at least i had a as mental support. some ti ame passed and the relationship between me and my parents got worse, because they were getting calls from my teachers about my bad grades. to all of that i had an argument with a. i can not remember what it was about but now he does not really like me anymore, which really hurts because i have known hi am for a few year now and i always considered hi am as my best friend. so now i do not really have friends anymore, i got depression and bad grades and the relationship between me and my parents is really bad. honestly i am crying very often because i do not know what to do anymore or just had a really bad day. my last hope is to make it to a new school, where i attended, because there i would have subjects like coding , which i really like. i could also have some new friend. the only problem is that i have a which is a d in the uk i guess in subjects and the school i want to go to, has a lot of requests from students with better grades. and that is it. maybe you could comment, if you know something that could help me in any way. thanks for reading!	not depression

your attitude towars corona virus outbreak assuming you are depressed, diagnosed or not, i am curios about your attitude towards the corona virus outbreak, especially if you come from a nation city that has been locked down or where the cases are growing fast outside cina . are you scared? do not you care? do you wish it lead to a general collapse? do you actively act in order to spread the virus? write down your thoughts.	not depression
i do not know what i am trying to say i am sitting in bed. trying to stand up and start my day. i have things to do, things that wi will help me. for some reason i keep telling myself it is not worth it though. nothing i do wi will matter. it is all a story i am convincing myself of. i wi will either fail or succeed but either way it would not change anything because they were only goals i convinced myself were i amportant. i do not know how to sustain a mentality like this. i keep asking myself the question if there is something wrong with the way i am thinking or is the world and existence and my existence really that pointless. feels like a part i am being forced to play that i never had a choice in and it makes me mad at the world and then mad at myself for being mad because in the end i know anger is stupid and solves nothing. so i guess i wi will keep playing along. i do not really know what i am doing and i am pretty sure i am doing most of it wrong but there is not many other options. like the title says i do not know what i am trying to say or what i am trying to accomplish with this post. all i know is that right now i am alone with these thoughts and by putting them out there someone else might share them with me and maybe somehow that means something. probably not but it would just be cool to know i am not the only one having these kinds of mornings.	not depression

i give up, i am done. i can not take anymore. it is over. i spent the past eight years in the dating scene trying to find a good woman to befriend and make a friendship out of that wi will lead to a meaningful relationship. all i wanted was someone to spend the evenings with, the mornings and days off with. someone to do things with romantically and just in general. someone to go places with or just take a late night drive through a fast food drive thru and get a large milkshake to share together or just sitting in bed eating popcorn while watching shows or movies or late night talk shows. just someone i could get heavily involved with and enjoy life and make memories but all i have gotten for the past eight years was rejected, mocked at, made fun of, used for attention by unhappy married women, guys mocking me and making fun of my dating posts, trolled, catfished and everything else under the sun. all the love i have in my heart to give to someone else wi will be left ungiven and wi will die with me when i die single and alone and no one to spend ti ame with or get close to and make a life with. i get told oh well it is their loss not mine, but in the end is it really their loss? i feel like i am the one losing out. but enough is enough. i give up. i am done.	not depression

please stop blaming me i have been feeling like shit for so long i can not even remember not feeling this way. i do not know if i am pretending to be this way, the environment caused me to be this way or if i am just programmed to be this way. i sit all day and think about death. in almost years i have just opened up about this to one person but have casually mentioned having issues and needing to talk to some other people. i am scared to put my feelings on someone else is shoulder. i mean how can you possibly look at a person the same way after they tell you that they do not know what is real. i am in pain all the fucking ti ame. my chest hurts, i cry all the ti ame, my hands shake and i can not focus. i have my most i amportant exams going on for which i have been preparing for over a year and my brain gave up right at the i amportant ti ame. the idea of not getting out, not getting better and thissapointing everyone around me terrifies the fucking shit out of me. it is so difficult to go on. when my results wi will come out and they would not be as everyone expected to be, no one wi will understand why and if i tell them then they wi will say i am making up reasons and i am weak and it is my fault or i should have tried harder. but i literally can not keep doing this. i need to not feel this way. there seems to be this idea on social media where people say you need to be strong or its all in your head or you are to blame for your conditions or something but it is not my fault. i feel guilty for feeling this way but i should not be. i do not have anyone to talk to or even if i do i feel like i can not. my mouth literally shuts close. i can not bare this. this post makes no sense and is all over the place. i unloaded without giving it any second thought.	not depression

i read the book man is search for meaning recently aside from the horrific recount of the concentration camps, it also gave a sweeping diagnosis of the future for america and perhaps western civilization or global civilization now that automation wi will create a void existential vacuum , where the intended goal of more leisure ti ame wi will actually befall a mass depression where people on a wide scale wi will not understand their meaning or role in life. he goes on to talk about the wi will to live and i interpreted his writing as your lifeline attachment on this earth is on a spiritual level to some deeper meaning to life, whether it is finding purpose in work, family, dog dad, etc, but automation robots has replaced many of those roles, so now we do not know what to do with ourselves but be bored and depressed about it. and i amho, it is going to get way worse before it gets better, and better is incremental, given what we know. it is ironic to think that society is trying to upend gender roles norms for good and for bad maybe , but i am starting to realize they were insti willed for a very specific purpose. before it was like this is your community is intended purpose for your life and people walked that path, knowing their suffering had meaning. now we have created a society where we try to avoid suffering but then our lives begin to lose meaning. i think it depends on what kind of suffering like, central ac or electricity is different than being in a caretaker role, etc. just wanted to share. it is given me a lot to think about. what role do i play? what purpose does my life have? i am and wanting to move back in with my parents, just to be around them. i know being annoyed by them wi will make me suffer, but at least it has meaning. i suffer outside of their house too, but i find this meaningless. just wanted to kinda reflect and share my thoughts. if anyone else has read that book i would love to hear your thoughts.	not depression

my schoolyear is basically over now idk things have been kinda rough at school and i was happy to come home for break, but now literally everything is closing cancelled. i was looking forward to going back to school and at least trying to end my year on a good note and do well and try to make myself keep going to things activities, workout classes, things my religious organization hosts, the occasional party, etc. but now all of that is gone. i am very lucky to have a loving home to come back to, but no family is perfect and things fall apart after a while, which is what happened. i have friends but it is the kind of friendships where if i do not reach out, i do not hear from them. lately, even when i do reach out i do not hear from anyone. i really do not like myself at this point in my life, but i know that i am a good friend and i am constantly trying to i amprove, so it is hard when it feel s like it is all for nothing. this all just sucks, i feel like there is so much misinformation going around and everything is being stopped because of it. i definitely do think we need to take what is going on seriously and take precautions, but not to this extreme. i guess things always can get worse, and that is what is been happening.	not depression

musicians artists how do you get through creative lulls and a lack of inspiration. i have been writing playing music for a couple decades now the last couple years have been rough. there was a point where i would play music for at least a couple hours every day. now it is very common that my guitar wi will stay in its case until it is ti ame for my next weekly band practice. when i do play solo, it is turned to mindless noodling around rather than any writing because i am just so uninspired. typically in the past, that meant i needed to listen to more music. i believe with music you need to listen more than you play. so the solution was to have my mind blown by other more talented musicians and have that inspire me. but as of late, i do not listen to many albums anymore, just spotify playlists on random as background noise rather than foreground inspiration. music does not move me like it did a couple years ago. furthermore, the more i listen the more i realize it is all been done! we have a li amited number of notes to work with and a li amited way of arranging them. even stepping outside of the li amitations of tone western music, it is all been done. so not only is any active listening not inspiring me, it is actually thiscouraging me what is the point? i just sound like a cheap ripoff. i am very one di amensional, if i had to list my hobbies in the past i would say playing music. collecting records. that is it. i can not stay interested in anything else. so, when music is not happening for me, it is devastating. it is been a rough couple years. i should just quit music until the feeling of i need to play returns, but without music, i have nothing. and i am in a band where i am called upon to be one of the main songwriters, it is one of my only... wait, it is my only form of socialization making original music in a dead music scene. any advice on staying inspired to create while depressed? even when writing depressing material, i have needed to be happy inspired on some level to create.	not depression

it is dumb, but i want to end it because my job would not take me seriously. i have been working incredibly hard at my career since i was . being successful and well regarded in my job has been of the utmost i amportance to me as long as i can remember. i have always been underpaid and used in jobs getting closer to what i feel like i deserve after over years in my industry and close to being on par with the average salary in my industry. i have finally had the opportunity to have some control after my job fired everyone except for me and kept me around because i am the cheapest . yes, they said that to my face. i thought that if i worked hard enough i could prove i deserved my position and would be paid accordingly, but even at the threat of leaving this company and essentially my office wi will close down if i leave, they sti will wi will not pay me what i deserve. i am so tired of feeling like i am not worth anything when i have done nothing but continuously prove myself over and over. i have made this company mi willions of dollars from my work. i can not explain how crap i feel. and because this seems to be a running pattern, it must be me. there is something wrong with me. something that tells others that i have no value. maybe i do not. maybe i wi will never have any value. i do not want to keep trying to prove everyone wrong when clearly everyone is right and it is me who is wrong, thinking i am worth something. i want to give up and thisappear. i do not want to do this anymore.	not depression
i feel like my friends do not care about me and only talk to me and have a full conversation if they need something from me exactly what it is i have friends each two are in a relationship which each other they talk to each other a lot but when i ever i talk they do not pay attention or ignore me. i am a boring person to them and i follow behind them everyday but they never notice me. and if they do invite me somewhere mostly just to get lunch at school i am always ignored whenever i try to talk and they do not notice me and again, i am always. in. the back. it seems like nobody cares..it happens with every friend group i am in..and it fucking sucks... i may have people around me but i am sti will alone	not depression

an undesired second post as the title says, i have posted once here before. i never planned on doing so again as venting my issues just is not a coping mechanism for me, but i needed to do something. again, thanks to anybody who takes the ti ame to read. i am not the kind of person who is constantly sad or just feeling down. my problem is less being sad, but more just feeling nothing. i feel devoid of any emotional substance, but normally i continue on because that is what is expected me. however in the last hours i have watched multiple i amportant things in my life do a degrees and go straight to shit. it is like seeing loose threads, waiting to be pulled and unravel everything in front of my very eyes. i am anxious, i do not feel comfortable confiding in anybody and being a realist, i know that my situation is going to get much harder before it can become better. i truly feel lost in this world and it is becoming harder and harder to put on an act for everybody else. i am tired. i am broken down. i am scared to be fighting a losing battle that is uphi will no matter how i approach it. here is to hoping you all never see another post from me again. cheers, reddit.	not depression

it does not make a difference whether i am with my friends or not here goes nothing... so i am a second year international student in a uk university. i came here in and did not know anyone but made a friend at the airport, another international student. we were great together, we d go out and have our version of fun not clubbing like the majority of uni students cause i honestly hate it and i even met my now boyfriend when out with her. last summer she texted me out of nowhere saying she is dropping out. my grandma has also just passed away and honestly, i just felt like shit and cried for a few days i am not a crier. the beginning of second year was terrible, i felt lonely and depressed and the only one to snap me out of it was my boyfriend. he encouraged me to become better friends with people from my course and i did. it was all nice until a couple of days ago i had a bit of an argument with one of the girls in the group and now everyone is just avoiding me. if i ask a question directly to someone they wi will answer out of politeness but make it really awkward. when i left to go get lunch i said bye and no one answered. they all sat together and did not invite me over. at the end of the day, they all just left and did not say a word to me, even though i was right behind them. to make everything worse i am supposed to live with them next year and i have a hunch it is just going to be hell. oh, and my boyfriend is leaving town cause he is moving back in with his parents to save some money. his parents live really far away and i am just terrified i am going to lose hi am too. please give me some advice, i really do not know what else to do.	not depression

from someone who wants to be better to my ex you left me when i needed you the most. i know i pushed you away. i told you i might but i did not want to. i told you to leave me if you felt unwanted, but you did not. you chose to lie to me. you chose to use me. you wanted the world from me and i wanted to give it to you. you did not want to hurt me? i wi will never for get that. you chose the cowards path. you chose to cheat. you chose to cheat on hi am too. you lied to hi am too. but none of that matters. i am moving on without you while you leech happiness out of the people you clai am to love. i want no part in it and i never wi will. when you look back i hope you realize that a month of inattention is inevitable. everyone has their moments. to the reader i hope you do not ever experience this kind of pain. i hope you see the signs and act on them before it is too late. i hope you are strong enough to see you re sti will you without them. you re worth more than you think. life goes on so hold on and keep walking. closing i want more out of myself even if i do not know how. i am currently taking a leap of faith and moving out of my parents house. i hope i am making the right choice. but i would not know ti will shit meets fan. i am a jealous mess right now and i am working on getting over it. that is all i can do. just keep pushing. just keep pushing ti will my legs give out then push some more. wish me luck guys. i move out april st.	not depression
 m hair is falling out in stupid way and i hate it. for the past or months, my hair is been thinning out right at the top and the front. i do not have a bald spot, and my actual hair line is sti will relatively normal for my age sti will might be a norwood even . but for some reason it is like i am missing a crucial layer of hair at the top that is supposed to keep everything flush. there is just not enough hair to match the thickness of the sides and the back, so i look like a homeless crack addict or something. i keep getting faded buzzcuts now to try and not make the thisparity so obvious, but after about three weeks the homeless crack addict look starts to return because the sides and the back start to stick up while the top and the front stays matted and flat and split. i hate it. i hate it so fucking much. i do not want to spend my s looking like this. i have never even been with a girl yet and now my chances of attracting a girl have only gotten worse. i am trying my best not to let it get to me, but some days i get so insecure that i become reclusive and never even set foot outside. i already suffer depressive episodes and this makes everything worse. if this happened in my s or even s while i had already built up a suitable reputation in some sort of field then i wouldn t mind it, but now? when i am supposed to be young and dumb and sti will finding myself? this is fucking bullshit. fuck you mother nature and genetics. fuck you.	not depression
lack of motivation, fatigue removed 	not depression
not sure if i have depression and need some help not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but here it goes. some backstory i never thought of myself as having depression. i have always, though, considered myself lazy and unmotivated and have had pretty low self esteem as long as i could remember. recently this lack of motivation, drive, and self esteem has started to negatively i ampact my relationship of years. i just can not seem to make myself do what i need to do, to be thisciplined, and i have been consumed by self loathing. my so goes to therapy for their anxiety and has been talking to their therapist about the strain this is putting on the relationship. the therapist thought what my so was describing sounded like textbook depression and so my so relayed that back to me and suggested therapy. the thing is though, i do not really have that feeling of melancholy and sadness that you hear most when people describe depression. i just do not want to blame my personal faults on depression if i do not really have it. but i have tried many ti ames to change the things i hate the most about myself and have never been successful. i know this probably does not flow well so thank you for reading if you got this far. any suggestions welcomed and appreciated.	not depression

i can only find happiness from external sources i am not sure if i am depressed as i have never talked to a doctor or anyone about it. throughout my life i have always had periods of ti ame usually lasting between a couple weeks to a couple months, when i just feel so alone and that i do not want to keep going. i have definitely wanted to be dead, but i have never been close to suicide and i do not think i ever would ki will myself. usually these periods are triggered by some event, often relating to friendships or relationships. i was dating a guy for a few months and i was so happy. then we ended things, and i would break down crying on the way home almost every day for a month. someti ames about hi am, someti ames just from being sad and lonely. people say you need to find happiness on your own before trying to be in a relationship, but i feel that all of my happiness comes from external sources like this. how do people find happiness in being alone?	not depression

i am struggling to help my depressed friend... i am really trying but they constantly berate and lash out at me i am at the end of my tether, so i would really appreciate some advice please. a friend of mine who i have known for nearly years had a bit of a bad turn in the past two years. he is based in one country, and i f, currently live halfway across the world. he is what you would consider friends who are family . or least i thought so. lately, i am finding it very difficult to deal with hi am, and i feel that i should cut hi am out of my life. a summary of his situation . his marriage fell through a couple of years ago. his decision. he has one young child bit of a mess, he broke up with her whilst she was pregnant, something i never agreed with . they were having problems for years he clai ams she is the reason for many of his mental health issues. . since then he has gone from not drinking to drinking regularly. sleeping around, making friends with weird people etc . it reached a stage where last year he was talking to me about suicide, and how he has planned his death several ti ames. he talks about how no one in his life is there for hi am mum, dad, ex wife, sister . . now he has fallen into trouble with the law, accused of something pretty serious. i have no doubt in my mind he is innocent despite the changes of the past few years , so that is not even a question. just to add context to his background, he is educated to doctorate level, intelligent and has a good job he is currently suspended until police make a decision whether to charge hi am and has never been in trouble with the law before. the issues i encounter . at the best of ti ames, he is quite insensitive in the way he deals with people. he can be quite cutting with his words at ti ames, and i feel in the past, he has not been there for me when i needed hi am the most a couple of situations . that being said, he was married, in a different country...etc. so i kind of get it. people get busy with life. . because of a childhood complex, he does not like people giving hi am advice. so even when you try to have a conversation with hi am, and offer some solutions, he lashes out about it and gets angry. . i have recommended therapy because i know how much it helps. he says he has been, but was never given any medication he is not sure if he wants to take meds , and since the one ti ame he went, he has not said anything else about it. tbh, i do not think he even went back. . more recently with this trouble with the law situation... he would send messages like i am going to be charged... i just know it. i am going to lose my child. i have no faith in the justice system. i can not go to prison. if i am charged, that is it i am ending my life. . i personally feel he is not taking enough action. he is not speaking to many lawyers, for instance. he is with one lawyer who does not seem to be doing much. he comes across as being very indifferent about the whole process. he asks me what i would do if i am in his position. i tell hi am. his response? you do not think i have not thought of that? you think i am just sitting there doing nothing? you think you re all high and mighty. i have never been in trouble with the law. i am so scared. i have no idea what to do or how anything works. etc. i ask hi am if he trusts the lawyer he is with. he says i do not know how do i even figure that out? . after his latest outburst, i told hi am to get his act together and enough with the victi am mentality. in hindsight, my choice of words were not great but there is only so much i can take. i attempted to explain to hi am that the concept of victi am mentality also applies to genuine victi ams i had spoke to this with my therapist before , i never once i amplied he was faking it, but in order for an individual to create change they have to leave the victi am mentality and go into survival mode. to me, he is being defeatist right now when he needs to fight to clear his name. no one in the world can do something like that for you but yourself. it is what i would do personally. . he responded by saying he thought i was a thisgusting human being and an insensitive prick . and for the past hours has latched on the words victi am mentality when i fully explained what my point was. he then proceeded to say no matter how many ti ames i tell you, i have no idea what is going on. you re just assuming i am sat at home being defeatist. earlier, he made a reference about how i have always butted in about his life. the funny thing is... it has always been hi am coming to me with the problems. i even went through old emails today to make sure i am not going crazy. what do i do? i am tired. i feel i am his emotional punchbag. despite hi am calling me thisgusting, i am trying to be there with support just for the sake of his child. every ti ame he has gotten angry accusing me of having no idea what is going on, i have reminded hi am that i am not in his environment. i am not in the middle of it all, therefore i just go by what he is telling me from halfway across the world. which is usually not much. he is the one who usually initiates conversation with messages like i know i am going to jail. i just know it. i try my best to be there and listen, whilst trying to offer some hope. i have offered financial support for legal fees. i have offered to talk to lawyers i know. i have offered friends who are connected to law. he has not taken any of my offers. he complains about advice given to hi am. then asks me what i would do if i were in his position. i answer, and then he gets angry at me. you know that feeling of that you can not win, no matter what? i do not know what he wants, and i do not know how to help hi am. i have had my own mental health issues, but it is in my personality is just to own it and do something about it. i made myself go to a psychiatrist i took the medication i made myself go to a therapist. i strongly believe that no one in the world can help you but you you need to be the one to take action to save your soul. not everyone is the same, i understand that. but this is not helping my own mental health. i have never wanted anything from my friendships, but it does not feel good to absorb this much negativity on a delay basis. it does affect me. his words can be i ammensely hurtful at ti ames. i understand that this might be due to what he is going through, but there is only so much i can take before i am at breaking point. i apologise for this being a long read, but i wanted to offer as much background as possible. i am hoping i can connect with someone who could give me advice on what to do in this situation. thank you.	not depression

my day was better than i thought after work i decided to schedule a last minute therapy appointment, i have been contemplating it but felt it was not necessary. as it got closer to am i started to get frantic and overwhelmed, i did not want to go anymore. signing in i was shaking i have never been to therapy and i did not know what to expect, the fact that i was alone in this place terrified me. i get so worried they are just going to say i am crazy and lock me up. meeting and speaking with the therapist was not as horrible as i thought it would be. i sti will feel stupid, now i have included a stranger in my mess.. i wi will be going again to learn ways to properly deal with this empty feeling, i know i have a lot of baggage but it was nice to finally speak to someone about everything and get a different perspective. i am not suicidal anymore, i am empty and i would like to believe there is more to life than this void. i feel a bit more positive overall and i did tell them i do not want medication, i used medication as a huge crutch and it made me worse if any thing. i am ready to take the next steps forward in taking back my life. i needed to do this for me and my dog he is my motivation, i would do anything for hi am i love hi am and getting better for hi am is my biggest goal.	not depression

an open letter to the guys that mocked a suicide victi am this is something i wrote a while ago, summer of . it is on my mind today and i thought i would share it. i am sorry that i spoke out of turn and said that you do not know what you re talking about. i should not presume to know your personal journey. but when the topic of a suicide victi am comes up, and you mock the dead, i do not think you do know. that boy was either severely depressed, or mentally i will, or some other si amilar ailment. he reached out to that girl. i do not know if his intent was to cry out for help, to say goodbye, or to make her feel guilty. i do not know, because he is dead. he is dead because he got back in the car. she urged hi am to do it. she told hi am to get back in the car. would he have done it anyway, no matter what? i do not know, but that is what you said, laughing about it like he was such a fool. he is the one who did it, you said. she did not make hi am get back in the car, you said. words like idiot and stupid were used. so i spoke up. i am sorry, but y all do not know what you re talking about. one of you said your brother ki willed hi amself, the other said you d lost some friends. i am truly sorry for your losses. that is not what i meant, though. until you have been there, you do not know. until you have actually been on the brink of suicide. until you have stood there, racking your brain, weighing the pros and cons of life or death. thinking of all the reasons you should just do it. how you have accomplished nothing in life, and you have nothing to offer the world. how your family and friends would not miss you that much, and wi will be better off without you. i have been there, close, a ti ame or three. only once was i prepared to go through with it. i was stopped by a chance call from my then soon to be ex husband, calling to gripe at me about something i do not even recall all these years later. he did not know what was going through my mind, he did not know what i was about to do. i did not tell hi am. he was mean and entitled and it made me so angry. that anger is what stopped me. i did not know what i was going to do, or how i was going to manage, but for the first ti ame in a long ti ame, i was angry instead of just hopeless. it took something so tiny to pull me back up. to this day he does not know that he unintentionally saved my life. maybe it is petty, but i do not feel he deserves to know. i sti will have moments when i wonder what is the point. i am open about my struggle, as open as i can be, with my friends and family. it is not easy. my heart know all the reasons to keep going, the ones my head someti ames forgets. i take things one hour at a ti ame, because an entire day can be overwhelming. days like today, though, they hurt my heart. they leave me feeling a little more broken. forget sticks and stones... words can fucking hurt. again, my heart goes out to you for the loss of your friends, and your family member. but unless you have actually been in their shoes, in my shoes, you do not know.	not depression
a lot of us wi will have to stay away from work due to the covid outbreak. here is some things you could do to stop a downward spiral. aif you are, like me, a semi functional depressed, work is giving you a lot of stability for everyday life. i am currently in an opti amistic state and i want to try to share a couple of ideas on what to do with all the extra ti ame rather than fall back into bad habits and start or continue a downward spiral. an extra advice is to write down, what you have done that day, without judging your activity as in if it is a day spent in bed, just write it down, do not beat yourself up over it! . some might require buying tools in advance, just make sure you wash your hands before and after. repairing all stuff that is broken in the house why is my fridge sti will leaking and my knife so dull, damnit?! deep cleaning yeah i know it is not fun, but do i actually sti will need that mixtape from ? pick up a ski will i recently learned how to backe bread, and make si ample cheese. but you could do woodworking or other useful stuff. try some crafts this is not useful as a ski will would be. it is ll about fun, arts amp crafts and things such as bookbinding, painting, drawing, building plane models, whatever rocks your dyi boat. reading oh yes, you can find out what kind of literature you actually like, not the stuff you have been told to read by teachers. boardgames assuming you re not alone in that situation and it is more about prevention than one of the family being i will because do not share cards and dice, if you do not want to catch the bug! . there are tons of cool games out there on different levels of ski wills. fitness if you somehow managed to keep a habit of doing sports or even going to the gym, try to make a home workout possible yoga mats, weights and other things often do not cost incredibly much. other things like digitizing old photos, getting things in order ...paperwork...?! i know this sounds ambitious and in noooo way, am i going to do all of them. but lets start with one, first step,. if you have anything to add, please do. let me hear if you made plans yet.	not depression

 htp plus st johns wort i am wondering if anyone has tried this combination. il just quickly explain why i am asking on a quick search of reviews i can see people are saying the efficacy of htp is very high, but the scientific evidence is it is not. digging deeper, it was not difficult to find some unique use cases for htp one of them was people using it on a comedown for mdma. if you read them threads youll realise that there must be truth to this as there is no advantage for those guys to recommend that for sales or other. further, drs wi will deny htp value but recommend not to take with ssris as this wi will cause serotonin syndrome. it is therefore my opinion that the mechanisn for this is using a drug with inhibits the reuptake of serotonin ssri in conjunction with a substance that increases the level of serotonin in the body in general htp that causes this issue. back over to mdma, we know that this drug wi will inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline in huge quantities. the risk to taking htp too early on the comedown is highlighted by many users. i think its obvious to add this point to say that it is by the same mechanism that htp helps on a comedown. the potency of the mdma is decreasing as it goes past its half life. the htp pushes a surge of serotonin into the system and the drug can sti will use that as the mdma effects become weaker. easing the withdrawl symptoms of mdma. another possible onservation to be made at this point. the people who find relief from htp alone wi will have issues producing serotonin but not in the bodies efforts to regulate the neurotransmitter. for those where htp alone does not work it is because the body isnt able to do anything useful with the serotonin in the system. cue st johns wort, according to research this works si amilarly to ssri for both serotonin and dopamine. in fact adding tyrosine into the mix could potentially increase the leves of dopamine also as it is its precursor. in theory a mix of htp and st johns wort could be as effecting as presciption medication.	not depression

roommate is depressed, unsure what to do my , f year old roommate seems to be depressed. i say seems to be as we do not really talk a lot. she tends to hole herself up in her room for days on end, only coming out to eat and use the bathroom. i am not sure what to do or how i can help her as she is years older than me. she is also very secretive, she does not like to talk or chat much. she does not have family, as i understand it she is an only child and her parents were quite old when they had her, so they sadly passed away at a young age. we are living in europe but she is from asia, and i have never heard of any family visiting her. i know she has nice friends as i have met a couple of them, but she rarely goes out to see them or invite them over anymore. the flat we share is one that i found a couple of years ago, so in reality it is my apartment but i got a roommate as i can not afford it by myself. perhaps she thinks for this reason, she does not need to put as much tlc into the house as i do. the issue i am having is the fact that she is neglecting on her household responsibilities. we live in a two person flat share, and in the last six months i have had to take care of probably of the housework as well as the bi wills. this is something i have mentioned to her a month or so ago, the fact that i am struggling with taking care of the house by myself and cleaning up for two people and that i needed help. the split should be on household fees such as internet and cleaning supplies, at the moment, this is all on me as well as general cleaning. i know that she knows about this, and i know she knows this really irks me, but she sti will fails to help with housework on a regular basis. i have seen her mop a floor for example less than five ti ames probably since she moved in here half a year ago and it is the sloppiest work i have ever seen. she wi will take one of those dust wipers, without putting a cover on it, spray window cleaner on the ground and mop over that. the result is a greasy, slippery kitchen floor that needs to be re mopped anyways. or another example, is the trash can wi will be full, and rather than just taking it out we live on the ground floor , she wi will just pile more and more things on top of it that the bag rips and the bin needs to be cleaned again, by me . i wi will come home late at night after work and she wi will be sprawled on the couch, with the trash sti will not taken out. this has obviously led to some ani amosity between us. i work pretty regularly, and someti ames i wi will leave the house and see it needs to be mopped and vacuumed, and while i work the whole day she is holed up in her room, i come home and nothing is done. even something as si ample as putting the thishes away when they have already been washed and dried. someti ames even after an hour shift, i am the one cleaning the entire house kitchen, living room and bathroom while she stays in her room. and i never even get one word of thank you. i do not like to confront people, and i have already reminded her several ti ames that she needs to pull her own weight if she is living here. i think she can sense that i get extremely pissed off when she does not do her part of the household duties, so she hides herself in her room and only comes out when i am in the bathroom or in my bedroom, which only makes the household tensions higher. we rarely talk, and when she does come out of her room she looks obviously depressed. just total unhappiness in her face. i know the depression is not something i can help with, i think even by mentioning the fact that she looks depressed to her wi will only sour the household relations even more. i know she wi will take it the wrong way if i try to offer her help. my question is, how can i make her pull her own weight in the house and help me with housework when she is obviously depressed? i do not like the current arrangement where i, as a year old girl, am pulling the weight of two people rather than just my own. to me her supposed depression is not something that is excusable for a lack of performing half of the household duties. am i just being to insensitive? how can i approach a roommate who does not even like to talk to me about this?	not depression

depression does not thiscri aminate you dont need a reason to be depressed. nothing bad has to happen. it is a medical condition, and i ambalance of chemicals in your brain. your sadness and pain is all valid. if you take medication for it you be probably heard people is thismissive comments about the side effects or how you just need to exercise and eat your veggies. but the honest truth is that there is something wrong with you. and while there is something wrong with you is not abnormal, you are not alone and please dont make yourself do this alone. your brain is a lump of meat sitting in chemical soup, of course its going to get confused someti ames and send out the wrong signals or none at all. just like you take medication for blood pressure or diabetes antidepressants, antianxiety, and antipsychotics are all valid medications. people who have depression and anxiety are often seen as weaker, when in reality it is entirely the opposite. they are the strongest, most empathetic people. please do not be ashamed to get help. and if you ever need anything, just to talk or whatever, i am here. i have been through this journey, i am sti will on it. but i am out of the deep and i am seeing the bright side, and i really want everyone around to see it with me. i love you.	not depression

a comprehensive guide on slowly getting better, and not losing hope. in no way am i an expert, and in no way have i mastered these points, but i have had depression for about years now, and i have seen what works and what does not, and i wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but i believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub. i write this because it makes me feel better, and because i like to help other people. it makes me less depressed. if someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, i wi will be happy and grateful for it. being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves. in no way are these ordered from most i amportant to least. in no way am i suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self hatred. i do not see hope for myself, but i believe in it regardless. i hope you can too. exercise daily do something you like. it does not have to be the most intense, fat burning, crazy workout. all i am saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. try out the gym for a couple months, ai aming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. try going and being active a couple ti ames a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. it can be anything from karate to chess trust me, this actually burns a significan not amount of calories! , from swi amming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a shaolin monk eat healthy we always hear this one, and for good reason! it is si ample, but it gets hard, does not it? we want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. i am not saying pizza is off the table forever, but i am saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! contrary to popular belief, healthy food can taste good. many depressed people have low levels of vitamin d like me so i take those regularly alongside some magnesium supplements. i believe overti ame this wi will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical i ambalance a different way. take meds if you need them talk to someone. if they suggest pi wills, try them out. i have had pi wills that swung me the right way lexapro , and i have had pi wills that swung me a very, very bad way some green looking pi will, i do not remember what it was but i hated it dude . everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. just... try it. i know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pi wills for depression and taking pi wills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. not a cure, but a step. journal this is a big one for me. i have kept up journaling ever since i was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. writing things down like this has a way of soothing the soul, i think. write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy hopefully at some point. clean your room i suck at this, but there is something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. you ll feel better, trust me. read this is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but i do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. no, not a book that you hope wi will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. read matilda for all i care! i read that book in one toilet session and i felt great the rest of the day. go outside once a day all i am saying is minutes. at least. you can manage that. there are days where i self isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the funk it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. just do something. general hygiene big one. this is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. you ll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, tri am your beard, de odor yourself, whatever! you ll feel slightly better if you look and smell better. sleep well i am talking hours at night and not throughout the day. do not waste the day away by taking little naps all the ti ame. do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. you wi will feel better. you would not be cured, but you ll feel better. your body needs this, friend. wake up early again, this might not be for everyone as a matter of fact, who is it for really , but trust me when i say that almost every ti ame i wake up early and do some stuff i like, the rest of the day feels better because i did something productive at the start of it. i get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it is great! be wise with money i know, many people may not agree with me here. i fail in this aspect a lot, so i am not saying i am i ammune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but i am telling you guys that life is better without it. i went a year without it once, and seriously it made a huge difference. i believe that we can love our fellow humans better without porn or masturbation. you may thisagree, but i stay by this conviction. compli ament people, spread positivity, without expecting anything in return this is a great one. even if you do not believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. here is the catch do not do it for your own gain. do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. you want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise. do not stay in your house or room for too long poor ti aming on this one, i know. but go for a walk or something this comes at an awkward ti aming, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. my worst days are when i am just scrolling reddit or pornhub or facebook and when i am just... wasting myself away. get out of your room, be productive, do something. serve other people in some way this is a bit different from compli amenting people, but the premise is the same. help others. join a non profit organization and help out once a week. you meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. there is nothing like it! you are doing something amazing, even if it is small. you are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. this could really change your life, as it has mine. get together with friends get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. whether it is at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, anything. just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. this may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago and all of high school too , but try it out. the right people wi will come, i am sure of it. call family whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. it has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, thisconnection, abuse anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. but someti ames you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other. listen to music duh! we all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. for me it is coldplay and a little known artist named chris renzema. they have been with me through ups and downs lots of downs . i also listen to wi william augusto instrumentals as i fall asleep each night. very helpful. try out therapy for a couple months it can be scary, i know. and for me personally therapy did not even fully work out for me. but this does not mean i did not try it. i tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because i did not feel any differently. this would not be the same for everyone. at least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend. li amit screen ti ame if you can help it less ti ame on the phone, less ti ame on the computer, less ti ame on the tv. all great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? find a schedule that works for you. i personally am trying to lower my screenti ame on my phone to hours a day, and eventually to hours. small goals, one step at a ti ame. make daily to do lists most days, in the morning or the day before, i create a to do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. i even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what i accomplished and so i can put a little checkmark besides it! take care of a pet i recently got a bearded dragon his name is henry , and it has given me something new to live for and protect. as someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. send me pictures of them so i can tell you how cute they are. be in nature i believe this is for everyone. get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. try to travel to a national park at some point, and take in the sights. go for a short hike and look at the trees. we are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it. nofap, noporn i know, many people may not agree with me here. i fail in this aspect alot, so i am not saying i am i ammune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but i am telling you guys that life is better without it. i went a year without it once, and seriously it made a huge difference. i believe that we can love our fellow humans better without porn or masturbation. you may thisagree, but i stay by this conviction. practice gratitude stay thankful for the things that you have. whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. again, i do this too, so let us get better together. now, i am a devout protestant christian, and i wanted to include my christian side to this equation. this is the most i amportant part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason i am sti will alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step. pray for others and yourself read the bible this is the thing upon which we compare everything else. this is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the lord speaks to his people through his word. learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the one who loves us. meditate christians meditate too! take ti ame in silence and align yourself with the holy spirit, as he speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth. get together with church community listen to worship take ti ame alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in jesus name, or are sti will depressed this side of eternity and are sti will trusting in the direction of the one who gave it all for them. hope, my friends. hope. take steps to better yourself. give yourself grace. keep trying. hope, my friends. hope. 	not depression

psa with many companies moving to work from home due to corona virus. this was post on fb by a friend of mine, i would never want to take credit for her words, but it should be here. also, on mobile, hopefully the format is not horrible. many of us are moving to a work from home lifestyle for at least the next several weeks. this sounds like a dream to many of us. however, regardless of your feelings on working from home a few ti ames a week, i want to take a few minutes to remind everyone about the i ampact long term work from home situations can have on your mental health. loneliness is already an international pandemic being recognized by countries as a major crisis. in fact, the uk has a minister of loneliness dedicated to finding ways to mini amize what is happening https en.wikipedia.org wiki jo cox commission on loneliness . mental health should be a top priority for everyone all the ti ame. but with everyone restricting social interaction, we are heading down a potentially dangerous path. i urge you to take this weekend to do a few things to set yourself up for success. my suggestions are thus take them for what you wi will. tidy up find the area you wi will be doing your work, and make it neat and tidy. clutter wi will cause you to feel stress, and is likely to make you think about all the things that need to be done around the house. mini amize the clutter, lower your stress. divide your space if your only work space is near your bed, do what you can to divide your spaces. long curtains and room dividers are a blessing. if you can not do this, consider working from your living room or kitchen table somewhere your brain already associates being active. add plants add plants to your space! i am the absolute worst at keeping plants alive. the concept of a green thumb is lost on me. however, even fake plants can correlate to a positive boost in serotonin. ti ame outside take minutes a day to go outside and let the sun get on your skin. doing this ti ames a day has been scientifically proven to increase serotonin levels. decorate if you are like me and have a house that is basically just white walls, do what you can to remedy this. having decor in your house, especially green decor, wi will make a marked i amprovement on your mood and your productivity. play with your pets we all love our ani amals, and unless they are cats they love us. take minutes every minutes to play fetch, snuggle, or pet them. not only wi will the mental break from work give you a boost to performance, but your brain wi will release hormones to help combat depression and loneliness. schedule ti ame together many of us are not going to be having visitors. however, if there are others in your household, make it a point to spend ti ame with them each night. whether it is eating as a group, playing a game, or si amply throwing a ball outside, the human social interaction is crucial. reach out a lot of us use facebook and other social media platforms to watch our friends and family from a far. this is nice when we have only a few minutes to scroll through posts and see what is going on with those we love. but it is more i amportant now than ever to actually reach out and talk to people. use faceti ame, whatsapp, facebook messenger, whatever you use to have as close to in person conversations as you can. by taking a few small actions, you can create a huge i ampact on your mental health. i know that i am no expert, but there are hundreds of studies, and thousands of articles on how each of these things wi will help you and your loved ones. also, consider making a few of these things permanent changes for your lifestyle. mental health is not something to be taken lightly. we all deserve to be happy. we all know it is hard. so let us do what we can to give ourselves a fighting chance.	not depression
can not rely on myself it is my subconscious. remember? i can not control it. leonardo dicaprio is character just takes the words right out of my mouth with that one line from inception. now, obviously movies can not be trusted to represent reality. but it perfectly encapsulated how i have felt about my existence and living in my own body for, well, as long as i can remember. i can not rely on myself. i am inconsistent. debilitating emotion comes in waves, half the ti ame seemingly from nowhere. yet the whole world needs you to be reliable. i can not trust my own feelings i can not keep playing pretend half the ti ame just to put on airs of being consistent . does anybody else understand what i am saying here? i am not strictly looking for answers or something. i want to make sure that what i am saying makes sense it is one of the big things i am going to tell my therapist. thanks.	not depression
here is where i am at. my room is full of literal garbage. i just spi willed a can of backed beans on the floor, and while trying to pathetically clean it up with hand sanitizer and kleenex, i spi willed a can of chili on my bed. the floor is sti will stained. i am not going to wash my sheets. i have had over half a handle of vodka since friday night. i passed out in my recliner, got three hours of sleep, and then i ammediately continued drinking when i woke up. i am on a mix of prozac, vyvanse, alcohol, and thc. i am going to finish the rest of the vodka before i go to bed tonight. this hurts to read, does not it? because you know there is a real person on the other end. listen if you feel concerned reading this, i urge you to look at yourself. you may not be as low as me right now, but if you feel compassion for me over the internet, you deserve to have compassion for yourself. do not let yourself go down this path. you are worthy of love and happiness. i know i am too, and i am trying. kind of. either way, i wi will be alright. this is not the first ti ame. really not sure why i am sharing this. i wish you well.	not depression
i think i am functional depressed, if that is a thing i can get my children to school, but then i lay in bed until i have to get them. then i sit on my couch until i have to make dinner. then i wait for my spouse to come home and i make hi am dinner, then we watch tv, joke around, etc. then go to sleep. nobody in my life knows, including my husband. he thinks i am running around all day, etc.	not depression
for the first ti ame in a year i feel like i am doing okay again i walked passed the hospital i was taken to when i overdosed last night and i smiled because i realise that after the worst year of my entire life i am finally feeling like myself again. the bad days sti will come but i feel like the person i used to be again. everything fell apart and it taken me a while but i am finally piecing it back together again	not depression

depression with corona hello, with the virus that has been going on, everyone is understandably , urged not to meet people or partake in social events. i have had depression and anxiety for years medicated , and i am on the more extroverted side. part of my safety plan and making sure my mental health is good is doing social events, seeing friends. i have started a new job in a new country i have been there before but it is not my home country . i am worried with this social isolation my depression wi will get really worse, after all the effort i have done to maintain it. any advice from other people w depression and extraverted tendencies? i can not go back, i have worked too hard.	not depression
i feel ashamed for being a virgin i can not stop feeling severe shame for being a year old male kissless virgin. it is influencing my daily life severely, it makes me feel severely insecure and inferior to everyone else. i am also an unlikeable person, i am quiet and stoic. most people do not like people like me, they prefer bubbly extroverts. i am probably just meant to rot away in a corner or something.	not depression

i just want a best friend i just want someone i can message at any ti ame, when i am really happy or really sad, when i am bored, when i want someone to talk to or whatever else. it really sucks laying in bed late at night, wanting to talk to someone, but you do not have anyone to talk to.	not depression
worthless and alone just feel so fucking alone. problem is, that i do not really want to chat with new ppl, just sucks feeling like the few friends that i have are losing interest in me. i guess i do not really deserve them to begin with.	not depression
for once, i was actually looking forward to something i have concerts happening in may. i also had concerts last year in october and once those were over i started to just live for those happening in may and now i have to fear for them being cancelled. i do not know what i am supposed to do if that happens. i wi will literally end myself. i do not know how but i wi will, if things wi will be ruined. this is all i have been living for and for once everything was working out and it would have been perfect and now the only thing in my head is the fear. i saw events being rescheduled into . just because stupid people have to make everything look worse as it actually is. i am scared and i just want it to end.	not depression
i can not believe myself. i was doing so well, my wife paid off my debt, i cleaned up my act and now it is all for nothing. i lost all my money playing poker. i can not believe i just went against everything i worked towards. i can not believe i just let my wife down after all she is done for me.	not depression
i can not cry i am a shy boy. i never reveal my feelings. so over the years my anger, my sadness, my hapiness has just i been collecting and really want to let them go away. but i can not. it wi will not let me. i am just stuck here with a gazi willion emotions in my head.	not depression
hygiene problems anybody here with hygienic problems that has managed to beat them? i have really let my teeth go over the years because i am just so fucking depressed that i can not be bothered to brush my teeth or shower most of the ti ame. i am both too embarrassed about it and too poor to afford to go to a dentist and get the care that i need.. like, i come home from exhausting shifts at work and i just want to escape from reality either by doing drugs and losing myself or watching tv, or playing video games. it is become such a habit that i routinely ignore taking showers, cleaning my room, brushing, etc. if anyone here can share their experiences or any advice on how to break this cycle of just waking up and going to sleep without taking care of yourself over and over, i would greatly appreciate it.	not depression
the one relationship i manage to get in is already failing i am f and asked out a girl f yey, reddit terms . we are both lgbt obviously hence why we are dating, haha. her parents are pretty religious and strict, and her dad used to be an abusive maniac i do not know too much about this yet . i asked her to be my gf pretty quickly and she said yes! she has not come out to her parents yet, and when i asked if we could meet up for a first date she said that she can not because her parents would not let her. she then stopped messaging this happened a day ago . i was worried and messaged her a few ti ames today. i do not use snapchat much, but i used it to talk to her since it is easier. it showed up that she opened my messages and has not responded . she is pretty much ghosted me. i asked her friend, who told me she is at her grandmothers house and can not message. but i am not sure if she is telling the truth. i am so miserable at the moment.	not depression
what now? i feel guilty for thinking of myself during a ti ame where people are suffering and dying. i am sorry. but i do not know what do do anymore. i am a freshman in college and ive been going through a lot of different shitty things all at once, and i was at a really really low point. but finally about two weeks ago i reached a point where i felt like everything might be okay, for the first ti ame in months. i realized that i had found my place, i had met friends like never before, who i trusted and loved and felt more connected to than any other friends i have ever had. but then the entire world gets sent home from college. my high school friends and i have grown apart and are sti will friendly, but i miss the closeness we used to have. not going to lie, i am a little hurt by it, as i tried to keep close contact with my best friends, but their lifestyles rightfully took them in different places and now i feel like our old circle of friends has divided into groups, none of which i fit into. i am just an outlier, liked well enough by all of them but not needed or really considered. i do not want to be like no one likes me because that is not the case, they do like me. but i feel like they kind of forgot about me. we re all in different places now, and now i am just stuck at home like it is high school all over again, but this ti ame i am without my friends. i feel like i have no one. all i do is sit at home and lay in bed, and i wi will for weeks or months to come. i do not know what to do.	not depression
i do not know i came back from a month break from social media including reddit and honestly i feel like nothings changed and maybe even gotten worse. i do not know what is happening to me, it feels like everyday is a drain to live and i hate waking up in the morning to face everything all. over. again. i am just so tired and even if i take a break from it all school work etc nothing fixes anything and i just either feel guilty, anxious or just feeling nothing. i fucking hate life. i hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it. the only reason i am ranting here is because i have no one to talk to i just hope everything wi will end soon.	not depression
living is tiring life feels so pointless. i do not enjoy anything if anything i am just cynical towards most things. i am tired. so tired. i have one new friend and i i amagine she wi will get tired of me because even after i try i am draining on others. who wants to be friends with someone that is a bummer when they are trying to get better themselves. i feel like this is all i wi will lever feel. this is who i am and i would not change	not depression
it is almost pm and i have yet to get out of my bed it is a nice sunny day outside, i need to do laundry, grocery shop, eat, and clean my room but i can not build up any motivation. so i am stuck here on reddit doing absolutely nothing but reading toilet paper memes. help. me.	not depression
buy clothes and never wear it i enjoy buying new clothes and the whole process of shopping. when i get new stuff, i am very excited to try it on and wear it as soon as i can. but i always end up not liking it on me and hide it in my closet ti will the next ti ame . or pretty often looking back at my recent pictures i ask myself why would you wear this? 	not depression
young, dumb and in love ? i hate falling for someone. even if things look up first and they like me back, it is all going to go to shit eventually. i get my hopes up, they lose interest and i feel so fucking worthless. i guess i do not deserve those good moments.	not depression
the affects of having no family i have always been alone but it did not affect me this much until years ago, when at i became i will. after that i could no longer depend on just myself. and as a result my family tore me apart. i should have recovered by now but i am sti will stuck in this stupid loop of being unwell. i do not have friends anymore and i do not have any hobbies that i can do or that i even enjoy doing. i like things but not getting that satisfaction from it really sucks because i can not use it as a thistraction. i missed out on a lot of normal teenager stuff like hs, prom, hanging out with friends, driving, relationships because of being i will but also because i had a family that preyed upon that instead of supporting me and helping me to get better. i just do not know what to do anymore. the future seems too bleak.	not depression
when i see other people having fun i get weirdly sad when i go on snapchat and stuff and see that everyone goes out every weekend it always makes me feel bad about myself and makes me feel like i do not do enough with my life. i literally had the thought process off if everyone gets quarantined then i would not have to feel bad about not going out. i also have a friend who like does something every weekend and has a large number of friends so i always feel inadequate compared to her and it seriously wi will ruin my mood. does anyone else get this?	not depression
i keep staring at my phone i look at it as though i wi will magically get a message from you. but i would not. you have no way to contact me and i have no right to expect anything from you. i hurt you in more ways that i thought i could ever hurt a person and there is absolutely no way i can come back from that. so i wi will keep looking at this goddamned phone, knowing i broke us. knowing that i can never take back anything i said or did. knowing that you hate me and have made everyone hate me with you. and i deserve it.	not depression
i can not shake the sinking feeling that i wi will never know what happiness actually feels like. 	not depression
tired of feeling unloved. no matter what, friends or family. my soul knows they love me, but i just can not believe it. one bad argument, one angry word and it all crumbles in my mind. any relationship i try to form with a guy fails because he never loves me enough to give me a title. yet, they string me along because i am convenient and i am always there. i realize i suffer from something serious. i do not have any close friends, they are always using me to vent because i am good at emotional support. i feel alone. i am tired of being the strong one, the one nobody suspects is suffering deeply inside. the one everyone always runs to, but gets ridiculed or blown off when i need the same treatment. i hate the way my face looks to other people. i am frustrated and angry because i can not cry anymore. my throat feels tense. i do not know how much longer i can do this. i apologize in advance for the i ammense negativity this post is.	not depression
corona is ruining lives as if normal days are not bad enough, now there is corona everywhere, schools shut down for weeks, a boba place asked me for a interview but i could not go, i can not go to the gym plus it is raining. i do not know what to do staying home all day.	not depression
i have not done anything today i just took today as a wash and have been in bed with my cat the entire ti ame, napping on and off. sort of feels like a sick day. i have not done this in months, but had a really weird night and it is gross outside. i do not know. that is okay every now and then, right? everyone says get outside for a bit today, you ll feel better but i just want to do nothing. no cost, no consequence. i do not know. is that okay?	not depression
i feel like no one cares i do not feel like anyone cares about me, i am always expecting my friends to abandon me, i do not trust anyone, and i can not connect to people anymore. whenever someone says something nice to me i think they are just saying it to be polite or that they want something.	not depression
there is a virus spreading around the world, but i have made no effort to keep myself germ free like other people. the title is not supposed to make me sound cool or anything for not caring about this virus. i am not cool. i am just tired. i do not have the capacity to care anymore. i have not been necessarily worried because i am just not. i do not always wash my hands or anything when i am shoveling stale chips and stuff into my mouth. i keep my food separate from the rest of my family is as a courtesy. i do not always get out of my bed to clean up on my days off, and might only stir a few ti ames to get food or whatever. i am not even sleeping. i just do not have the wi will to get up and do anything. i am reasonably healthy, but it feels physically draining to get up and do things some days, even if i am well rested. if i were to get sick, it would be because i do not have the wi will to take care of myself most days. and i would probably deserve that. i am just tired of trying at this point.	not depression

advice regarding a friend please???? very concerned advice regarding a friend please hello reddit, i hope this is allowed. a friend f of mine f is going in a downwards spiral, she is very vulnerable and i do not want to upset her without sounding rude. she is not taking good care of herself, using a fair amount of drugs, not eating much, by the sounds of it not sleeping either, joking about dying and sharing depressing suicidal things on social media. i remember her as such a happy and bubbly person which was up until her and i got into a friendship with a very toxic person which did numbers on us both at seperate ti ames but i think because she had no support like i did with having no one to talk to i did offer to talk to her but we weren t very familiar of each other at the ti ame that it really traumatised her a lot. recently we have become a lot closer and seeing this from an outside perspective there is so much i want to do to help but i do not want to push her away or upset her, i just want to see some changes and i want to see her taking care of herself. it is scaring me a lot to be honest. i know it is not my responsibility to help her to change and that she should not be relying on me, i know it is all within our own power to change. but it is just getting a bit out of control, i feel like if i speak up about it it wi will scare her away, so all i have been doing so far is checking up on her every day or so, asking how she is, inviting her over for girls days like doing face masks and makeup, days out with my partner and child, even just days out with us two someti ames. we re both into spirituality so we talk about that a bit, i get a bit of my knowledge from her too. i try to get her out of her four walls as much as possible get some sunlight and make sure she is eating enough. it is difficult to help her because she does not open up as much yet i know some of what is going on for her because it shows. i do not want to pry into her private life unless she tells me or asks for advice. i would much prefer her to come to me with her problems as i feel like it is not my place at all to just go ahead and ask or say something. what i am asking is, how do i approach this situation? am i doing the right thing by asking for help? am i doing the right thing by including her in activities? should i be straight with her? as a friend how do i raise my concerns about the way she is treating herself? how can i be a good friend be there for her? how can i guide her in the right path? i hope these are the right questions to ask and i hope that was enough. thank you very much for taking the ti ame to read. tldr i have a friend who is not taking care of herself physically and mentally. what can i do to help without prying?	not depression

wondering how people can just be happy and content i have been struggling with these downward emotions since i was probably a pre teen but it is definitely gotten worse in the last few years. it is difficult for me to make keep friends because i am seen as too intense, or too dramatic or i ruin it by constantly thinking i am annoying them or they wi will get sick of me. when people say they do care or we are friends i often do not believe them. i constantly feel alone and broken. i started seeing a therapist who suggested i see a psychiatrist because he believes i have depression. i can not say i thisagree but i have also tried prozac, lexapro, and am currently on zoloft and nothing seems to help i smoke occasionally which someti ames helps until my deeper emotions come out and then i just go into a deeper spiral. i am also married to the man i have been with for years. he says he loves me, and tries to show it in his own way. but i need constant affection and attention and compli aments which is hard for hi am, and i am sure exhausting to deal with all the ti ame. he also works an opposite shift so we often only see each other couple days a week. i constantly feel like a failure as a mother. i try to hide the dark thoughts and emotions from my kids, but someti ames it is too much and i end up yelling more than i should. i do not want them to grow up and hate me but i also do not know what else to do. i would love to just run away, or drive off a cliff but i also can not bare to hurt them. i am not sure what to do anymore but i am constantly hurting. i hate myself and my life and wish someone would just hug me, tell me they love me and we wi will get through it together but that wi will never happen. how are people just happy and content with their life?	not depression
i am feeling a lot better lately so i posted to this reddit a few days ago wondering what is wrong with my life and what i have to do to fix it. i have spent these past days with my best friend since childhood and got to spend ti ame with two more friends of my close friends. this morning hi am and i did a pretty extreme session of workouts and we plan to continue it because our schools have closed down for a long ti ame due to the virus going around. i have had the idea of god on my mind a lot more lately. maybe i just needed a purpose and a little going back to my old ways to cure what i could only describe as a phase of depression. things are getting better, they surely are not but i feel so much happier when i spend ti ame with my good friends and get some ti ame away from my family, not that my family is bad of anything, they can just be stressful. i currently have little to no commitments due to the shutdown of things in my city because of the virus and all i have is ti ame, i thought my mental state would deteriorate vastly over this next break, but it is done quite the opposite, i feel so much better. i hope and believe it wi will continue going this way. i wi will continue praying and searching for answers of what i can do to fix my mental state even more and search for answers of what i can do to find myself truly happy. i have been visiting my psychologist more lately too and that helps me find those answers. i also think i might have some form of ocd which debilitates me from ti ame to ti ame but i have never been diagnosed or really even talked to anyone about it besides my mom so i do not know? if you have any comments of suggestions they would be much appreciated. feel free to reach out to me in the comments or direct message. i am thinking about trying church out again too, tomorrow morning i plan on visiting a close friend of mine who is in the hospital and is not ever going to recover from his injury, he has been in a vegetative state for years and i just go to be supportive to an extent so do not worry to much about it but hopefully it wi will put me at rest a little more.	not depression

i am lost need help and explanation my bf best friend boyfriend is depress and is really good at hiding it. he almost never takes anything seriously and always jokes around. but we have a lot of serious heartfelt talks. we usually see each other every night and spend most of his days off together. recently there has been a change with his work schedule which made us not see each other for more than a week. during his days off we only saw each other once...he asked me to spend the night when i was leaving but i can not because of my work schedule and with life at home. after that, he is been thistant for the whole week and kept saying he needs space. and i keep leaving hi am alone and giving hi am space but now he can not give me at least one day to see hi am and kept saying he wants to be alone...he is been ignoring my messages and calls as well. i know he was stressed the last ti ame we saw each other. however, i do not know if he is going through something and if i should just leave, because honestly it is been hurting me too how he is been treating me this week... this is my first ever post. i do not really know how these things work. please be nice, i just really need help and clarifications...thanks in advance!	not depression
any quotes mantras philosophies that help you through a hard ti ame? personally, i have got two that i use these days. . nothing changes if nothing changes ie. if you want different result you must try different methods. this is helpful to remind me that initial thiscomfort shouldnt prevent me from trying new things . the lesson repeats until you learn ie. our problems are ours to overcome. also feels nice to think of the universe patiently waiting for me to learn anyone else have something like this?	not depression
i can not physically speak someti ames weird post but i was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to fix this. or has experienced anything like this as i have had such a hard ti ame explaining this to other people. a lot has happened over the past six months which has been a little too much to handle. this paired with anxiety thisorder and the sheer loneliness of university i feel like i have forgotten how to talk to people. but this feels a step further then social anxiety. i now speak so quietly and softly i can not hear myself and the words are jumbled so inthistinguishably. i often stutter which makes me retort back into my shell. it feels like there is some kind of cognitive barrier between my thoughts and my speech. it comes in waves, with days worse than others. i never used to be like this. i applied for cbt but was denied and i do not have a lot of money. i have been trying to get back on to antidepressants but the waiting list for my uni doctors a month. i feel stuck.	not depression
communicating is hard i do not why it is so hard for me to respond to texts, when i am feeling bad. i guess this is what it means when people say that depression takes away your friends and family. lol. the thing is, i have been working on a lot of self healing and even though i know that recovery is a linear process, i feel like i am focused on a ti ame frame. it is like i would not get there when people are constantly thistracting me and asking me to do stuff. i feel remorse about it someti ames, but i really just need to pay attention to myself right now. if people hate me for my thistance, even after i have told them what i am going through, well that is on them.	not depression
i can not stop screaming why wi will not anyone talk to me???	not depression
somethings odd about this world it does not make much sense to me right now. to repeat the same things over and over again, that we all speak the same ideas with different words. ideas of forming habits to become better, or of love, or of seeing the positive. because in reality, it all leads back here, does not it? right back into sadness, right back into pain. its said we all need a balance of emotions. happiness can not be appreciated without sadness... i often get caught in my thinking alot. we all do, perhaps, maybe like me trying to think of the meaning to this world. the only meaning it has is what we give it. but everyone is meaning is different. makes it only our meaning, almost meaningless, because it makes all other meanings redundant, including our own. perhaps i am a over thinker in thistress. ive lived in the lights and the goods of this world. ive been out of this state. so then why? why am i forced to question all? i know the light and dark of this world, but what does that all mean? nothing about this makes sense, its all so odd... reality inst so fun is it? or is that pessi amism? but then what makes something opti amistic? whouldnt they both be bad? because pessi amism and opti amistic views are both wrong if you fully take them on. wouldnt that mean realism is the best? then why is people talk about life being so terrible. if realism is meant to see both sides then why are people so dumb as to say its terrible, when its both, good and bad. god what is happening right now to me. does anyone else get like this? perhaps this might be more anxiety than depression. hell i dont know. i get more depressed at the fact lifes more complicated than it is picking my side on how to live it.	not depression

from an abused kid to an abandoned teenager to a zombie. i was always a happy dude running a day and taking a day off and going to the gym on that day, i was working as a freelancer and studying, learning everything i can learn, i was going good, but this is the side that i control. on the other side, i always had problems with my father, i am done with hi am for years now, we never spoke and he sees me only from far away someti ames, he does not deserve any less than that, when i was a kid he always humiliated me and the rest of our family, and i thiscovered that he gives birth to me just so i can take care of hi am when he grows old when i was , when he knew that he lost all hope to get me back he started thinking about ways to get me out of the home without turning everyone against hi am, after all, i know he wants them to take care of hi am when he is older, but he could not find a way so i went away, ti ames actually, i was renting in other places, but my mom did not let me, and she kept saying that i should go back home at less ti will i get , i returned home in both ti ames, but the sunrise is that someday i heard my mom talking to hi am and he was like always trying to get me out of home, and my mom arguing hi am, and i eard her relly clear, saying that i have menthal heath problems and i am crazy. i never really cared about what my dad says but i cared about what she said, she betrayed me. i was homeless for some ti ame we in morrocco do not have a savings account created for us or any money because all i made in freelancing i spent it on clothing and gym and other tech accessories, and it takes ti ame to find rent so the first or nights you got to be homeless, also we have no homeless shelters, you re all on your own. i had too many bad experiences in my life, i can not really count anymore, but all of that could not move me, i was sti will happy, i had dreams, i am working on them, healthy, going to the gym and running i can say i was in all things i do . but all of that changed after, one day i was thinking about all my life all my struggling, all of that if it happened to another person i am mostly talking about people that can not fight, for example, people that can not protect themselves , my dad stopped beating me after years old, it is not because he wanted, it is because he was afraid of me, my body had almost the same or more muscles than hi am, and i was not the scurry dude at all if he attached it would end up bad for hi am, and i was also thinking about other problems in the streets in other places, the life is just full of danger and problems, then i started thinking that it is better if died as a kid before suffering all of that, but why as a kid, i better not be born at the first place, that would have been the best thing ever. then i take a decision to never have kids and to have surgery as soon as i can, note my decisions are not like everyone else, i was always doing what i wanted no matter what it wi will cost me, i misaligned my spine to prove that . at that moment, that exact moment while i am finally the years old virgin, i never had a girlfriend before or even a kiss, i never really tried because girl in morrocco are just playing games and i am not a boy to play, decided that i wi will never have kids and i guess get married too it is just my theory because our brain does anything to guarantee we survive and we give birth, genetics is all about that . after less than weeks i started unexpectedly thinking, to what end, why i am i fighting at the first place, and i started thinking about all the good out there, but it was not really something i wanted, i wanted nothing but to end this life, i know there is a problem with me but why, i was good before and suddenly after deciding that i wi will never have kids, i turned into a dead man, then i found out that the only reason that the mind or we are alive for is to keep this wheel running, but i stopped and my bin knows me if i said no it is no and there is nothing that can change it. you might think who is this crazy guy, well i am not crazy and i have no mental health issues before weeks, i am a web developer entrepreneur just a small startup , both jobs need intelligent and i can not do them if i am crazy, but the problem i do not want that anymore, i do not care anymore, i have no point to live for, i have no dreams, no goals, nothing that i want and i do not have and that is is a problem because i did not lose hope, i do not have anything called hope anymore, i am just a living zombie.	not depression
i amagine you re driving down a long, dark, road... i amagine you re driving down a dark, long highway. you re hungry and tired, and the car is small so you re cramped and uncomfortable. you re unable to change lanes no matter how hard you try, and you can not get a chance to pull over just to take a break. eventually, you find that your lane and only your lane suddenly stops, dropping off into a massive pit that would surely ki will you. you can not change lanes, so your own choice is to either keep driving and fall straight into the hole, or stop and cause the traffic behind you to pile up, angering the other drivers. that is what living in this world feels like.	not depression

right as my depression lifted and i was getting ready to change things and get out more, the coronavirus hits and everyone has to self isolate and for who knows how long. people are getting sick and dying, the medical system is going to crumble, i probably would not be able to get surgery to relieve my chronic pain at this point for that reason, and i am stuck inside this house. right as things started looking up and i was excited that i was going to finally even be pain free again, all my hopes were crushed. i have a feeling i am going to slip into depression again. anyone else feeling this way?	not depression

i am such a piece of shit my sisters never visit my mom, my brother openly, thisgustingly, and vulgarly hates my mom, and i feel like i am not good enough ever since my mother lost my baby brother, and turned back into an alcoholic. he is now living with his father who is abusive, and my mother already has a history with them, so the odds are rigged against her. she was drunk tonight and annoying me, and i have been holding things in for a long ti ame, and tonight my mom literally spoiled me. when we got home with the groceries i dropped a bottle of vinegar and broke it and i reached my breaking point i flipped out. i was screaming, yelling, pacing, and when i sat down in the recliner, she playfully slapped my foot trying to cheer me up, and walked into the kitchen. i flipped out again and swore at her. i called her an annoying drunk, and she walked back in with the saddest look on her face. i am mediately regretted it and broke down crying and started hugging her she said it is ok but i know her and she thinks that everybody hates her and think she is a piece of shit already. so this probably just added to that she went to sleep probably thinking that i hate her, knowing her. that is not what i think it all i love her with all my heart breaks my heart she thinks this way. me and my sisters and my baby brother love her so much and she just does not see it what can i do.	not depression

i was high. what can i say? so this is what i wrote whilst stoned on cannabis i share with you something that have complexed and swamped my mind for years. what is life with happiness? happiness is defined as the state of being happy. , but what does happy mean? happy is defined as feeling or showing pleasure or contentment. . showing pleasure? but how is pleasure shown? what is pleasure ? why is it the fundamental lining of life itself? why is it the one thing we desire the most but fail to gain successfully? pleasure is expressed and described as the way our brain expresses enjoyment, excitement and exploration. therefore, most addictions are caused by pleasure. surely then life is an addictions since it is caused and causes pleasure? with this theorem, i can give you an answer to the truly unanswerable question, what is life? . my answer, life is an addiction which causes pleasure amongst its beings. life is not alive and has no achievable goal. it is purely a means of giving meaning to other beings. by not having pleasure or happiness , you are si amply a being without meaning. therefore, you should make everything pleasurable and express everything as happiness because life is an addiction that can not be overcome. therefore, it must be controlled. 	not depression

i do not feel like myself anymore i do not think i am depressed, but i figured this subreddit would be the best place to post this. i am a freshman in high school right now and i feel so damn lost. i used to have a therapist to help me, i talked to hi am about stuff, but i stopped talking to hi am in th grade and now my parents are dealing with stuff. my brother is autistic, and he is non verbal. he requires a lot of attention, he is broken holes in walls at our home, he is scared guests away which makes me unable to host events from our house, he screams constantly and makes it hard for me to think, and it feels like he is constantly angry. i do not want my parents to focus their attention on me because they have already got a lot to worry about themselves, but i do not feel right. i have to take care of my brother in the future and i do not know if i wi will be able to take care of hi am and live my life normally. my mom moved to america when she was young, and became extremely successful, and now she wants the same for me. i told her about my dream job, and she basically told me that she wanted me to do something that would make more money. i do not want to thisappoint her, but i also do not agree with her that work can not be fun. i think that work can be fun, and that there is more to life than money. my grades went up from all b is and one c in the final quarter of th grade to all a is and one b , but it feels like i am studying for nothing. what are grades going to do? get me a better job? get me more money? what am i even going to do with that money! i can buy stuff, but i would not buy happiness. there is no object that can fix what i am feeling. the only use for money is allowing me to live in a safer neighborhood, giving my kids if i can even have them since i am taking care of someone already a better future, or donating it to people who need it. not to mention having no school for weeks is making me feel bored, which makes me want to amount to something, but i do not know what! i used to think the future would be awesome when i was younger, but now it looks horrible, i am scared of it.	not depression

i am sick of it i am sick of no one loving me, i am sick of being the one person in the friendship group everyone forgets about, i am sick of listening to music too loud and giving myself tinitus but i can not stop no one in my real life even takes me seriously. listening to it at high volumes is like an addiction. i am so sick so sick of it all. it feels like everyone is moving but i am just stuck. all my friends have relationships but no ones ever told me they loved me in that way my whole life. i do not know what is wrong with me. i can not even fathom the thought of kissing someone never mind having sex with anyone like my friends are talking about. i find it hard to have platonic physical contact with my friends never mind romantically. one of my friends who i low key hate but i can not get rid of her has got so many people asking her out it is insane. she is so obnoxious but she is really loud so i guess people notice her therefore someone wi will like her. the more extroverted you are the more people wi will like you. i have no chance. this friend is also so self centred. she always thinks her problems are more i amportant than anyone else is just because she is poor not the kind of poor that you do not have food, just working class and that no matter what your going through she has it worse. she said this to my other friend, whose family member is terminally i will. none of us knew this at the ti ame, but it just shows that you never know what goes on in someone is life, even if they have more money than you. i also said honestly to her once that i have never felt so bad as i have these past few months in my entire life , and she replied with i have it worse because insert problem i am doing ok in school but the pressure and worry is always there. and then after school? what wi will i do after? wi will i sti will be a sad hermit who sti will does not go out to parties in fear of embarrassing themselves? wi will i go to university? wi will i get a job? wi will i be a year old virgin, if i even make it that far? wi will my parents be dead? oh god. i do not know if this is depression this feeling i have had for what or months i have never felt this sad and alone in my life. i do not know what happened. nothing really changed. a family member i had not seen in years died, but it did not really affect me.	not depression

i just remembered a life defining moment it was first grade. award ceremony for numerous things. i do not remember what the award was for, but it did not matter. one by one my classmates were called up. they all started gathering on the stage. i sat there on the floor, crisscross applesauce, thinking almost ti ame to get up my name was never called. i sat there in a empty space of the floor, crying in shame. it felt like all eyes were on me. my mother was probably thisappointed since then. that day, it should have sunk in that i was never going to amount to anything. just like before, all i can do is sit here and cry. the only difference is now i am begging to die.	not depression
i just do not know anymore i have been thinking i do not know what the real me is. am i the happy mellow guy or am i actually just this depressed silent person. i do not know the real me. no one i talk to knows what i go through. how hard i work not to cut for their sake. how hard i try to pull myself out of this hole only to be dragged right back down in minutes. theses people say they care, but do not bat an eye as they watch you fall. is it really worth all this effort i put in for them	not depression
every year, i look less forward to my birthday so today yesterday was my birthday. my family got me a birthday cake like they do every year, sung me the happy birthday song and i blew off the candles. but to be honest, i would have rather they did not, because at this point i have come to almost despise my birthday. what is the point of celebrating years of existing in this pitiful world, especially seeing as every year gets worse than the previous one? i know that there are people in this sub that do not get wishes or presents or cake on their birthday and feel really bad about it. well i wish i could switch positions with you. that way, both you and me would be satisfied. sorry if i come off as arrogant or ungrateful, it was not my intention.	not depression

my friend is going through a hard ti ame, i feel so powerless. i have recovered from some big mental health issues myself, but i am realising that even if i give perfect words of encouragement or places to go for help.... i am sti will at the mercy of how their emotions make them feel. i know that good words can be twisted by the depression monster. of course they would day that, they are lying to make me feel better .... perhaps i am worse than they can help .... there is nothing that can make this go away it hurts me so much that i can not do anything to take this pain away. nothing i could do to change the nastiness our brains can throw when we are unwell. someti ames it feels like the emotions wi will never pass and no one can fix you. these are such awful lies depression tells us. i know it wi will get better and i know it is a fucking awful battle to get there. friend i promise i wi will be there for you. i wi will sit with you whilst you cry or panic and i would not judge you for it. it is a part of life and treatments get better every day. you are not alone and you never wi will be. death is only the end of the opportunity to get better, takes away the love and experiences you can feel. you reading this probably have several people that only want your happiness. and i promise you they would not judge you for how long it takes. this monster is cruel to you and wi will make you feel like everyone is against you, but it is not you.. it is the i willness. you wi will get better and i wi will be with you no matter how you are during this journey. i wi will sit by you sobbing and i wi will treat you just as i would if you were happy. nothing can change how much you mean to me. depression does not make you any less of such an amazing friend. depression does not make you any less amazing in my eyes. i only look forward to your smiles. you wi will smile again. even if you do not i wi will sti will love you.	not depression
i am done loving my mom. fucking done. so today was my birthday. i got up early and took and shower and got ready nicely for once and thought that today would be an actually good day. my mom and i went to eat lunch at a nice deli and got home at about . she told me that in a bit we d go to the mall and she would let me pick out some stuff that i wanted and that we d go out to eat and that i would be able to invite some friends over. i ended up watching tiktok for a long ti ame and suddenly it was . i go out to look for my mom and she is asleep in the car and would not listen to anything i say. at she came inside and told me that she would go get some nice clothes on and that we d leave in a few minutes. ti ame goes by. i have on a nice sweater and jeans and jewellery and i am just waiting. rolls around and i am starting to give up because the mall closes at and lots of my friends can not leave for anywhere after . i started crying and went to ask my mom if we could go. she told me that it was too late and that it was my fault for not getting anything done soon enough. i told her that it was her fault and she calls me a bitch and tells me to go fuck myself and so i slammed my door and threw my shoes that i have had on for an hour waiting for her at the door and she comes in her and beats me with the fucking shoe and tells me that i am a worthless brat and do not deserve love, ti ame with her, or a happy birthday and then she leaves and shuts the door and then opens it again just to slam it. if anything has made me feel more worthless or want to ki will myself its this. i called around my friend group crying and told them that all birthday plans were cancelled. this happens all the ti ame. i do not see my mom as a mom anymore. fuck my life.	not depression
boyfriend just called me lazy.... he is seen me struggle at my absolute worst for the last months.... he is seen me pull myself up and do everything i can to get myself better.... he does not know what it is like, and i am glad because i do not want hi am to experience this invisible i willness. but my jaw hangs open right now. i have known he thinks it but he finally said it out loud and i am too numb to argue or explain or do anything but let tears slowly fall down my cheeks. he sees me in bed all day while i am not at work and struggle to make myself food or go grocery shopping or shower as lazy. i have made it to the gym every day for a week and i have been crazy proud of myself, but i am sti will lazy to hi am. he does not understand and i can not make hi am.	not depression
are you responsible for your own hurting? is it me or does anyone else always blame themselves for getting hurt by other people? i always try to reason why a person hurt me, where that person was coming from and how something i did might have led them to do what they did and hurt me. while that makes me less angry with people, it makes me feel ashamed and pathetic.	not depression

pessi amistic pains i do not know if i am a good guy or influence for my crush she is talking back to me and we re flirting so you d think that i would be happy right? no i seem to make the worst out of every scenario no matter how positive i try to be. i am just this toxic boring lonely mess and she is a fucking beautiful smart talented girl. she is waaaay outta my league and i am just stunned that she actually has any interest in me. it blows my mind how some fucking failure of a person like me can kinda hit it off with a girl like this. i doubt that anyone would treat her better than me. what i do know is that others can provide more for her than me and have more ti ame on their hands. more money, intelligence, talent, funnier. just more than me. it is making me sad that my crush likes me yeah i am actually this stupid. i know that you guys are rolling your eyes over this complaining idiot who seems to be doing well in life but my mind just drags me down. i want to cry	not depression
i felt better for a few months now i am worse than ever it is never worth it. you put your heart into things, into people and it is never worth it. i do not think i wi will end my life but each day it makes a little more sense, you know? it seemed absurd once. then i could see how someone could do that. now it almost seems like a good idea. i can not because of my family. i was unhappy cause i could not get a job, did not have money, had too much ti ame i spent sleeping and depressed. now i have a job and it is not that bad but i sti will hate it. life is suffering whatever way you look at it. it is like my sinapses align once in a while and i just think i am done. finish the show. bow out and then i snap out of it. then i feel like i am performing my depression. hey, i am actually in control. i wouldn t harm myself, right. right? i hate this.	not depression

i was thinking of maxing out two credit cards to buy a gaming laptop that i could game on and stream games with while i play in hopes of making money or getting money in the process from people watching my streams. thing is i have no one interested in me and figured it would be too hard to get pretty popular in gaming streaming at this ti ame and day in age since there are so many out there who are huge into it and have thousands of followers and make a full ti ame living out of it. would be hard for a dead beat like me to do that. i just hate living on thisability being in debt and having no other source of income other than my dollars a month. i just can not keep doing it anymore. i wish i had a few hundred more a month to live on if i could clear extra a month i wouldn t lose my thisability and it would help me big ti ame financially.	not depression
you re worth it if you re browsing this sub, feeling bad about yourself, or if you re searching for people who understand you, or if you re just mindlessly scrolling, just stop for a moment. take this as a sign. you re okay. depression is so hard to battle. if you have the energy, do one of these things . go and get a glass of water . walk around your house for a moment, stretch your legs . message an old friend for a catch up . write all your feelings down in a journal you are worth recovery. you re worth the little things, like waking up to the sun and a fresh breeze, finding a joke that you genuinely laugh at, the possibility of meeting new people and getting better. because you wi will get better. this is all part of recovery, and you can do it. this is a sign to carry on, if you need one. you re loved, wanted, valued, needed.	not depression

a novel realisation i was watching this national geographic docu not too long ago. they were monitoring this group of monkeys with a robot babymonkey that had a camera hidden inside it. one of the monkeys grabbed the fake baby to take care of it but in its fervour dropped it by accident. the robot was built only to move the camera, and not to be able to get up so it just lay there. the group of monkeys seemed to think this was a baby monkey that just died. without knowing the baby monkey or where it even came from they instinctively started mourning. it had a big i ampact on them. when i die i wi will at the very least have the few remaining people around me experience this instinctive apebrain sense of loss regardless of any factors. i wi will at least have had some kind of i ampact, though hollow and meaningless the origin of the i ampact may be. biology wi will at least make my death be slightly less meaningless. too bad only then wi will people start thinking that they care. would be a little too late.	not depression

is anyone out there? i am sorry if this seems preachy but i felt like i needed to make this thread, at least for my own personal sake.. i dont want sympathy or pity. i dont want any more medications to make me feel better. i dont want to keep a smile on anymore while everyone around me has a frown and acts like i dont have any feelings i just want a friend who occasionally cares about how i feel. i am tired of being everyones second or third choice, the constant butt of the joke and the one that no one would dare hang out with after i spend all my ti ame making other people happy and going out of my way to make sure my friends are in a good position. i can not take it anymore. i can not help these feelings that i have and i dont see a point of living anymore. its clear i wasnt put on the earth for any sort of happiness or joy because its a constant drain to have everyone in my life take that happiness away from me and making me an after thought. so fine, i wi will go through with it and maybe at my funeral everyone can pretend like they actually cared about my feelings and wanted to see how i was doing. sure, let them pretend like i mattered to anyone. i am sorry, i know this is a si willy post. i am just in a really bad headspace right now and i just want to know if theres a single person who knows or even cares i exist. i just dont want to feel like such a failure anymore and i dont know what to do. i just wish i mattered. even a little bit.	not depression

got to love isolation. hey everyone, so i travel for work, i have been on the road the last months, staying in hotels at least a week away from home at a ti ame. and it has really taken a toll on my mental health, my depression has taken a massive hit, and i genuinely feel like nothing is worth it anymore, for instance i used to love baseball and softball, i sti will play softball but i just do not find the enjoyment out of it anymore that i used to. among other things like music, writing, etc. i have not been on a date in two years, i had a woman not too long ago when i walked up to her, she looked me up and down, said ew and walked away, kind of laughing. no joke. every woman i talk to either ghosts me, views me as a friend, or does not see me in that way. and that is genuinely the only thing i have ever wanted out of life, is a beautiful wife and kids, but if i can not even get a text back or anything, then that might as well be long gone. and any woman that does find me attractive i wi will honestly never pick up on it because of all the ghosting and everything i just assume that whenever i am even carrying on a conversation, whether it be small talk or in depth, she is already thrown up at the thought of being with me. so i just never act or seize the moment to try and flirt ya know? and all my friends are getting into relationships and asking me why i have not found anyone yet and my usual response is you let me know when you find out, because i sure as hell can not. i go out of my way for my friends and whenever they are upset, suicidal, manic, or just need help i am there for them regardless, but the moment i try to say anything to them asking for help, i just get a same or left on read. or just blatantly ignored. which has genuinely brought me to the conclusion that i deserve all the shit and depression and everything that is happened to me. and is happening to me. i was a very religious man at one point and kind of fell off track, but i pray every night, and feel like there is absolutely no hope for anything to ever be close to how it was. and all of my ex is are engaged or long term happy relationships, and i am happy for them, i really am, i am glad they found someone they love forever. just kind of wish that were me or i could get that. i just feel like i am a fi willer person in life you know? meant to get them from one person to the next, like a phase, just never meant to be permanent just for plot holes or plot development. i honestly do not know how much longer and more i can take.	not depression
 real heroes do not project their insecurities on others in the past months, i have been going through rough patches. i am picking up the pieces, like i have been doing for years. but lately, i have been hearing comments that resonate in my heart. my mother had a fight with my stepdad, due to his depressive episode, and he has been projecting his emotions on her. it was taking her down. i have asked her if it was bothering her when i was having my episodes. she said no, you stay in your room and interiorize yourself. i do not have to go through it with you . i know, it is not necessarily better for me to do that, but i do not want to hurt anyone else when i am like this. today, my bestfriend had a fight with her boyfriend and he basically was doing the same thing. she told me i have known you for years, and you never used me as an anchor to take me down so you could swi am. i am guilty of being weak, but...people like you are real heroes. it brings me to tears, to hear those words. i am not trying to depict them as bad people, both of them are really nice people, who have a hard ti ame processing their emotions. but hearing that all this ti ame, my greatest fear of being a weight, being weak, being judged... are all false... it only brings me hope.	not depression

i have given up any hope of ever feeling good again all i can hope for is to feel less bad. but that wi will never happen because all that is left of me is the pain and the only way to get rid of the pain is to get rid of me, and i am too much of a coward to do it. so instead i am just going to spend the rest of my unfortunately long life in agony waiting for the day i die.	not depression

love and sadness let me start with i am in love with my fianc . i love her very much. i just recently proposed and everything. i can tell she cares about me but she is very grumpy and angry all of the ti ame. when i try to have fun with her and play with her she is just pissy. it upsets me bc i want to have fun with my love, but it makes it really hard. it makes me sad when she acts like this. i can not talk to her about it bc if i even tried, she would somehow flip it on me, as if i am doing something wrong. i love her, i just wish she could see that i am trying hard to express my love. i know i can be a lot to handle. i am very energetic and can be kind of up in your face. that is just how i am though. i do not know, maybe that is how i am and that is how she is. we just have to find out middle ground i suppose. i do not know, it is all just a lot and it feels like i try hard and then get rejected.	not depression

just how i am feeling rn. i have been thinking about writing in this sub for a few months now, and everyti ame i am about to write something, i bottle it and back out of the app. not even sure why i want to write in here. maybe i am lonely, maybe it is the only place i can speak freely. i have been signed off from work since before christmas with depression and anxiety, honestly, i am not going back. i can not face it. problem is i am and now face the embarrassment of having to move back in with my parents. they have been great with what i am going through but i have not been fully letting on just how much of a hole i feel like i am in. i think about ki willing myself everyday, someti ames in depth, someti ames just a fleeting thought. i think i would have done if it was not for family members being left behind to pick up the pieces. i have written this and deleted it numerous ti ames. not even sure what i am expecting. probably just needed to get this off my chest to at least somewhere? thanks for your ti ame.	not depression

okay around friends but awful on my own i am an introvert but i have some close friends who is presence i really appreciate. it is like being around them helps thistract me from how i am really feeling and for a short while life feels liveable. they have really been my crutch this year and i guarantee i wouldn t be here without them. but the minute we part ways and stop talking my reality crashes back down on me and i feel terrible. but with covid hitting my country i feel like mass self isolation is just around the corner. i know that when it comes to this situation i am more of a danger to myself than this virus is to me. of course i would follow any guidance put in place to protect others though . and i have technically finished my last year of uni, just have exams left now. but that means i need to move to the opposite end of the country and i am terrified i would not see them again.	not depression
no life left in me i just go to a job i hate then come home and sleep i miss being myself. i used to draw. i used to run. i have gained a lot of weight, which i have mostly come to terms with because i no longer think being beautiful is that i amportant. but i just want to fucking run, to feel my body doing something positive to itself for a change instead of hating itself or cutting itself. i miss how good it felt to run until i was out of breath. i miss how fun it was to create with art. i can not do it though i can not i am broken as fuck my mind does not make ideas for art anymore and i have realized it is because i do not have a soul, really, because ofc a person with no life in them would have nothing to give creatively. can not pull from an empty well and i can not run i try i try i put on my gym clothes and i was so happy and i drove i drove there you guys then i just.... drove back. that is happened the last three ti ames i tried i miss music i miss music so much. last couple of ti ames i bought concert tickets i ended up not going. one i drove and i broke down in the car crying so i drove back. the other few i just could not get up to go. i used to go all the ti ame and i have not now in years which is unusual for me but i have no one that likes my type of music so i always went alone but now it is just so hard the weight of doing it alone and being so lonely is so hard i have nothing in me it is all gone and i can not get it back even when i shower and put on my strong face and drive to the gym and i try to reach for my strength it is not there why am i living ? i just want to run and feel and draw and dance	not depression
the feeling of biting a pi willow while you re crying so no one hears you... ... is something i am getting used to at this point. i do not know where it all went wrong. i finished high school in the top of my school and got into one of the most prestigious programs at the biggest university in my country. the management and international business co op specialist program at the university of toronto, canada . and it is as if that is when life felt like i had been given too much happiness. i was sharp, social, fit, and cheerful. now i am the opposite. over the last years in university, things have been getting worse and worse for me and i saw myself slowing down, gaining weight, and just losing interest in things i used to love doing. the root of my problems are my parents. they are about years older than myself i am and they are in their s. result of late adoption . i am the only child and my parents refuse third party help. i am pretty much dealing with their aging on my own, while also doing university and working part ti ame. i switched out of the prestigious program to take care of my parents, because it required about months of studying and working abroad in order to graduate. the generational gap creates a lot of problems. they get irritated and yell at me all the ti ame over trivial things, they pick my insecurities apart, thereby destroying my confidence, and they pretty much speak to me in insults or sarcasm. i do not have many friends as a result of constant moving during crucial friendship development windows in my childhood. the friends i do have are either going to different universities with different priorities nothing wrong with that , or they are at my university but we re swamped with work. i do not mingle with my co workers on a personal level either. the only thing i really had going for me, is my relationship with my bf that started in first year. the past few months have been shit, with my parents getting worse at home, bf is more stressed over uni and consequently getting more irritated, and i am just caught in the middle of all this. this past week, the coronavirus shut down my university and workplace, and is forcing me to stay home to protect my elderly and sickly parents from the slightest chance of exposure to it. now i am getting a constant inflow of sarcastic comments, insults, and yelling from my parents, with no escape. i have not seen my bf in nearly a week and he is also been busy stressed so he has not been able to talk much. i just feel like he is tired of me after exploding over text tonight. i do not know what is happening. i feel like every ti ame things are starting to look up, life comes and destroys it. after months of trying, i finally got a job offer for a nice bank position starting this summer, but i was offered right at the beginning of this coronavirus shit and the hr manager has not even been able to send my official offer letter yet. given the likely recession, i do not even know if i have a job waiting anymore. i have no idea why i am posting this here. with everyone getting irritated with me, i just feel like i no longer have anyone to engage with. i might have set my bf off the edge tonight with a few stupid frustration induced replies to something he did that annoyed me. i do not even know if i have a relationship anymore. my parents are slowly dying and at years old, i have to deal with this alone. i am trying to finish my studies and get a good paying job to support myself when they do pass away, but university and everything is closed indefinitely and my new job that would have started my career path is probably gone because of the recession. it is am est and i am just biting a pi willow while crying so no one hears me.	not depression
me i want to learn something new my brain be a pro or do not do it. it happens all the ti ame. i know everything takes ti ame. i know i have to spend ti ame everyday to learn. i know great things are not instant. but i have this thought all the ti ame wandering in my head and it makes me feel so bad. you are wasting your ti ame trying to achieve something. you are going to fail at it no matter what you do. is this anxiety? or i am just inmature? i am . in this case i am trying to learn to program in c just as a personal goal. i study history at university . i know the basics but i can not get anything done because i stop before making progress. it is not that i do not like it. i love it but have this problem. any help or comment is very appreciated.	not depression
i hate my body more than anything when i get stressed, i eat. when i eat i get stressed. and when i eat i get fatter. this vicious cycle has caused me to give up on trying to take care of myself. who cares when i am going to die someday anyway. what is funny is i am actually underweight too. i fucking hate my body, i hate my life, and i am ready to get hit by a train.	not depression
i can not feel content i feel so empty everything i do leaves me with no satisfaction why do i feel this way. i have goals long term and short i have friends and family who care for me but i just never feel genuinely happy no matter what i do	not depression
life is getting worse day by day... i just want to write it down somewhere... it all started more than years ago. i was happy, at least i think i was. i was confident, did not look like shit, had quite a few friends, lots of activities, a girlfriend that i lived with, did not have a high paying job but i liked the place. life was great apart from my girlfriend cheating on me a couple of ti ames one ti ame it was purely emotional cheating , other ti ame a drunk kiss , nothing too bad, right? easy to forgive and move on. well... you sti will have to cry a lot, hear out a lot of apologies, make a decision which you have already made because you re madly in love. but you have to at least pretend that you re comprehending the whole situation and thinking about leaving her, so she knows the risk. in fact you re not thinking about anything. you have already made your decision. life is going to suck for several weeks, months, you ll have some trust issues but you you ll get through this, right? right. for a while everything seems fine amp wonderful. seems like everything is back to normal, storm is over. but it is different, weather is not so sunny like it used to. you sti will feel loved and you sti will love her but this stuff is sti will lingering in the back of your mind. you can hide it under your smile, under love and passion. but it is there. and it eats you from the inside whenever you re alone with your thoughts. until you get another hit right in your face. this one is different, this ti ame you are not the one who makes a decision. she is. and now she is playing this i got to think about everything , let us have a break game. she is already made her decision, there is nothing you can do and you know it. and deep down you know that her decision is the right one. you have to get rid of the trash one day, it is been piling up for years. but it sti will makes you feel dreaded amp hurt, it is been years after all. fucking years. it is been years since all of this happened and now i think that this emotional mess was sti will better than my life now. i miss her, i miss having someone besides me, even if the love is fake , even if something is happening behind your back. i miss hugging someone at the end of a stressful day, i miss feeling safe, even if this feeling is just an i willusion. life has changed a lot during these years i made an incredible career, i have lost some friends but i sti will have a couple, tried dating and i was not too successful. i gained some weight not obese in any way, just overweight , lost all of my confidence, now i am not as extroverted as i used to be, i am sti will assertive amp confident in my work environment which contributed greatly in my career but i am pretty shy in any other social environment, i started smoking and i really hate who i am now. and i am trying to change it. i started going to the gym, did not stick to the schedule at first. i relied on my gym buddy too much probably, did not want to go alone. started over after a break of months, going alone now and i really started liking it. well apart from feeling lonely all the ti ame. either way, covid comes, town is in quarantine, gym is closed. always getting into some kind of obstacle. at least this obstacle is the real one. either way, during these years maybe even years , i was feeling worse and worse each day. the life seems to go nowhere. i have nothing and no one and i honestly do not even believe that it is going to change. i am staying alone most of the ti ame, i want to do something, i want to have friends, to be between people. i want to find new hobbies, new activities, be more positive, outgoing, confident. it seems to be so easy to everyone but not for me. i occasionally see people having first dates in a restaurants, couples going through the aisle of the supermarket while holding each other is hands. i miss those things. i miss my old self. nobody likes my current self, even i do not. and i probably can not even expect other people to like me. but one day, quite recently, i woke up in the morning feeling... different. for the first ti ame in years i had a positive outlook, i felt confident. it seemed like it is all going to be well for me. it was like jumping from one really cloudy amp sad universe to the one that is sunny. needless to say, it did not last longer than a day. if it lasted longer, i wouldn t be writing this terrible post here... i do not know what to do. i do not know how to change. i do not know how to find these bits of old me in my brain. i just do not know. and on top of that, i decided to check out my ex gf on social media. when we broke up, her new guy was not the best looking guy in the world and now he has posted pictures from the gym where he is fucking ripped. he progressed forward with his life and now i look at myself in a hypothetical mirror. and i am sti will depressed piece of shit, stuck in ti ame since years ago. wi will something change? or i wi will have to live miserably for god knows how many years, sti will being stuck in when my life took a degree turn? or maybe i am making the progress? just that the progress is more depression. i do not know. it scares me to think that this is my life now, and it wi will be like this... forever. i have no idea what i am expecting from you guys by writing this post. i just hope that at least one or two people wi will read it, maybe someone wi will be able to recognize themselves in my story. i would like to know how your life turned out. sorry if there are grammatical mistakes here, i unfortunately do not have energy to proof read it right now. just wanted to get my thoughts out in the wild.	not depression
i am just so exhausted. so this weekend, i had people come in to visit for my daughter is birthday. people being my mother and my ex. i spent friday and saturday getting chewed out for not keeping things as clean as they should be. i also have been sleeping on my couch, as my mother is using my bed. my mother also let my kitten out after i said not to open the windows. that was friday morning. it is now am on sunday and she is not back, and i have been a wreck about it. i live out in the woods where there are many bigger ani amals including coyotes, and it is also been cold and rainy. so today was the birthday party, and i stood the whole ti ame while my daughter was surrounded by everyone else, and was the one handing everyone things because i had to stand in the kitchen. after eating i had to clean up and since it was at my fathers house, i had to go through a bunch of my stuff that is sti will there, while my daughter played upstairs. my daughter is going to visit her grandparents a few states away for a couple weeks, so it wi will be just me. i do not really have friends that can come visit, and i do not have a job right now. i am in a rough spot	not depression
that moment when you actually feel an emotion intensely. i have been numb for so long i forgot how powerful emotions can be. i just recently i i felt a non diluted wave of sadness, that almost made me kind of appreciate my depression. because that sadness was intense. however some ti ame last year i experienced non diluted happiness which made me loathe my depression even more. its crazy to me how i used to experience emotions at that level and not feel weird. now every ti ame it happens it is like a novelty experience.	not depression
my friend needs help and i only have so long until i get pushed away this is going to be crossposted to multiple mental health subs fyi a friend of mine who is always been very open with me faceti amed me recently and i am very worried about her. she is obsessed with a guy who is told her in the past that he likes her, but lately he is only been talking to her so he can keep fucking her. she told me she is only happy when he acknowledges hi am, and that is becoming less and less frequent. she is never been a very serious person, and so as soon as i try to step in and help i can almost guarantee i am going to get pushed away in lt a week. she is also high from the second she wakes up until she goes to bed, so nothing i say wi will be taken to heart. i have two concerns she is going to hurt herself suicide is unlikely . as she told me that she hurt herself for the first ti ame a couple weeks ago. she is going to move onto more dangerous drugs. i have no chance of getting her off weed, but if i can keep her from switching to a more dangerous drug, and make her happier, that is a win. she does not have a good relationship with her parents, and i do not know them well either, so going through them is not really viable. she has a sister, but her sister does not like her much and that is not from her point of view, i have seen it in person . her friends are all weed smokers and partiers. i myself have never done a single drug gone to a single party, and really the only reason we re sti will friends is because we both used to be mildly depressed, and we think each other is nice funny. she refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem she should get over the guy, and i do not think the guy cares about her much, so going to hi am is not really an option. she is really athletic and so is almost never busy, and her parents are semi anti medicine, so therapyy meds is not an option. i am all out of ideas, but i am really concerned for her. any help is much appreciated.	not depression
dear friend somehow, i have been happy for days straight, and i am starting to think depression is not the default. do not want to break my record. if you feel even a bit bad about me or anything please tell me and be honest and let us resolve our problems, ok? i feel the purest i have in a long ti ame, and i want all my friends to feel the same. i know what it is like to hurt, i know what it is like to not be accepted, i know what it is like to hate myself and everyone else, i know what is it is like to want to escape everything, i know the burning urge you may have at certain ti ames, and i want you to talk to me whenever your brain is a mess. whenever you re upset and do not know why, whenever you re upset and you do not want to tell people why. i have no bias. i have no qualms, but my one rule is do not waste your ti ame on the past. you must realise we are living now. fight the freezing feeling of not knowing what to do. take a moment to breath. it may feel like the world is collapsing around you, but it is not. close your eyes and visualise all the ti ames someone is said i love you and how you knew they meant it. feel it all around you. you are loved and you wi will always have a place in this world. always. even if you re living on the streets, even if all your friends have left you, even if you think you re a parasite to your family and friends, even if you re crashing on your friends couch. the ones that really love you, or have really loved you at one point, they always think about you. even if it is just a random thought because they saw something you might like, even if it is because they read something that ryhmed with your name, or because someone brought you up, you always have a place in someone is heart. you are not alone. i think about you. i am always free to talk. i am trying to be the most open minded, universal, buddhist super man, but no one is perfect. no one even comes close, but you re perfect to someone.	not depression
i feel awful i am f. i am in college. growing up, i was very shy. i had untreated social anxiety thisorder that really got in the way of my ability to make friends, have a boyfriend as a teenager, and that sort of stuff. i finally got therapy and medication when i was and i overcame it thankfully. now i feel like i probably have depression. i feel like my brain just can not ever let me be fully mentally healthy and happy, something always has to be wrong with it. last semester of college was the closest i have ever felt to truly happy and mentally healthy. i had just transferred to a new college, i made a lot of new friends, joined a sorority, i had my first boyfriend. i just was having a really good life. then my boyfriend dumped me, my friend group dynamic changed some, i got used to the college so even though i sti will really like it it does not have that exciting new feel anymore. i started to get depressed. i think a lot had to do with getting dumped. he really led me on and played with my emotions then dumped me and it was hard on me. especially because i go to a small college so i have to see hi am around. and every ti ame i see people post pictures with hi am my heart just sinks. i did not like my class schedule that much. i started sleeping a lot and not eating very well or very much. i have always struggled with my self esteem and feeling like people like me, especially guys, and so i guess once i felt like this one guy did not anymore it did hurt my self esteem deep down and it just did not help my already deteriorating mental state. i started to feel really sad and hopeless. and that is where i am today, sti will feeling that way off and on. i have good and bad days, but today has been a bad day. any advice? i am on an ssri but it is mainly used to treat social anxiety thisorder and ocd so i was thinking i might need it switched.	not depression
someti ames i just sit there and think of all the ti ames i fuck up. how there is something wrong with me and i just sit there. knowing that nothing wi will change, knowing that i can be better, wishing that i could fit in. not be such a fucking moron. i think i am too comfortable, everyti ame something good happens. i fuck it up.	not depression

anyone else want what they can not have? i want to be the next generation defining nba legend, the mj, lebron, the kobe, of my generation and i am wi willing to put in the work because basketball is the love of my life, and at ti ames it is like heroin to me. there is nothing in this world besides my love for the game that i wouldn t sacrifice to achieve this dream of mine i would wi willingly sacrifice any family, friends, lovers, in order to achieve this. but talent does not allow me to do so. i am not feet and i am not athletic at all. my game is all ski will, but ski will only gets you so far. i want to be rich, to spend my life hooping and outside of hoops i want to game out and use my status as an athlete to promote my content, i want all the perks of wealth, and i want to eat really good food everyday and use my wealth to start a restaurant. i want to get away from all the people i know now and get the sweetest revenge by coming out as the top dog and living a life others could dream of. i want to be the best at what i do, and i am not going to be humble about it in front of the people from my past like my family and friends that all doubted me. but no. i do not understand why i can not have that, why i have to live in a world where everyday is really just one big chore and i survive by trying to chase a dream that might not even happen. i survive based on little moments, i survive based on hope, i survive because i fear the boredom of dying. they call me a pessi amist but i am the ulti amate opti amist i truly want to die yet i am forcing myself to stay alive. basketball, working out, and video games are all drugs to me i act like an addict on withdrawal without those. i cope everyday, besides those, by watching porn, stress eating, and writing stuff. at this point, i am living life only to be happy and only for my happiness.	not depression
one wish true death i have a good family. i realise that i am blessed with all the things i wi will ever need and am in a position that is only a dream for many people in the world. my family loves me and i love them very much too. but at the same ti ame, if i was given one wish i would ask for a true death what i mean by true death? where i am erased from existence. all the traces of my existence are erased from everybody is memory so that no one who cares for me or loves me wi will ever be sad. no rebirth or other lives and all those stuff. though i realise that there are people who value me, i just want to go away have any of you guys felt i have had enough of this life man.... . do not want want anything. just want everything to stop and leave me alone. feel i bring thisaster with my actions and always hurt the ones that i love. never feel that i can satisfy what others expect of me, thought their expectations are very reasonable and is no way something that is beyond me or anything. just thisappear..... wanted to express my pent up thoughts somewhere.	not depression

found out my ex cheated on me. i have been in a particularly bad low right now, i struggle with motivation to do si ample things like shower, or brush my teeth. i have had suicidal thoughts, not anything serious but sti will. so i came in contact with one of my exes. at the ti ame when she broke up with me she said, i have to work on myself sorry. over text tonight i asked for closure on why she broke up with me. it turns out her and her friend were going to another guys house, and because she did not want to cheat on me, broke up with me over text. i was completely blindsided originally when it happened, but i got over it. now, knowing the real reason she broke up with me, has sparked thoughts about self worth, my attractiveness in general, and my existence. i feel like with the break from school for the next few weeks, i might not be ok. i just want a reset button.	not depression
can not see a good reason for life i thought about it so long and always tried to work for a goal or a reason, but now i can not find it. why living further? for a good job, i tried a few but since my cognitive power decrease and i can hardly remember things. i can not bring the performance anymore, like i used to. i am not good at what i am doing, even when i put effort in it and have good days. it bothers me so much to know i am getting dumb . kids and partner. i dont want to marry, i am shaped through my parents marriage and bad relationships. i have confirmed hard trust issues and close to get social anxiety. so since my early childhood i knew i never want to end like my mom in a marriage. i tried to change this view as a teenager, but i saw to many examples that it wi will be always end like this. so no marriage and partner. i dont find joy in my hobbies and nature anymore. i just sitting on a bench and dont feel, even when it is beautiful. i am bad at my hobbies because i didnt developed them further. for friendship, at some point they always drift apart and i also dont feel anything when i am arround them. i just act like i used to but i am empty. and either way, people wi will leave because they have their own goals. i experienced it with some. i went to therapy to fix it and i could see a light. i got back on track after years down. i got a jobtraining, went out with friends again and got a good living routine. i thought hey, this is it. but while i was in the job training i realised. i have what others have, a good life, but do i like that. work, home, friends and hobbys. no i sti will do not feel anything, jt scares me to know i wi will work to certain age, while i am bad at it through the decrease, i wi will mostly be one of the bad worker. i wi will always stay in the shadow. i wi will always be alone. when i fail my job i probably can not hold my flat. my family wi will talk bad about me. even my favorite tv shows and games cheer me up. if i fail my job training i wi will end that all, i feel so certain about it like never before. i am scared about the pain, but i feel very calm and good about the outcome. even when i successful go through it i am not sure i want to life, there is always this lonley future ahead. a tv show said, just live like everyone, but i can not see how this is good. should i life a bad life so just the people around me are happy and i am not. why should i live a miserable life with no reason, so i can hole for a breadcrum here and there after a while. that doesnt sound like living. i rather die in peace then living like this.	not depression
i hate to be myself yeah i hate myself more than the anything not because am guilty or anything i just i hate to fact that am not good enough , am a loser ,weak and ugly it is like living in a body of person you hate most , when i look to the mirror i only see reflection of my foolish dumb exsistence and that ugly body . i am sick of being in the body of this person . no one loves hi am , he doesnt have a girlfriend , he doesnt have a career why i had to be hi am ? wish i was someone else , i just dont want to be this person anymore ...	not depression
very long. maybe too personal. but it is my truth. i used to think there were many things i would take to my grave, but for the first ti ame in my life, i feel like i need to open up and talk about my feelings. i do not want you to pity me or send me heartfelt messages. i just want to be heard clearly. more i amportantly, i hope that if my words resonate with you, you ll take this moment to either help someone you know or seek help for yourself... deep breaths. calm my racing heart. alright. the feelings i have towards my parents are complicated. if they were shitty people in all aspects of their lives, i wouldn t feel guilty about hating them. however, they carry traits i admire, and there are many positive things they have done, not just for me but also for others. that is why i have a difficult ti ame accepting my negative feelings for them. at ti ames, it feels inappropriate for me to hate them, but other ti ames, i feel like that is the only way i am capable of feeling towards them. for the majority of my life, but specifically the entirety of my childhood and youth, my dad was an alcoholic who would, on occasion, hit my mom while he was drunk. at that ti ame, i was very young and i was sti will an only child. it did not matter to me that my dad was working while attending a competitive university. i did not care that he was struggling to balance his work life, academic life, and family life, all while dealing with the emotional strain that our financial situation caused. i did not care about how my dad was also struggling in his own way, but only hated hi am for how he treated my mom. my dad is also the type to move on from things quickly, whereas my mom holds grudges. so after hitting her, my dad would act like nothing happened the following day. this cycle was something that deeply angered not only my mom but also me. my mom worked she sti will works full ti ame as a registered nurse. she makes more money than my dad. i often wondered why that did not give her the confidence to defend herself without crying, but then again, i wi will never know the pain of being coerced into an arranged marriage and having to move to another country to be with my husband, leaving my family behind in my native country. i think there was a lot of sadness in my mom is heart during the early years of her marriage as well as raising me. she got married at . my dad was . they had me three years into their marriage i was born in . when i think of my childhood, there is something in particular that always comes to mind. it happened multiple ti ames back when my mom worked night shifts. she would hide my dad is alcohol and tell me not to tell hi am where it was. i agreed. however, once she left for work, my dad would approach me, all smiles. he asked me where his alcohol was. i told hi am i could not say. then, he said that he would buy me whatever i wanted. like an idiot, i agreed. every ti ame. my dad never remembered the promises he made to me once he was sober again. almost years later, i can not help but shiver at how naive i was... as a kid, i did not eat much. two reasons one, i was not fussy. i never complained about being hungry, so other than getting fed when my mom was home, i did not really eat. you know how when you re a kid, your parents usually force you to eat? it is like that. because i never complained about being hungry, my mom would feed me si amply because it was ti ame to eat , but when she was not home, there was no one to feed me. the second reason i did not eat much is precisely that. my dad never checked on me when my mom left for work in the evening. i passed the ti ame by watching tv, and someti ames i fell asleep early. but one ti ame, i got bored and went upstairs to see what my dad was doing. he spent so much ti ame on his computer, and he never even spared one look at me after i gave hi am his alcohol. so, that day, maybe i was looking for an answer. i stood outside my dad is room and looked inside. he was drinking a beer, looking at something on the computer. that much was not shocking. but i was completely confused by what i saw on the screen. looking back, even if i had seen it clearly, i wouldn t have known what it was. i was too young then. but the second my dad noticed me, he closed quickly the tab. he rushed me out of his office and locked the door after going back inside. i did not realize it was porn until i was in my late teens. it sti will haunts me to this day. i remember i went back to my room after that and i thought i would seen a thisney princess on the screen or something. i got excited thinking maybe my dad was looking up a doll or something to buy for me. why was i like that...? there was another episode that occurred when i was six years old. by then, i developed a habit of staying in my room even though i knew my parents were fighting. i heard multiple voices from my room. it sounded like my grandpa was coaxing my dad. my maternal grandparents lived with us at that ti ame because my mom had gotten pregnant unexpectedly . my dad was very irritated and angry during her entire pregnancy. i do not really know why, but that day, i stepped out of my room and peeked into my parents bedroom where all the adults were gathered. my grandpa was pulling my dad is hand back. my mom had her hands around her throat, coughing drily. without a word, i went back to my room. my mom came into my room a few minutes later and locked the door. she spent a long ti ame crying. i do not think i wi will ever forget that feeling. pathetic, helpless... something like that. but i do not know if those thoughts were directed at myself or my mom. however, the dynamics of our relationships all changed by the ti ame i was a teenager. during my adolescence, my relationship with my parents turned very sour, especially with my mom. up until th grade, i did well in school. i had mainly as and bs. however, in th grade, i got my first c. it was in science. but there is something i need to explain before i go further. as i said, my mom is a nurse. my dad is a clinical laboratory scientist. both of those careers have a lot to do with science, and my parents were also really studious growing up. one could argue that it is because they are indian, but i think that is just their personality a result of their upbringing. they both work hard and never slacked off at school. my maternal grandma was a housewife. she got married at and did not have much of an education, but she sti will pushed my mom to study well so she could have a good career in the future. my dad came from a broken home. his mom died of ovarian cancer when he was , and his dad was an alcoholic who spent his ti ame gambling. my dad was very close to his mom and loathed his dad for neglecting his parental duties. i always found this funny since my dad thisplayed a lot of behaviors si amilar to his dad when i was young, but whatever... since my dad has five siblings, there was even less money to go around. sti will, somehow, my paternal grandfather managed to send all of his kids to america. now, they all have good lives and good incomes. they were only able to come here and acquire a good job with the degrees they earned in india through hard work. it is because of this that my parents do not take school lightly. in america, k is free if you go to public school. in india, school is expensive at all ages. in kerala, many kids start school at age three, and they begin learning three languages at the beginning of grade school. the education there is also much more difficult and at a higher level than what is taught during k in america. the reason why i want to emphasize this goes back to what i said previously. i got my first c in th grade, and i was an anxious wreck when i went to show my mom my grade report. we had to have a parent sign it and then bring it back to school . because my parents schooling was much more difficult and competitive than what i was dealing with, i knew beforehand that my parents wouldn t be able easily to accept my first bad grade. i was right. i never got that grade up either. i ended up graduating from th grade with that c, and i had a feeling that things would only get worse from there. i was right. in th grade, i failed two classes biology and geometry. after that, my grades were mainly cs and ds. i only got as in useless classes like pe and extracurriculars. my parents constantly degraded me because i was a thisappointment. since i was not doing good in school, they could not brag about me to our relatives. nothing that happened in our home stayed within our home either, so the concern that i might not graduate high school quickly spread among our relatives. because i did poorly in school, i felt inferior when i was around my family. due to my upbringing, i have always had a fearful avoidant approach to relationships, which means i constantly switch from wanting to be accepted by my parents and wanting them to treat me as if i do not exist. since i can not raise my voice at them or tell them how i feel, i ended up having a lot of internal conflicts and could not cope properly with the things my parents said to me. as a result, i just stopped talking to them. although we lived in the same house, i acted as if they were ghosts that i could not see. my parents can handle yelling but they can not deal with being ignored, and because i could not be honest and tell my parents how i felt during that ti ame that i felt like i did not fit into our family because my ideals were different from theirs, that i believed there were more i amportant things than school and grades all i could do was show my anger through silence. but silence can always be misinterpreted... my lack of reaction to everything around me caused a lot of issues in my family. i even got caught by my parents while i was on shrooms when i was actually, i should not say caught since i told them i was on drugs during a bad trip anxiety attack totally my fault for taking an eighth at once, never happened again . but this happened at a bad ti ame. i did not have many birthday parties growing up, so my parents wanted to hold a sweet birthday party for me. this was merely a performative party for my parents to pretend like our family was not on the verge of breaking. i did not want a party for that exact reason, but it sti will happened. it was only a month later that i was caught on drugs, and it caused an even bigger rift between my parents and i. they lost all trust in me, but honestly, i lost my trust in them too. i can not remember many of the things i told them when i was tripping out, but i know for a fact i told my parents i felt depressed, and i remember exactly what my mom said in response what do you have to be depressed about? i wish i could have told her, right. you telling me that you wish i was not born is not something that should affect me after all... after this incident, they took off the doorknob on the door for my room, i was not allowed to be alone, and they wouldn t let me sit alone with my sister because they thought i would contaminate her or something. for this reason, i thought being at school was sti will better than suffocating at home in that tense, judgemental, depressing environment. my father had bouts of explosive anger during my high school years. of course, they were all caused by me. on my th birthday, i came home from school and felt very odd. my dad picked me up but i do not remember what happened during the car ride. once we entered the house, i think he went straight to bed. he worked night shifts and would sleep after picking my sister and me up from school my mom had switched to day shifts a long ti ame ago . i went upstairs to my room. as i looked around, my face felt very hot all of a sudden. most of my things were gone. aside from heavy furniture, my belongings were nowhere to be seen. all i saw was a white letter folded on my desk. it was my progress report for that quarter. all ds. my dad is handwriting was underneath. people tend to forget things that shock them too greatly, so i do not remember exactly what that letter said, but it was something like, you re now. we do not have to take care of you. if you do not graduate high school and go to college, we ll kick you out. i got so angry that i cried. only a few weeks before this, my parents and i had already talked about my future. i told them i wanted to be a tattoo artist and that i wouldn t waste money by going to college. i mentioned that there were people i knew who could help me get started. they had not objected to anything when i told them either. i went on stupidly, believing that they accepted my choices. i thought maybe we had finally reached some kind of understanding. i realized once again that no one in my family cares about what i want. how i feel. my dreams for my future. unfortunately for me, at the end of the day, nothing mattered. i was financially dependent on my parents, and if i wanted to have a roof over my head, i had to live my life how they wanted me to. i started to think that maybe i was fated to always be controlled, and fated to always let myself be controlled. that very evening, on my th birthday, i applied to a community college in my city. my grades were shitty and i did not even know if i would graduate, so that was my only option. my parents did not give any reaction when they found out i had applied, but on my graduation day, their personality changed completely. since my grades were shit, i did not know if i would graduate until two or three weeks before the ceremony after grades were finalized . my senior class had close to , students, and i was ranked or something like that our school had around , students . it is kind of sad but also funny to think that even the people who barely knew me would say things like, nah, you look really smart. you probably have all as, to me whenever i said i was not doing good in class which was my usual response whenever someone asked me to help them with their work . this was another reason why i could never bring myself to ask teachers or classmates for help with my assignments. everyone assumed i did not need it, so i felt like i did not have the right to ask. anyway, as i was saying, my parents completely switched up on me after i graduated. i started college in the summer after graduating. i chose cri aminal justice as my major but changed it to psychology a year later. for the most part, my parents acted like the past never happened. they were suddenly very bright, very joyful, had no enmity towards me, and even joked about my high school days by the ti ame i was halfway through college i am currently in my rd year . i think that maybe that is the only way they can cope with how they treated me. maybe we re all secretly thinking of the mistakes we made and hating ourselves for it, but i have never been the type that can put on an act, which is why it is difficult for me to try and understand things from my parents point of view. to explain further on the financial dependency part... i did not get my first cellphone until i was . si amilarly, i did not get braces until i was . i considered both of these things luxuries, and i felt some bitterness towards my parents for not allowing me to have these things at a younger age. but i realized in college that there are more i amportant things in life. the reason my parents did not want to spend a lot of money on things that weren t needed was that they wanted to pay my college tuition in its entirety. if you did not know the salary of an rn and a cls, i wi will let you know that it is not small. but ulti amately, that is not my money, and i have never felt entitled to my parents money. i have never asked my parents for money like allowance or lunch money and usually alternated between the same outfits while i was in high school because i did not want to ask them for things and feel indebted later on. i guess you can say i am very much influenced by the american style of thinking that you should not leech off your parents after a certain age. but my parents mindset is not american at all in that regard. they told me that the reason they work and make money is so my sister and i can have easier lives. because my dad had to go to university in america even after getting a degree in india due to some courses not being transferrable , he knows the difficulty of paying off student loans. he paid his loans off in years because he has a good salary, but usually, it takes people much longer. as some of you know, a lot of students who go to year universities right out of high school end up close to k k in debt but only earn k k with their starting salaries. this makes it very difficult to pay off loans quickly because living expenses in america, especially southern california where we live , can be quite expensive. so, as you can probably tell, when i think about what my parents are doing for me in this regard making my life easier by eli aminating the possibility of me having debt in the future , i really hate myself for not being able to overlook the issues we had in the past. i can not bring myself to forget how my parents used to treat me, nor can i joke about that ti ame. for me, those years were full of repressed pain. i could not even tell my friends what went on in my house back then. yet, i also have a strong desire to succeed in life and make a lot of money so that i can give my parents back everything they have given me. in a sense, i want to eli aminate the indebted feeling i have towards them, and eventually cut all ties with them. as i mentioned before, i have always been a fearful avoidant person. i want love, but i also want to be forgotten. i want to be acknowledged by my parents, but at the same ti ame, i want to end our relationship as soon as i fulfi will my filial duties. my father had quit drinking many years ago and became a better man. i no longer have anything to hate hi am for, but at the same ti ame, i have many unresolved negative feelings towards hi am that have carried on from my childhood. and, as you can probably tell, no matter how much i hate d my parents in my heart, those words never left my lips. i never told my parents i hated them during the moments where i felt the truth of those words down to my core. si amilarly, i have never once told my parents that i love them. there were moments in my adulthood where i felt especially attached to my parents. just the thought of them leaving me or passing away made me tear up. but there was always a wall between us. i wanted them to love me, yet i did not want to tell them i loved them. i hated them, but i did not want them to hate me. i wanted to be close with them, where we could settle everything from the past and build a new relationship altogether, but i would always create space between us when i felt we got too close. i got so used to being misunderstood and mistreated that now i feel like it is unnatural and also i ampossible for us to have a healthy bond. i am almost now. i keep thinking about my parents and what they think of me. they treated me like shit when they thought i would amount to nothing, but as soon as i was attending college and university, they treated me as if i was precious. i felt like i was like an accessory for my parents something to show off, something to be proud of, and ulti amately, something that would change other people is opinions about them. if i was a failure, that would make them look bad. if i was successful, it would prove their competence as parents. i do not know... i just have many unresolved issues. it does not affect my ability to complete my day to day responsibilities school, work, chores, etc. , but i often lay awake at night and wonder why i am alive. can anyone relate to this?	not depression

friend so my friend is being extremely secretive and ever ti ame i ask hi am about it he would say something like do not worry about it. i asked hi am to day and he said he was not doing well and i asked what is up. he said he did not want to talk about it and i wanted hi am to tell me what was wrong. he did not want to so i said you need to talk about it he said no so i told hi am to promise me that he wouldn t do anything. he did not want to then stopped responding. was i being too forward and should i back off?	not depression

how do i help my friend? i am in college and my friend roommate let us call her m has pretty severe depression. last year before we lived together she was saying she was going to ki will her self and my other friend had to call the police on her because she could not get into the building that she lived in at the ti ame. the police just said she has no physical signs of harm so we can not do anything and then left. her parents do not believe in mental i willness and live on the other side of the country so they weren t much of a help. this year we live together and for a bit she started to get better then spiraled down again. she was crying on the floor saying she wanted to die and all i could do was sit with her and try and tell her to go to bed we were both drunk . she also has anger issues. her road rage is very scary because she screams in the car at other drivers and someti ames i am afraid someone is going to shoot at us when she does that because we do not live in the safest area. any ti ame something does not go her way she gets so angry and stomps around even in public. she uses her mental i willness to guilt me and our other friend roommate so that she can get exactly what she wants. i am afraid of making her angry because her anger can quickly turn to a panic attack and crying. she is on medication but does not go to counseling anymore. she has said she does not think counseling helps her. i have been very depressed before and seeing her breakdown and say she wants to ki will herself is starting to make me depressed again. i want to be a good friend but at the same ti ame i get extremely angry when she thinks her mental i willness is an excuse to boss me around get whatever she wants. i do not know how to handle this because i can not continue doing what i am doing because i feel myself starting to slip back into depression again.	not depression

i am extremely obsessed with my ex best friend. i need to just let go of hi am but i dont know how i am overwhelmingly obsessed with my ex best friend,, we stopped talking to each other about months ago and ever since my life is a mess. he truly was my soulmate. this is creepy and i know it but i anonymously stalk his twitter every single day. i can not help it. the obsession is insane. i felt so close to hi am that when we stopped talking i felt i lost half my life. ive realized i can not live the rest of my life thinking about hi am like i do now i wish i could make new friends and forget about hi am but i dont know how. my head is so full of hi am that i forgot about all other aspects of life like learning to make new friends or eating healthy or going to sleep early etc etc. this feels incredibly deteriorating. my brain hurts. the root of all my problems is my obsession with hi am and i feel i am going crazy. he seems to be doing fine now from what i have seen on his twitter. a part of my brain tells me that at this point he has already completely forgot about me this would be the most rational thing but the other part of my brain is telling me that he is just as obsessed with me even when we have not talked for months. it is like i try to find comfort thinking of the possibility we ll be as close as we used to be, someday. but after months i do not know if that can happen. i am so lost and confused and i can not do anything about it	not depression

i am consider my myself a negative outcome to society, and i am too afraid to ki will myself i wi will be honest first that i am drunk at the ti ame of this post, but i have been thinking about this for a while. but a long story short is i consider myself a failure. i was taught from a young age that we all need to be contributions to our society at large. and despite my efforts i utterly fail at that. starting from high school. i was a social stunt that tried to act cool but ended up alienated literally everyone because of how annoying i was. never invited to anything because my stupid self could not keep my mouth shut. i went to two different colleges. i am technically a senior but wi will not graduate for another two years. most of my classmates wi will, including one that graduated a year earlier. during my current college career, i tired to correct myself from high school and be more approachable. i failed at this completely as i came off as utterly creepy. this hurt me but i understand completely. i made them uncomfortable. it is my fault. i transferred to my nd college because of personal reasons. for once i finally made a group of friends but idk if they even are. most of them make fun of me in someti ames personal ways. not entirely their fault though. i have come to realize that i am stupid and stupid people say stupid things so they are right to shit on me. does not make it any better though. i am definitely in my group is punching bag but that is the best i can do to be social with others. finally, i chose to do a major that i am completely unqualified for. the fact that i only passed assignments that professors made easy and failed horribly as the actual exams shows km completely unqualified. i made a bunch of bad decisions that lead me here and i am only to blame for it. the only reason i would not ki will myself is because i do not want to be even more of a burden to my family than i am already am. i am also worried about the crisis on a possible afterlife, but that is a whole other story. that is why i am afraid of dying. tldr i consider myself a failure. the main reasons i have not ki willed myself is because of the burden i wi will place on my family and the fear of death itself.	not depression

my grandpa passed in front of my eyes. my grandpa was and he was not doing well and i was his care taker. i lived with hi am the last two weeks of his life and took care of hi am . he was my favorite person on this planet and i can not stop picturing his death in my head. this happened a few months ago but it sti will is on repeat in my mind. for about a month i blamed myself because i was the one who was taking care of hi am. he woke up around am with shortness of breath and being very cold. i put many blankets on hi am and helped hi am get more oxygen from another tank. while i was getting hi am the oxygen my grandma started calling but i told her it was not necessary and she hung up the phone. after minutes i realized this was not his normal pain he suffered at night and i called . the paramedics got there and started talking to hi am but he did not want to go to the hospital again he was and spent a good amount of ti ame there but after minutes of arguing with them i saw hi am have a stroke i think. the hospital could not tell me what it was but as soon as i saw hi am start shaking, i knew something terrible was happening. but i can not stop picturing that moment in my head. every ti ame i close my eyes i see that moment. i am just really scared that this wi will always happen to me. i just want to know if anyone has any advice on how to help me out, i am not sure what this is... i have never gone to see anyone about this or really told anyone about this but i was just hoping that some of y all could give me some advice.	not depression

depressed girlfriend wants to isolate herself hi, i have no idea if this is the right sub but i really hope so. some background info i am , year into a long thistance relationship with my girlfriend. we re both in our early to mid s. i most likely would not be able to see her again for a few months because of the corona virus. she lives in a toxic home and has both depression and an eating thisorder. she is had it for the whole ti ame during our relationship, but the three past months it has progressively gotten worse to the point were she is now suicidal everyday. i do my best to support her but i know i make mistakes someti ames. the problem two days or so ago she begged me to please let her isolate herself for a few weeks or so. she said she wanted to just be alone and think. i was a little hesitant and asked questions but wanted to respect her wishes. a few hours later she came home from finally visiting a mental health professional again, and she admitted something to me the isolation was a plan to make people stop loving her her words so that she could ki will herself easier in a month or so. she then begged me to do not let her ki will herself and do not let her isolate even if she says she wants to. she suggested that i could call her and talk ot her instead if she ever wants to isolate again. yesterday which was about days later, she said she wanted to isolate again. she made a video where she explained her reasoning behind it. she said that she is too sad to talk to anyone right now and that she wants to just think about what she has, what she is and start a journey with herself. something like that, i do not know how to summarize it. but well, she is begging me to please let her do this if she i love her. she said i promise to not to anything and we wi will meet in two months if the corona situation has gotten better, and we wi will travel together . she also said that she wi will text me good morning and good night every day so that i know she is there, and that i can send her texts and pictures but should not expect her to do the same or even answer. she said that she want to do this for a few week or even months. if the circumstances were different i would just respect her wishes without questioning them. but i am really scared that this is just another plan to ki will herself. even if it is not, i worry that her being almost totally isolated with just her toxic family wi will make her depression worse. and oh, her country is quarantined so she would not go to work or see any friends at all for at least weeks. i am really worried about her. she is saying i am going to isolate now, bye. talk to you soon again and things like that. she seems really determined but i do not know if i should let this happen because of what she said days ago. and now she just texted me please pray that nothing wi will happen to me . wtf this is giving me so much anxiety. i do not know what to do, i do not want her to ki will herself.	not depression

i desperately need help overcoming my procrastinating indiffenernce towards exams hello, this is my first post here and i did not actually know, where to post it. so if you know of a different subreddit that would fit better, please let me know. i have been struggling with depression for a long ti ame now. it is been a bit better lately, but i honestly do not know what do do anymore. so, here is the thing since i am a teenager i have always been kind of moody and grumpy, i prefered to be at home and do stuff on my pc, play videogames or read. while sti will in school i also had real bad insomnia, so whenever i had the chance, i would sleep til noon or longer. i was not a bad student tho. my grades were decent at their worst, i did not have to study too much, because i already lerned most of the things through paying attention in class alone. things like math i was forced to teach me ? sorry english is my second language myself long story but surfice it to say crappy teacher and because i was good at it, i thought other classmates friends. and i kind of just went along with my whole day life. i did what i had to do and that was that. then i graduated and for a long ti ame tried to figure out, what it was that i wanted to do with my life. and i finally found it. so now i am studying biology at university and i love it. i even found a circle of friends which does not come naturally to me . and now that i am on the way to where i want to be in life.....yet i do not do anything to remain on course. i know full well and i have always done this, but in school it worked out nontheless that i am a procrastinator. i wait to the last possible moment and do the most necessary things because i do not have ti ame to do more. which means i fail exams on a regular basis, because i did not study enough. and i do not know how to change my attitude towards it. working with rewards does not work, working with punishment like not doing something i like the next day or so does not work either. i get sort of apathetic and indifferent about the whole thing and i am like who cares? and fuck it and then i do not study. but the thing is, i know in my head full well what this means. and i am now at a point where i alsmost do not even sit down to study for anything! and this does not work! i want to study biology! i want to learn! there is so much i would like to learn languages, ski wills,... but i just do not do it. and i do not know what to do anymore. i know i can do it, there have been instances where i did it. does someone have an idea maybe? p.s. i was not diagnosed for the longest ti ame. and that was not something my family thought of testing me for depression . do not get me wrong, they are good people, they just thought i was lazy. so i only went to a therapist in december., and since i have to work for my money while studying and i am living alone i can only afford a therapist that has an agreement with my insurance, so my insurance wi will cover those expanses. but there are only a certain number of places who get these benefits, so i am sti will waiting for one.	not depression

 year old has gotten fired ti ames, told me he is a lost man , and is scaring me. however he sti will farts on people and acts foolish. i think this behavior is why he is where he is. i want to help hi am. help. hi guys, i am the older sister. my little brother is the most hilarious, kind, loved person i know. however he is also incredibly i ammature and has been coddled his whole life by my mom and dad. he is and going through a hard ti ame. he has gotten fired from five jobs in his career...and is currently unemployed yet again. while all his friends are lawyers, bankers, and have careers, he had to move in with my grandparents in the suburbs because he can not even afford rent! he literally spends hours watching reruns of shows instead of trying to get a job. he is constantly making fun of hi amself farting on my husband, flicking boogers at people, giving my friends wet wi willies and it is getting so old. i believe this all comes back to the fact that he is always making hi amself the class clown and has truly no self esteem and is constantly allowing people to speak down to hi am. last night i went off on hi am a bit after he farted on me and my husband i am also weeks pregnant and told hi am that he is too old, people roll their eyes at hi am because he sti will acts this way. he needs to get his life together and get serious about a career. he needs to stop watching tv shows and accepting the fact that my grandmother does his laundry. he needs to be ambitious and be worried about his lot in life. he told me i am a broken man. i am a lost person and i just want to give up . then he cried. in front of both of us. and left the room. i am so hurt for hi am. i woke up early am and he was already out of bed and working on things on his computer so that is a good sign. he always tells me i am the only person who he looks up to so everything i say really i ampacts hi am. does anyone know how i can mend this situation? what the next steps would be? i amportant to note since he is unemployed..he lost his insurance	not depression

well, i am sad again. heads up, this is just going to be a very long rant. like most people on this subreddit, i sh. i do not know why i do it. i think i decide to do it because it clears my mind, like having a little glass of wine. it focuses me. someti ames, when i am in school, i wi will feel myself about to cry, or not be able to breathe. i wi will go to the bathroom, try to cut myself, and come back feeling much more focused than i was before. for me, self harm is like a thistraction. someti ames, i wi will hear voices. i do not know if that is normal, and i really do not care. the voices feel like people sneaking up from behind me, and whispering in my ear. usually, they are the ones that tell me to cut myself, and i just go ahead and listen to them. they are really annoying, because they talk like they are their own people. i have heard that the schizophrenic hear voices, but i do not think i have voices to that extent. they just talk to me, tell me to ki will myself and other people. i do not know what to do about them. i go to school. life sucks there. i do not talk to anybody, because i can not open up. usually, i am the smart kid who always gets a is in everything. now, my grades are dropping, and people are telling me to pick myself up. i do not really want to. does it even matter? i am going to die eventually, so what is the point on wasting my short ti ame on learning to write a fucking check instead of doing the things i want to do? i tell people that, but i do not really do much of anything. all i do is go on the internet and write shitty poetry. i do not really consider it a hobby, because i do not feel good doing it. i have a family, but my relationship with them is not very good. usually, we barely talk to each other. when we do, it is usually arguments about my weight, or my grades, or who has to take the garbage out. i am usually on okay terms with everybody in my family except my mother. when she talks to me, usually it is to make a snarky comment about eating too much, or not doing anything. someti ames i can make her do my homework for me, i get an a, and everybody is happy with me, pretending i did something for myself. once, she caught me on these depression subreddits, and she slapped me across the face, told me to get my shit together, and played music while i audibly cried in the corner. i do not like living. it is fucked up, all of the terrible things that happen to everybody. war and cri ame and poverty and murder and depression and pollution and greed and sin and whatever the fuck. i made a date for when i want to do it, but i am scared. i do not want to die, but the voices tell me i have to and nobody seems to care. i want help but i do not want to go to the trouble of getting it. living does not even matter. but it is fine. thanks if you sat through all of this. back to life for me.	not depression

i tried to clean up, but i am losing motivation quickly. i know that probably sounds lazy. someone convinced me yesterday to try cleaning up, as i had not done so in a while, so i got out of bed this morning and did not get food for fear of falling back into the same routine. i have been listening to music, having a nice ti ame, and cleaning my room for an hour or two, but now i am losing the wi will to stand, let alone continue cleaning. this place really is a mess, and i am angry with myself for letting it get so bad. i was really looking forward to taking out all the garbage, doing some washing, and donating any clothes that i do not need because i am sure that somebody needs clothes right now. i also really like sorting things and having a system, but everything is a thisaster. i have taken out more things than i actually put back, and the only reason why i have not given up and gone back to bed is because my bed is covered in clothes and such right now. i would have to move it whether i was going to continue cleaning or not, or i would have to sleep on the floor. i hate that i am like this.	not depression
sick of the cycle of self pity, i want to be more i am sick of being croniclly apathetic, every weekend i tell myself i am going to get lots of shit done finally, there is stuff that needs to be done, i know it is a cause of my depression that it just keeps mounting and building, like a a horse standing on my chest that i keep feeding so it grows heavier. seriously there is so many things i should have done already. a good i willustration of this is i bought shelving at ikea four years ago, i gave it one attempt at setting them up, which failed so i shoved them back in the closet and i have not bothered since, what the fuck. that is four years and this is very low stakes. there are critical things i do not want to delve into details about. i am constantly berrating myself for being shit, while not doing a thing to fix it, i wallow on reddit and netflix, waaay too much tv and movies. i enjoy it..i think? i want to get off reddit, stop wasting my life and be a better person but i everyti ame i give it a go it lasts about an hour before i am mentally done, crawl back in bed where most of my tv watching is done and snuggle with the cat. i really thought i would be better at life	not depression

idea to help with panic attacks hey, i have a suggestion which helped me to deal with my panic attacks. my theory is that the muscle in the picture is very i amportant, i think it controls the amount of oxygen that gets to the brain. during a panic attack i start breathing more through my mouth so the muscle touches the backside of the throat and blocks the whole area above mouth from the absorbtion of oxygen . that results in gradual and temporary you have instincts which do not allow you to si amply suffocate loss of oxygen in the brain with most of the oxygen going to the spine which is made from the same neurons as the brain but in my opinion is responsible for processing input from your vision, hearing, etc. the downside is that it is not rational and if brain gets less oxygen it starts interpreting the signals from the spine body poorly making the body even more unstable. my idea is to keep the muscle in the i amage relaxed. that results in keeping both mouth and nose open for breathing and as the muscle is relaxed it can adapt and keep the balance of oxygen between brain and spine.	not depression

i got called a good person today, and it surprised me. f today i went out to get supplies for home, the workers who know me by name we re talking about how swamped they were so i brought in the grocery carts. at that same store a older chinese man i know locally who does not speak much english was in tears, scared but when he saw me he got me from a different isle to ask for help reading a sign. i have never had someone look so hesitant, or scared to ask me something. when he was leaving he patted my back, i do not drive and took a shopping cart to bring back my stuff and then brought it back. after visiting another store for cheap wine i sat outside to smoke a cig. i ended up holding doors, carrying laundry baskets for elderly people. a man called me a good person . i have been told this by friends, lovers, and some strangers but this hit me for some reason. i have been so scared of the cov but i have not stopped the little things i have always done. i have always done things like this, little acts to make someone feel better. but this was the first ti ame i realized i am a good person. this was the reason why people cry or get mad when they hear about my past, why people are surprised on how much self hatred i have or how much i wish i did not exist. i do not do these things for praise, but it felt nice that i could make someone else happy. maybe i am not like my father, maybe i can not change lives drastically or make the world a better place. but i like to think that these small acts could help someone who needs kindness. i sound like a idiot, as much as i hate myself ,i am opti amistic.	not depression

i am sorry to throw a tantrum like that but.. it is not fucking fair, none of it is. i did nothing to deserve this hell, it is not my fault who i am or how i was born. i wi will never be normal, never be free, never be given an equal chance, never experience what others so effortlessly do. i am so hurt, i have no one by my side, i hate who i am, i hate where i live, i hate my skin, i hate people in my life, i hate the thought of having to see another person. i am not cut out for this shit world, but i am too paralysed and weak to actually go through with ending it all and maybe preserve some dignity, rather than being this awful leech that everyone openly hates. i was given the right tools in life to prosper, this is not on me. i am going to ki will myself one day, it is a fact. i just hope something major happens soon to me that ll push me to a point where i have no other option but to die. soon, please let it be soon.	not depression
 hey, i heard you re going through something rough, can i come by and pick you up? said no fucking body ever. i guess it is wrong of me to expect people i consider close to me to care enough to make some form of contact when i am about to down a bottle of gummy vitamins and end my shit. at least i have siblings. i am sorry to those who do not. i love you if you re reading this.	not depression

i want to watch tv but i can not be bothered right now i do not even pay rent. i am not even an adult and i have not started the hard and long stretch of life. i do not even have to do anything, and yet i sti will feel like i can not cope. i am just in bed crying, binge eating unhealthy food, and listening to nightcore. i do not want to listen to the same song again. actually, right now i really want to watch this tv show, but i can not bring myself to stop doing nothing and log on to my laptop. besides, it wi will probably bore me and not be worth it. why waste my ti ame watching tv when i could be crying? i am panicking thinking about all the free ti ame i have wasted not doing stuff that wi will make me feel better like watching tv. i know tv sounds unproductive and a waste of ti ame but there are shows that i really want to watch. i am running out of ti ame. i honestly really want to od on some opiate in uni. that way i can experience the social life aspect of uni without having to worry about having responsibilities. i do not even know i am waiting til then, i do not like socialising now, what wi will change between now and then. i wish there were more accessable means of suicide that had mini amal pain for myself . i feel miserable everyday, i do not want to feel like this indefinitely. i do not have enough motivation to do things that might make me feel better. i am worried they would not even make me happy to be honest. i have been feeling this way for years, nothing has changed. i have had an online friend for almost years, but i wi will soon end our friendship. we were going to meet up at a convention this may, but my bmi is . and i do not think i am going to lose enough weight in ti ame. i know i wi will regret not doing this. i can not cope with this feeling of regret of all the things i should have done in the past to i amprove my life. like not get fat. i feel so guilty about all these things i have not done. but i sti will do not want to do them, i just want them not to matter any more. both my bioparents have schizophrenia and there is a chance i wi will inherit it, i do not want to live long enough to find out.	not depression

i am so tired of feeling this pressure to be exceptional i always dread long breaks bc i have nothing to do but reflect on myself and it just makes me so depressed and anxious. now that school is out for weeks covid quarantine march break i can already feel myself slipping into that mindset again. i literally go to bed at or am and wake up at pm. i have nothing to do, and no real passions or hobbies, and long breaks always just make me painfully aware that my life is literally so boring without school bc like... that is pretty much the only thing i am good at, which is so sad. and to make it even worse, i am terrified of being able to get into a good university next year i am a junior rn and i do not know what i am going to do if i do not. like, i need to get accepted in the first place, and then win scholarships so i do not fall into crippling debt, etc. there is always this pressure to achieve and it is gotten to the point where i do not want to achieve anything anymore. literally i feel so empty without any sort of purpose but i have no energy to find one for myself.	not depression
none of my friends actually care about me i rarely ever get asked if i want to hang out and on the rare occasions that i do, they always have some low effort lie like, haha sorry i have been so busy! like, it is okay. you do not have to lie. i can take it. i know you have not been busy for months straight. i see you hanging out with your other friends all the ti ame. you post about it all the ti ame. you re not inviting me to the things we used to do together and instead doing those things with others. i am just your backup acquaintance for when you re bored and no one else can hang out. if i thisappeared, or died, or moved away and we never saw each other ever again, you would probably only be moderately sad for like two days, maybe even less.	not depression

why are sunday is the hardest? for me, my depression always gets worse on a sunday. like do not get me wrong throughout the week it is generally just a numbness but it is more about getting through each day when i am at work etc. weekends are so quiet and empty. saturdays i can deal with because it is the first day of the weekend and i tend to just sleep rest then, but sundays are fi willed with silence and i feel more alone then, and it feels like there is a huge weight on my chest. i do not feel anxious for the week ahead, my job is what it is, i am good at it and i enjoy it. is it just me or does anyone else feel this?	not depression

help. a friend from college is suffering from depression and none of our friend group is near her. i am not sure if this is there right place to post this, but if it is not, can someone point me in the right direction? my college left for spring break about days ago. we we re supposed to go back today, but with the coronavirus, they have moved to online classes for the remainder of the semester. one of my friend told me this morning that she feels her depression has been getting worse. with all the isolation and social thistancing that has been called for in the past week, it makes sense. i live almost seven hours away from her, so there does not seem to be much that i can do to help. but if there is anything i can do, what could it be? thanks for any suggestions.	not depression

i do not usually post or comment on reddit, but this has been destroying me my whole life everyone around you is changing, getting a new life and new friends. and you yourself just... feel stuck in place. no, i am stuck in place. like everyone is just moving on, and you re chained to a pole. i have watched my classmates change and get older over several years, i can not recognize any of them at all! yet i feel like i am constantly the same, just darker inside. my best friend of my childhood ditched me and had a better life with other people. we were friends for over years. my second best friend from th grade just treated me like shit after an incident she was at fault at. my best friend from th to start of th grade just.. suddenly changed schools and we lost contact.. i literally have no friends. and why do i need friends? all my experiences with them are that i am boring no matter how hard i try to keep healing the bond. that om the one at fault, no matter the situation. that i wi will be left behind, no matter how si amilar we are. that everyone is moving on to a better life. i guess i si amply just am stuck to a pole, watching everyone go. and people wonder why i am bitter, aggressive, sad, thistancing and isolating... i have been broken too many ti ames, and can barely stop the bleeding wounds, let alone heal... you shout have done something with our friendship while you sti will could, so called bff . i am done.	not depression

for years i have felt i have been missing something. what is that something you might ask? well, it is that little spark that every normal person seems to have. that little flame that gives them a wi will to live, that drives their desires and goals. for years now i have felt like i was missing something. that i was not made quite right. i felt empty and for the longest ti ame i feared i was missing that little flame that brought people to life and fi willed them with passion. as ti ame went on i gradually lost interest in everything. i stopped asking for things on christmas and on my birthday. i stopped trying in school. i stopped thinking about the future and about my goals. i eventually came to know this as depression, which would continue on to utterly destroy my motivation and wi will to live. paired with being an awkard, introverted, loner made me feel even further an outcast. like i was the only one that was broken, watching everyone else living and accomplishing their goals so easily. skip forward a few years, past my only relationship that was not any good for me, and now here i am a year old male with no job stuck at home as a housekeeper for his parents that are never around. pile on all the responsibilities of taking care of a bunch of ani amals with a side of being in the middle of no where and you have the perfect recipe for feeling stuck. stuck out on the edges of a tiny town with nothing to do, no where to go, and no one to talk to. stuck in my head feeling that every day has been exactly the same since th grade highschool. i have become a pathetic excuse for a human... lifeless, empty, no motivation, no dreams nor desires. i sleep hours a day, barely take care of my self, and the only thing i ever do is sit here and play video games to pass the few hours that i am awake. even when people try to help me i do not do anything, which just leaves me to think i might just be a shitty person. nothing seems to help. nothing brings me any happiness. nothing ever seems to help me get my life moving. except for one thing. love. which, i know, sounds a little bit desperate saying that is the only thing that makes me happy... but it is true. the only thing that ever gives me any motivation is having a romantic interest since i no longer desire to do things for my self. being able to hold some one is the only thing helps me relax.. otherwise i am intensely unhappy and always running on stress. i just.. wish i could hold some one is hand. i am not sure what else to say, just kind of wanted to rant a little since i have no one else to bother. this is my first post here, so hello all.	not depression
day what is the point of sti will being alive. a letter to my dad. you told me to be honest with you, and i tried to be, but all that did was make you thisappointed and upset that i was not turning out the way you wanted. when i was honest about my flaws, instead of supporting me, all you did was feel thisappointed and dug the knife in deeper, every ti ame. you get angry when i close myself off, and you are upset when i open up. i can not help feeling afraid, i am not as perfect and as achieving as you are. believe me, i wish i was, and i can already tell that despite all the effort i put in to have an honest thiscussion with you some days ago when you were upset and angry, you did not hear a single thing i said. and you obviously do not remember any of it. your mind somehow can not comprehend anything about me, any of my flaws, the way my mind works, or literally anything about how people work except from your own perspective. how dare you tell me that your life has been awful and that you have suffered. i know you have, and i sympathized once upon a ti ame, but quite frankly i have never received emotional support from you. and despite the craving in my heart for acceptance from his father i know i never wi will. i wanted to do this for you today because i wanted to show i care, but it turns out that it did not matter. you were going to be upset and unhappy anyway, no matter what i did. yes, i was thinking of trying to go driving today, and to practice and everything, but i guess it never mattered. well, if i lucked out and did well, maybe it wouldn t turn out so bad. i am almost . i am going to try and ki will myself on my birthday. for real this ti ame, i wi will have a last day with everything i wanted to do, and then i wi will ditch my phone somewhere north and go as far as i can go without anyone else finding me. i think that is fine. it is just hard to rationalize because i am sti will making plans with people for next week. hard to have to explain to them, and i guess to you, how much i wi will miss being alive. i want to blame you for this, and there is a part of me that wants to hurt you in retribution for all the pain you have caused me that does, but i know it is pointless, both because you wouldn t understand what i meant, and even if you did you d never be able to comprehend what you have actually done to me. i should know, i have tried explaining to you. i guess common sense really does not apply to everyone, huh. i do not really want anything sweet for my birthday. if i had to pick a present, it would probably be something like, being happy. or not wanting to cry so often. just something small, for me. there is so much i really wanted to have said, but i guess that is fine. i do not even know if i hate you, because i do not think that is true. maybe i do, but i feel guilty about it, because it really is not entirely your fault. it is a frustration that i was born without parents that understood me, and a world that had no place for me, that i was forced to carve my own path through, and yet it burdened me with things that took away my ability to do so. it feels unfair, but i know you do not care, you never did about the suffering that you saw was beneath your own experiences. i know you never truly understood my struggle with fighting for my own existence, because you flew through it without taking a scratch yourself, and you should be proud of that achievement. if i offer some advice however, maybe do not look down on those who are not having as much luck as you did in getting through your trials. i do not know, my suicide might be a wake up call for you, but i highly doubt it. you re i ammune to anything that wi will change your mind, except stuff that proves you re right. if anything, this wi will just confirm all your worst theories about me. maybe this way you ll feel freed enough to go and marry someone else and finally live the remainder of your life happy and unrestrained by what you perceive to be the failures of your life. i do not know how i am going to do it yet. but that is alright. i sti will look back on those ti ames i stood by the tracks. it is almost years since i decided that i would try to fix myself. i do not know how far along i have even come, and it feels like i have done nothing good in the ti ame since. i held out for almost years. that is more than i deserved or expected i guess. i do not know what i should do anymore. there is plenty of things i can decide to work on but, i just do not think there is any point someti ames. years. wow. i feel like that is been long enough, i suppose.	not depression

have you ever seen your friends smile and thought yeah they are better off without me ? i wi will start by saying this under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly. it is been a while since that happened. the bell rang and the break began. so i went to find them and when i did they were laughing so hard i was in my very lows that day , i felt so nice for them and at the same ti ame i thought i can not offer them that . before we went back to the classes, i let them walk infront of me because i did not feel like being in the mood and just by looking at them i kept thinking how great they are together. now today i saw some insta stories of them staying at the house of the one i am closest to and it kinda hit me again. i hope i am not just jealous. it is just that at points i feel like i annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that. i always tell jokes and laugh and of the ti ame they would not even notice the state of me because of how well i hide it. i love them, yet i am sure they deserve someone who is not like me. especially the one i am or used to yes i am insecure be closest to. she deserves the world and she is always been there for me but i can not keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom i love so much. i just feel like they clicked so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend. anyway thanks for reading... what about you?	not depression

am i at fault for falling to her? prepare for a long wall of text. i made this in one setting and did not review it so i apologize if my thoughts are scattered but i tried my best. please ask questions if there is something you want cleared. also, i suggest you read my other post over at r molested it is quite short and is related to this. t is been a while since i talked to people on a personal level. last ti ame i did was a long ti ame ago with my parents. i told them about how two close family members have been molesting me. and they kept doing it and teasing me about it. this was at the age of ti will . day in and day out, someti ames more than once a day. i did not know any better and, the obligatory, i kind of enjoyed the attention and the privileges i had. my parents do not know that i have told the story to the both of them because i talked to each of them separately. my rapists knew that my parents are aware of the whole ordeal. i told my parents about it a while after it started when i was sti will . it is really difficult for me to point out every aspect the trauma has influenced my life but i think its safe to assume that it scarred me for life. i hated everything and everyone and the moment i realized that i can leave home, i did. i dropped out of college months in and moved to another city pursuing a new life. desperately trying to thisassociate myself from my past and trying to find something that is meaningful to hold onto. i have i amproved but i have never fully recovered. it was a matter of ti ame ti will i started to go back to my old habits. some things are never meant to change, i guess. i tried to keep myself busy and started going to university to pursue a degree in finance as part ti ame student. you know one more thing to keep me busy but it barely changed anything. i am sti will able to keep myself in check tho. i gave life another go. i went to see a psychologist. i could not say much and left i ammediately. i barely even started because i felt something was off and i excused myself out of there. the psychologist tried her best to keep me but i have already made my mind and she was kind enough to fully refund the appointment bi will. she suggested i see a psychiatrist that can prescribe me medication that wi will help me loosen up a bit. i was not up for it at the beginning but i eventually did. i was diagnosed with adhd, mdd, and severe anxiety thisorder ptsd ocd . i already knew that my mentality is fucked so i could not care less, i just wanted to make sure that i have given life everything before doing something stupid. i sti will have nightmares about it too. i did not get into too many details with the psychiatrist but i have said enough i think. and here comes the crazy part. there is this girl i met online. we never talked in person but she seemed like a nice person. i consider myself an emotionally numb person. the trauma has taken its toll on me, i guess. i have never had intrest in anything. lots of close people died, friendships ended and it never effected me. anyways, i once saw her complaining online about something so i messaged her wondering what is wrong and if there is something i can do to help. i opened up a little to give her assurance that i have good intentions. i said something along the lines of that she should not wallow in her feelings like i did. nothing comes out of it tho but then she tells me that apparently she is a psychology graduate. we go back and forth about random things. i think her niceness did not allow her to let me go with my issues unresolved and i started to catch feelings so i tried my best to stop it right then and there but i kept wanting more. she barely said other than nice things and words of encouragement and assurance but i guess that is what all i ever wanted. it happened to be the weekend so i decided to relax at home and take a break from the internet for a day. also, for whatever reason i thought this was some medication side effect so i decided to stop using them for over a week. i wanted to know if whatever i am feeling is genuine and real. it was and i could not get her out of my mind. i would write her a couple of hundred of words and eagerly await her response, like a drug addict awaiting to get his fix. after a couple of days i tried desperately to thistance myself from her. i could not. so i started dropping hints that she was moving something in me i never experienced before. i thought i was incapable of feeling anything. i have never cried, felt bad about someone or something or wanted something in my life before this. i have done so many messed up things and witnessed a lot more but it never fazed or changed a thing in me. anyways, i am trying to set the boundaries between her and i. i told her that i can get easily attached. that there has to be a high level of inti amacy for me to leave myself vulnerable and that i have been betrayed by of the dearest people to my heart in the past which caused a lot of trust issues. therefore, i try to establish boundaries between others and i to maintain good standings and that i am tired of losing people. i am not sure if i was already screwed or she said something that left me wanting to say more but i did nonetheless. i told her everything but the fact that i was molested for years. i do not want her to pity me. i told her why i have said what i said and that she means a lot to me. plus the fact that i could not take her out of my mind for the last two weeks. i told her that i have never fallen for anyone or anything, i have never been excited to hear from someone, and not in my wildest dreams i could have foreseen this happening. i told her that i decided to stop using the medication because it never helped. she was somewhat upset that i did and holy shit am i a sucker for her. i listened to her and went to see my psychiatrist the following day. i told hi am about stopping the medication. also, she wanted me to tell hi am about what happened between us. i could not do it directly. i told hi am that i usually visit my family because that is what normal people do but it was never something i think about. i told hi am that i started feeling emotional and that i miss my family. he asked what do i think, whether i like feeling this way or not and if seeing them would make me feel happy. i agreed to all and said that i liked how it felt, that i think it is a good feeling and that the only thing on my mind right now is seeing them. when i said family i was referring to her. we concluded this topic by hi am telling me to pursue whatever makes me happy and how to handle future challenges. we also had a chat about adhd and its effects on my uni job performance but that is not relevant to the topic. again, i have come come out clean to her after seeing my doctor. i told her i love her and that i sti will stand by what i said. that i have never wanted anything more in my life and i am the happiest i could have been and that she has been the best thing to happen to me. i appreciate honest people so i thought i should be honest and tell things exactly how they are. i do not think she feels the same way towards me nor does it seem like she is interested, really. i do not blame her whatsoever. i wouldn t want to associate with myself if i had a say in it. i mean i kept changing identities multiple ti ames just because of how much i despise myself so who am i to judge. i am just kind of thisappointed that she dragged me all this way when she knew what she would inflect upon me. i told her that what she was doing wi will break me down eventually, which it did. i do not know why i am saying any of this, really. i guess i want to leave a legacy for just in case. i hate everything and despise myself the most and i want a way out of this misery. i want to end it for good. its been a long ti ame coming and i think that this is it. it can never get any better than this which sti will did not work. i would not give up easily though. i wi will try my best to keep my sanity for as long as possible. i do not know myself as a quitter and wi will never give something up

i really need some advice ok i do not really know how to start this. i have been feeling low for around years now. it is not really there all the ti ame, it mostly comes in bursts of weeks and then just kinda goes away. but since january this year, everything has just felt like too much. during this ti ame, here are a couple of the things i feel numbness guilt lack of interest in things i love i feel alone, yet can not bring myself to be around people. i feel just as alone in a crowd as i do on my own. no one wants to hear what i want to say i feel constantly judged i can not turn my brain off i do not deserve compli aments, and any compli aments i am given are because they feel sorry for me i can not concentrate i feel forgettable nothing i do is good enough i even convince myself that i do not really feel this way and i am doing it for attention there are many reasons why i have never told anyone about it. first, i do not want people to feel sorry for me or treat me any differently. also, i have always found it really hard to ask for help as i feel like i should always have everything under control. i feel as if no one wi will take me seriously and say that i am overreacting. finally, i consider myself to be someone who fixes everyone else is problems, so someone helping me wouldn t feel right. i do not know why i feel like this, but i know there are some things that are really making it worse. first of all, i am hiding loads of secrets from people my own and others . secondly, i am into my second year of exams and had very thisappointing preli am results. i have tried to tell people about it. i drop little hints all over the place hoping that someone wi will latch on, but no one notices. whenever people ask me how i am i am screaming in my head that i feel really bad, but i say that i am fine. i have even tried writing a note but i chickened out of putting it down because i did not want to make my family sad. i feel like at this rate, my family wi will never know how i truly feel. and i feel like i would benefit from getting help now as i feel that if i fail any of my exams, i am going to totally lose it. what is your advice about admitting it to family? how do i do it when i constantly make myself feel like i am overreacting? how do i build up the courage? please, any advice would be much appreciated. thanks in advance.	not depression

probably one of the most embarrassing moments of my life happened today and now i want to die went to see an urologist today for mild testicle pain that had lasted for a month. after investigating, the urologist asked when was the last ti ame i had sex as he was suspecting it was chlamydia. i, a year old, answered that it was not possible that i could have chlamydia. the doctor kept pushing and asking when i last had sex and i tried to not say it but eventually i had to. it is kinda wrecking when you have got no self esteem as it is and after getting your balls groped by a year old man, you have to openly confess that you re a virgin, to which the doctor goes oh... oh, well then , and you have to pay bucks for it and the reason my balls hurt was not even figured out. like come on. has everyone already had sex at age ? i thought i was not like the only ti ame but the doctor was surprised as hell. now on top of being a virgin, i am extremely insecure about it. what a great day.	not depression
is it normal to worry when i do not get a message back from my friend with depression? i sent her a dumb little meme, she saw it and messaged me back instantly. she told me how long she slept in could not get out of bed. i messaged her back upon getting it and then the convo ended. she did not reply back as soon. i thought i might have sent said something back to her but i wonder if something is wrong? what i told her after getting her reply was that i did say that she told me her troubles and it is understandable to be flustered with her personal problems as well as this pandemic. i know she recently had a new therapist and i am tempted to call her since i do not think i have seen something like this before, usually she just takes hours to reply.	not depression

i slept four hours and it just keeps getting worse. i took a week and a half off of school, because i needed a bit of reflection. i did some stuff that gets me through life a bit easier in the long run, but destroys me temporarily, until i am back around people. and then i got news on friday that school is closed for at least two weeks. i can not deal with this shit. i am stuck completely alone in a house, and i can not even scream, because my father is here. i can not even just go watch a show or something, because the crippling loneliness would not let me think. i have always been alone, so i generally know how to manage it, but this is the worst it is been in years. i need to go be around people before i go crazy, but i do not know how to in the first place, and everyone is gone because of the warnings, anyway.	not depression

confirming the fact that i am not good enough so i sing a lot. i love singing and singing in general. i went to a psychiatrist on thursday to get a mental health assessment severe anxiety and depression thisorders surprise surprise and when the psychiatrist asked my dad what my good qualities were he said the only thing he could think of was that i had a good voice. thanks dad for thinking i have no other good quality. for me my voice is the only thing i have. i do not know if it is good or not but i have been told it is. i try to be the best at singing because it is the only thing i can do. so anyways on friday i auditioned for a singing talent show sort of thing at my school and i was really hoping that i got in. but i did not. when i saw that i did not get in i cried so much because it showed me that i really was not good enough. i know i am being annoying and a drama queen about this. but singing is the only thing i have and now every ti ame i sing all i can think about is how i can not even succeed in the one thing i was sure i had a chance in.	not depression

i might be extra weird for doing this but... does anyone else ever get even a little bit of peace from laying in bed and day dreaming or night dreaming if it is bed ti ame about the life or the moments in your life you wish you had? i am going through a separation that is leading to a divorce. it was a very unhappy marriage . so someti ames i wi will lay in bed and dream up what i think being in true love really is and feels like. i wi will think about the happy moments that i wish for myself. i guess it is kind of si amilar to when you play out fake conversations in your head. i guess it is a coping or grieving mechanism, but it does give me some peace. at least a little bit enough to be able to fall asleep some nights.	not depression
things are not going well for me at all. i just wish there was someone there to listen. so...shit has been hitting the fan recently. it is just like one thing after another and it just keeps hitting me down over and over again. and it is starting to hurt and i am not sure how long i can take this anymore. as for stuff that is happened, well i almost had a date. i am years old, i have never been on a date on my life since i was homeschooled and very socially awkward. i have been using dating apps for two years with no luck until i matched with this girl a few weeks ago. we talked and chatted over the phone and things were looking well, we even had a date scheduled. but the day before, she messages me saying that she is not ready for a relationship. i told her i understood, i did not want to be a dick about it. but deep down...i felt pretty hurt. i was almost there, and the rug was pulled under from me. it felt like god is cruel joke. i am not mad at the girl or anything because she is not obligated to date me although i do wonder why she was on a dating app in the first place...? but i wi will say it hurt a bit. we have not spoken since. my job. it fucking sucks. i am a pizza delivery driver and i hate it. customers are rude and the managers keep pressuring me to do everything faster. i am autistic and i am really not meant for this kind of work environment, but my parents charge me rent so i really need a job. they keep making me answer the phones even though they know how much social anxiety it gives me. i showed up late to work the other day and got a warning that next ti ame i wi will be written up and honestly...i do not care anymore. but i have realized i might be doing shitty jobs like this for the rest of my life, all this meaningless toil just so i can survive. it is so pointless. so fucking empty. i had to cancel a film shoot for a movie i have been making. this is the third ti ame i have had to cancel it and i have been working on this one scene for months. why? because of the fucking coronavirus. everything fun is getting shut down. except work. of course i have to go to work. filmmaking is one of the few things that i am passionate about, that makes me feel alive. and of course that has to get shit on too. i feel like i am about to explode any minute. there is just so much pent up grief and frustration and anxiety and depression inside of me. i do not know what to do. i have occasionally been thinking of suicide, or maybe just running away. i do not know how to talk to anyone because they wi will worry about me. i feel so alone.	not depression
i feel like my friend is only my friend out of pity so i have this friend who i guess i am really close with? she knows about my mental health and is always there for me and wants to hang out and asks me how i am doing. we also have the same humor and its always really fun with her. but i sti will can not shake the feeling that its all fake , and that she is only my friend because she knows how bad i am doing and that i dont have alot of friends. she is also kinda out of my league, meaning that she is the type of person who easily makes friends and is a and everybody wants to befriend her, so i just wonder why befriend me, when you can befriend litteraly anyone else? so i kinda always fight inside my head, wether my mental i willnes is just saying that to me, or wether its legit. because i dont want to be some fcking charity case for someone else. so the person can feel like theyve done their good deed of the day.	not depression

having to spend the next month alone terrifies me so much i can barely think i am scared, so this might be a bit rambley. and i know there are worse things that people are going through especially right now but i do not need that pointed out to me. i guess i wi will start with some backstory. i am , irish, female, bartender, writer, sister, daughter, auntie, friend. yesterday, my bar announced that it was closing for the next week and the taoiseach has not officially put us into lockdown yet but we wi will be by tuesday apparently. social gatherings were banned, public places were told to close and we re all obviously being told to stay the fuck indoors. not only am i worried about the fact that a pandemic the likes of which has never been seen in history is encapsulating the entire planet, or for the safety of my loved ones, friends and colleagues or the fact that i now have no job, no savings and no way to pay rent on the first, the thing that i am most afraid of losing is my sanity. i grew up in an extremely difficult household, my parents were verbally, emotionally and physically abusive. my dad was only ever there to hurt us or shout at us and my mother is an alcoholic. my older sister left the second she could and my older brother withdrew to avoid them so i was left to raise my little sister as best i could. i have had depression for as long as i can remember. i was diagnosed after an overdose at and psychiatrists have always told me that it seems i had depression since i was a young girl. i did not even know that was possible. it is eaten every inch of my mind, my body and my life. it affects every single tiny little thing that i do good or bad. i have trust issues, abandonment issues, self hatred, an eating thisorder and a very bleak outlook on life in general. or i should say i did. last year was the worst year of my life by far, it all just seemed to come to a head and i grew so frustrated with it that a miracle happened. i had to do something to change it. okay no, not a miracle. i have been in and out of therapy since i was and i have been on antidepressants on and off the whole ti ame too. four years ago, i found my therapist amy and it changed my life. i have been seeing her at least once a week since and i have been back on meds for the last three or so years too. i have made so much progress and worked so hard and gotten so far that this year, i felt happy and settled enough to come off my medication and even take a break from therapy! and i have been doing great! i am literally a new person, if it comes up in conversation with people that i have met this year, they are shocked at my background and history with mental i willness! it is incredible. do not get me wrong. i have bad days and weeks sti will. the darkness is sti will and wi will always be there. it just so happens that for the first ti ame in my life, there is light too! sorry if this is too much, i just need to vent and i do not think i can even call amy in the midst of this. so we come to yesterday. i usually live in the city with a couple that i am not close with at all but they are not bad people, we just do not vibe. i was planning on staying with my parents this weekend anyway so i came after work on friday. i had a good day yesterday, playing with my nephew and catching up with my family we have a very strained relationship now and it is in no way healthy but to me, it is better than nothing and my two year old nephew is reason enough to try to build a relationship with them and he is the main reason i visit every few weeks. i am sorry, i wi will get to the point. my family say i should stay here while this all tides over but being in this house where my heartbreaking childhood happened is always difficult for more than a couple days. with our strained relationship, i spend a lot of ti ame here alone to avoid them and when we are together, it is often at odds. i can sti will exercise here, i wi will probably be able to see friends and it wi will be easier to see the guy i am seeing if we can at all. my other option is to go back to my apartment in the city where i wi will be stuck with my housemates, which i also find very socially awkward and i would probably spend the whole ti ame in my room or on the balcony, alone. i do not know if i wi will be allowed out of the apartment to exercise if lockdown comes and there is no space at all to exercise inside. it wi will be very unlikely to see friends there too. everyone is delighted with two four weeks to sit at home getting fat and watching tv but me? it is my worst nightmare. i usually work hours a week, go to the gym four days a week and meet friends every single day. i stay out of the house as much as i possibly can because even though i enjoy spending hours every day on my own smoking and watching youtube or writing, i can not spend long periods of ti ame at home or alone. i am afraid i wi will be a shell of a human being either way at the end of the month and it hurts so much to know i wi will have to backtrack on a lot of the work i have done already. i hate this, i hate all of it and i am sorry to be complaining about something that seems insignifican not compared to everything that is happening but my mind is the only thing i have ever had and my happiness is something i worked very long and hard for and i si amply can not lose it.	not depression
i hate the realization of knowing that you are really alone i know many people feel lonely, left behind or forgotten and from ti ame to ti ame i think so too. i wi will feel very lonely then, think about all the years i was left completely alone to deal with all my inner demons and how i was the one who had told me to hold on for the people i love. but someti ames, like right now, the real realization of how alone i really am, hits me and it is so painful. i have a hard ti ame crying but those are the moments where i feel the tears. i do not know how to describe it. this feeling of realizing that you are completely left alone and always have been. that no one knows how you have been feeling for all this years and it breaks my heart so much. i do not know what i want or expect from other people because everyti ame someone gets close to me, i push them away. i am just tired of feeling so much pain and sadness. wi will this ever end? like really, wi will this ever have an end? i do not want sadness to be my way of living anymore. it is so tiring and my heart is just breaking over and over and over. i do not know if anyone really understands how desperate i am right now, to find anything to hold onto. i do not know what to do anymore.	not depression

last few days have been strange so, the first thing that was kind of a positive, was seeing this girl i like from work, who i spent the morning with on valentines day we went for lunch shopping in the store we work at with her now ex, ex boyfriend after her shift finished. it was certainly overwhelming seeing them together and a punch in the gut. but i realised i need to i amprove myself. i am not happy with myself, i am not the best version of myself and so i need to work on i amproving myself. maybe people wi will be interested in me then. it gave me the motivation to go back to the gym. ive been days in a row and am going to continue. i went almost everyday for years straight when i was , and was quite built. depression ruined that. so i decided days ago i want to do a steroid cycle. it may seem like an extreme idea, and my lifestyle recently is not one of someoe who should be doing roids. but i think the only way i wi will stay dedicated and eat well and train hard is if i have them ready as an option. ie i buy what i need and prepare the cycle. but i workout and diet for a month straight without fail, knowing the steroids are on the table. then i do a week cycle eating clean and training well and sleeping more. i know people on here wi will tell me not to but it has to happen. you can give me pros and cons if you like, but dont say dont do that . so another thing that happened was i recehed out to school friend who i havent heard from since school years ago. it was his bday the other day so i said hb on fb and sent hi am a message yesterday asking how his bday was. we started chatting, he told me hes had depression because one of his best mates who he was living with at uni hung hi amself. sounds like it messed hi am up a lot, understandably. we used to have good ti ames, and i considered hi am one of my best friends. i wish we hadnt lost touch. and we have to make up for lost ti ame. it made my week for sure hearing from hi am again besides hearing what hes been through. we re arranging to meet up someti ame soon and smoke some bud and have a laugh which i look forward to a lot. i am also wanting to start boxing but my social anxiety stopped me. i can not do things like that myself, meeting new people and stuff. but i chose my first ring walk song kalinka or just the instrumental coz the lyrics are shite lbh. now i just need to start going. my heart is there i love boxing and fighting. but my mind says nah i can go to some club and meet a load of new people all at once and where potentially all of them can beat my ass. like i am sure theyll be other beginners but that doesnt stop the anxiety. someone give me some encouraging words.	not depression

i f am a crying babbling mess. life does not seem to be getting any better. this ti ame last year my f life was so different. although i was lbs heavier than i am now amp really anxious about my job, i was doing well there in my career, made good money, was headed on vacation to the beach, in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who i thought liked me. fast forward to now i was fired from that job, then i got another job which i was laid off from in december because they got rid of my whole department sti will looking for work , sti will have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and was not shy about it and had no ulterior motives, and i am beyond sad and cry every day. i am crying writing this. i want to feel better, to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that i go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by, but i can not. it frustrates me and i feel so dumb. dating it has been so awful for me. i know that having a partner would not bring me the happiness i need on my own, i need to focus on myself, my ti ame wi will come, but i hate hate hate hearing that shit. i have been focusing on myself for the last . years, and i think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with. and i also hate when someone says but you re so pretty smart and kind and alluring, you ll find someone! you do not know that!!!!!! i have been noticeably different towards my friends. i decided to open up to one of them and now that i have, i really wish i had just gone with the i am fine response. she is trying to help and i know that i am difficult to even have a conversation with right now. she said if i needed thistance then she would give it, but it feels selfish to do that, so i continue to say it is fine to continue talking. but it hurts to hear about hers or the other people in my life increase in pay at her job, her new guy she is seeing, how her life is going so well, when mine is utter and complete shit. and all i can do is compare and it leads to more crying. she says she wants to help me get out of the funk i am in and that i have every right to feel how i feel but i need to be more positive. i love her and thank her for want to help, but i hate hearing that. which then leads me back to thinking maybe i should just thistance myself. we have argued a bit lately. and i know it is because of me. i have become too attached we talk throughout the day, every day amp i get more anxious when i do not hear from her. i tried being vulnerable this afternoon and i sti will have not heard from her. but i am resisting sending another text. i absolutely hate how much things like this i s affect my happiness. i wish i was not such a shit person and friend. people always suggest gym and eating better as ways to cope. well the thing is is that i already go to the gym ti ames a week someti ames daily . there around min to hours. during that ti ame is the only ti ame i am confident, happy, and determined in myself. i feel strong, capable, and on top of the world. but as soon as i leave, it is back to shit. but if i did not have the gym, i do not know how even darker and more depressed i would feel. also i live at home with my parents and sister right now i have not eaten more than one small meal a day really in the past days. i have been able to hide it from them. not that i am trying to starve myself, but when i get really sad nowadays it i think i thisappoint my friend or my family, i do not eat. due to not working and not really having money, i do not go anywhere. which leads to mini amal social interaction. i did not realize that it would affect me so much. but it really has. on the off chance i talk to someone at the gym, that makes my week because that is usually the only interaction i get. i go to my favorite local bar every so often and it helps just to be somewhere different. but i feel guilty spending a little money on two drinks and to socialize. i do the the things that they say most people who are depressed usually do not do i clean, make meals for myself, shower daily, go to the gym. so then i think to myself, maybe i am not depressed? maybe i am making this up and it is not legiti amate. and job i have applied, but honestly i have been hesitant to apply to a lot of jobs because i just do not feel smart enough or capable enough at all. i have colleagues in my field who say i am young, smart and capable. but it does not feel that way given my recent job history. how are you? my honest answer for the last months i am tired i am lonely and i am stupid and i hate myself.	not depression
family is calling me rude. i just do not have the energy. plus slight rant. i have been at my grandparents place for a few weeks. do not plan to be here long, currently finding another place to rent since i have been back, i have had many triggers. while away years , i took meds, went to a counselor and volunteered with ani amals when i knew i was coming down with an episode. some days were worst than others but for the most part, i sort of had it handled. now, i have nothing that i had. most days are bad. there is family that is come from out of town. honestly, i am just not in a social mood. my grandparents told them i was in the room so they knocked. i went out to speak and came back in the room. now, i have a cousin bothering me in the room telling me no ones seen each other in years. you should be out here with everybody, you re being rude. i did not ask anyone to come. had my car been out the shop, i would have left before they even got here so me speaking is me being nice to them at the moment. there is more people coming over and it is bothering me. i feel me being rude is being out there and not speaking. i am not trying to spread my energy. i am really annoyed. my family does not take mental health serious so i am almost always the rude or mad one. i am over it. this is why i dreaded coming back here. i hate that i let myself get to a point so bad in life that i had to come back. i found some truths about my mom is death last year and it hit me to the core. that took a toll on my mental and drive. it is frustrating me more the same people who tried to hide truths because someone they love is was involved are the same people who is making me seem foolish for feeling the way i feel. i have the same feeling i had before i moved away, it is just more intense now. my grandpa makes me feel worthless, i am only . he has kids over and sti will solely dependent on hi am but treats them completely different. treats me like shit because of my attitude told me he wish he had never taken guardianship of me before i moved and recently repeated it since i have been back. told me i deserved it. looks right over his children flaws, one of his loving kids is the reason behind my mom being dead today. he treats them like royalty. i do not get it.	not depression

one of those nights i am m, and this is another of those bad nights. i really do not know what to say, i just needed to express something somewhere. i suppose this is a place where everyone can feel safe enough to just.. lay down your stuff i am sad, i am tired of not beeing able to make the girl i have been years in love with finally takes the step to try a relationship with me. i feel stupid and the life feels cruel and scary, a game you just can not win. i want to cry, and to be strong enough so i do not have to cry. i just wished this night was not one of those nights. sorry for my english, i am not a native speaker	not depression
i am afraid of this covid outbreak. for some context, i am an international college student studying in america. to be clear, i am not actually afraid of the virus itself, but i am afraid of being isolated for too long. a few days ago, i was really hurt by a relationship problem the full story is on my profile if you re interested and i have not had the ti ame to recover from this. truth be told, this is the second ti ame in a few months and i thought i had learned from the first ti ame, but i suppose not. this has affected my mood negatively for the past few days or so. my spring break is extended for another week starting tomorrow, and it seems like the rest of my semester wi will be done online, every college event has been canceled. bars and restaurants where i live are shutting down from today onwards. i think it is fair to say that i would not have much contact with people for quite a long ti ame. it is quite ironic, a few months ago, people in my main friend group envied me for going out with so many other folks. if you told me that this would be happening to me a few months ago, i would have laughed in your face. i guess i am writing this part to contrast my experience and let you guys know how much i have fallen. i have isolated myself here and there over the years, but nothing like this before and i wi will be honest, it frightens me. i think it would be nice to read some of your si amilar experiences if there are any, i always think i can extract useful insight from people who have gone are going through a si amilar experience. i wi will try my best to help any of you if i can if you re going through something resembling this.	not depression
hey so i dont know how to say this exactly. but i moved half way across the world and i feel so alone. so essentially about months or so back i moved from india to usa. i am in a midwest state. i moved cause i got a green card and everyone told me not to give that up. i got my first job fresh outta college and i moved. my parents are back home, all my friends are back, the person i love is also back home. i feel alone most of the ti ame. i spent today evening crying thinking what did i do to end up here and be in this situation. also to add to this, my family back home is really going through financial hardship indian economy is screwed and the middle class upper middle to lower middle took the worst hit . i dont want to tell my parents anything cause they themselves have way too much to deal with. also i think pretty soon they are going to loose the house i spent years of my life in. i dont know what to do. i feel so trapped. all i do is run my body on autopilot and just do the mini amal to exist and do my job. i want to take steps go gain more ski wills and i amprove my situation but all i do is fucking cry and feel like shit. these feelings peaked today. i was mainly suppressing these feelings so that i could function but i could not today. nothing really triggered it. all i did was take a nap and wake up crying. i usually wake up feeling fucked up. someti ames i go to sleep hopin i wouldn t wake up. or wake up back home and this is all an emotional nightmare. i think i surely missed out on some other details but i hope this paints a picture of my situation. any advice on this would be appreciated. thank you for reading! hope everyone gets through whatever they are going through.	not depression

ideas to help our mental health and wellbeing we all know about the benefits of exercise, eating well, finding a medication that helps, mindfulness, therapy etc does anyone have other coping mechanisms that seem to help them in certain situations? i am also interested in hearing ideas you have that could help people, that perhaps you have not yet tried. for example at university i was unable to access a counsellor, so i wanted to start a mental health thiscussion group for people to meet up and to help support each other.	not depression

all of my problems would be solved if i was not ugly and short i have always never been attractive, strong, popular or any relating characteristics. i always have been that nerd kid who never had any real friends, never was someone who other people knew, and never was anyone is best friend. i would see all of my other acquaintances have conversations that are not sided with other people and relationships with people. i would have many different crushes on people that were in my classes and i never was able to get them to talk to me. i feel as if, if i was not ugly, short, or fat, people would respect me and have conversations with me. people wi will try to deny this but it is true, people wi will talk more and respond to texts faster and be more friendly with people that are attractive vs people who are not that attractive. if only i could become attractive maybe i could get a girlfriend. even more, maybe my friends would actually want to make plans with me and maybe they would respond to my text messages. the only thing that gives me small feelings of happiness is playing video games and seeing people upvote my shit on reddit. my life has no meaning, to anyone. my parents and i have a strained relationship. they always yell at me for dumb shit and i for some reason sti will love and hate them. if only i was attractive, i wouldn t be depressed. i lost a genetic lottery and i am paying for it in my sanity. i want to fucking ki will myself but i do not have the guts to do that.	not depression

i have only ever had one female friend in high school, i feel like most females do not like introverts. i am a year old musli am pakistani dude born and raised in america. for as long as i can remember, i have only had one true female friend who would actually care about me, invite me to stuff, etc and that was in high school. i would usually have been quite confident and in my own life but suddenly this year i have got this depressive feeling like everyone is fake, no one cares. i talk to females and they only enjoy small talk, before i can even say anything they friend zone me. i hear all the ti ame about hookup culture, my friend came on to me what are we? , texting buddies, etc. how do you even? am i supposed to be this confident guy and just approach women randomly in the mall and be like hey, i think you re attractive, let us drink! i feel like offing myself and someti ames i just feel like finding an escort because at least i could say that i have gotten laid and in a way that ll boost my confidence and i could learn a thing or two.	not depression
all the virus stuff is low key the most exciting thing that is happened in a long ti ame for how painfully dull all my days seemed, there is suddenly this twist on things quarantine, avoiding others, no leisure, etc. like i am one in those dreams again where you re in a completely different scenario from your current life and things are actually interesting again, y know? at the same ti ame, i do not think i would mind if this fucking plague takes me. of course there is nothing actually good about it. it wi will suck ass. probably more than my previous years. there is literally nothing to be looking forward to. my dog does not look like he is got long left, the only light that would keep me company while i would sob in a corner, and the only thought spinning in my head is just how much i regret wasting the last five miserable years in university when there is the slightest chance i could have had a better ti ame had i taken a different path. probably not, i am sure my issues are deeper than that, but just what if? it is hard to i amagine it being much worse. now the life we re used to could very well be ending and if i die tomorrow the most i can say is that i have peaked at . oh but so much to live for! i know realistically this wi will probably pass and i have got a long life to live, but what for? the only guarantee is loss people, places, anything that brings some happiness. i know it is on me to make the positives happen, that it would not just come magically, but how? how do people find things to counteract all the lows? i mean i have got some hobbies, some friends i hang out with, stuff i do on free ti ame, but none of it seems in any way worth it compared to all the ti ames i am feeling like shit. more often than not i feel like i am just doing it all to detach myself from reality and not because i actually enjoy it. i hoped to take a year off studies and take some ti ame to figure things out but man it looks like this is going to be the year that completely breaks me instead. happy almost birthday to me.	not depression

vent good day. i just thought i would vent here to see if it would even remotely help. i have been dealing with depression for over half a year now. it started when my grandmother is health began to rapidly deteriorate because of cancer. she passed away exactly half a year ago. it broke my heart she was a second mother to me. raised me, was always at my side during the most i amportant events of my life and would never stop being proud of me. a month and a half later, i lost an equally i amportant person my first romantic partner because of sins of a sexual nature. we made a promise to abstain from such themes, but kept failing and i am the one to take most of the blame for it. they have cut all communication save for a few, very minor interactions. i even lost all of my friends, save for a couple of them, in the span of a week. as it stands, i am deeply depressed and do not seem to be making much, if any, progress. i used to try to be as devoted a christian as i could, but i have even let go of my faith. i have an i ammense amount of hate inside of me. hate towards myself for not being able to overcome this sadness, even when i am going to a psychiatrist. for making my parents who are aware of this situation and the few friends i have left worried. for all the mistakes i made and keep making. hate towards the fact that my grandmother had to leave us. i do not even know if i hate the person i broke up with or the fact that they left me in such an apparently easy way in a couple of moments. hell, i know for a fact that they have been better off since the breakup. hate towards sadness itself. nowadays, most of the things i feel are either sadness, anger or guilt. the worst part is, i have convinced myself that i deserve this, that i should not be happy, that i should remain depressed, so on and so forth. my parents keep saying that i wi will have a bright future, or that i wi will grow up to be a good person. it is the same thing my grandmother and ex used to say. i feel as though it makes things worse. i try to be sympathetic and understanding towards everyone else, but i can not do so the same effect as before given all of my problems. i also try to pull myself together for the sake of my parents and younger brother, but i never succeed. i wish they would let me die. the combination of being tossed aside, losing my friends and more has made me feel worthless. i am an incredibly miserable conglomerate of depression, hate and guilt and i can not see things getting any better. i sincerely believe myself to be a lost cause, and that the best, most straightforward solution to this whole predicament is to end it all. i could shoot myself, overdose on any pi wills i find, jump in the middle of the road... the list goes on. i am i ampossibly tired all the ti ame. i have lost interest in stuff i used to like. i do not even feel like i am living. come to think of it, i can not find a point or reason behind writing this. it did not even make me feel any better. sorry if this made you worried. i wish you the best.	not depression

my little journal so at the end of last year at a party, i was a little drunk and feeling incredibly depressed. i opened my phone and went into my notes app. i typed in the date and ti ame followed by some awful words about myself, i dont know why i did it or why i thought i had to write down what i was feeling. perhaps i wrote what i wrote because i couldnt and sti will can not tell anyone how i am feeling. to date i have seven additional notes, all locked so nobody but me can view them and all written when i feel the worst. these notes range from months to someti ames just hours apart i have begun starting each note with a i hate myself then detailing exactly why i hate myself and anything else self deprecating that i am thinking about in the moment. i have considered suicide seriously at this point about a handful of ti ames but i know i wi will not attempt it because i am too much of a coward. what is so surreal about my situation is that i think i have a unique outlook on it, i know what i should do to fix my issues but i just can not get myself to cooperate. when i am out with friends i am so good at masking my feelings that nobody knows, i just sit there participating as if nothing is wrong but in my head i am dragging myself through the mud. if someone asks me how i am doing i respond with a bright smile and a yeah i am doing great and yourself but on the inside i am just crying. at the end of this, i question why i have decided to waste someone is ti ame reading my pointless post. i hope you all find the true happiness in your lives, this is something i wish noone had to experience. i hate myself more and more each day.	not depression
just a messy rant it is been years since i have been depressed, but so much has been going on and it just set it off. it is been months and it is the worst i have ever experienced. my head feels so clouded, has it been weeks or months? i feel like the thoughts in my head are rocks, i am being weighed down and i can not keep myself above the water. it is never been easy for me to open up and share but the feeling that my heart is being pulled apart and ripped is physically painful and excruciating, maybe it is just a heart attack. i thought i had good friends but when i reached out to them for help the only thing i got was a notice that they saw my message with no response at all. it is funny how much you can bend over backwards for the people you love for them to leave you like that. i think i love people more than they wi will ever love me back. maybe i just have shit taste in friends. maybe it is selfish of me to expect them to help when they have their own lives idk. the only thing i know is how terrible i feel and how bad i want it to stop.	not depression

what am i doing? quick note, i made this throwaway to write this, that is why i do not have any karma. there are also many mentions of self harm in here. i do not know what i am doing anymore. i am f and i have been happy my whole life. my parents are great people, i love my brother with all my heart, i have amazing friends who support me every day. yet somehow, for some reason completely beyond me, i feel so alone. yes, i have my friends outside of my school, but i look around and see all these people at school who seem to know and want to talk to everyone but me. i go to school for hours every day and it is hours of hell. out of days a week. i want people to talk to me. i wish people would just notice me for once. every morning i have no motivation to wake up and get through the day. it is made me stop doing my schoolwork among other things. a few weeks ago, i thought about cutting myself. i do not know why, but it seemed like such a good idea at the ti ame. i just thought it would fix everything. so i tried. i took a pair of scissors to my wrist. they weren t sharp enough. so the feeling went away. i told my friend. she did not know how to react. i told my mom. she freaked out and told my dad. he freaked out and told my brother. they all freaked out and told my therapist. therapy has been helping, but i sti will get so many urges to cut. it started off as a suggestion my brain was making, but now it feels like i have to. i have to cut my pain away. it feels like the only way to stop the emotional pain i am feeling is to cut it out. my brain keeps telling me i have to, i have to cut, i have to cut my pain away. i have some friends on speed dial who are always happy to help when i freak out like that, but the urges get stronger every ti ame. the last ti ame i tried was with an earring, and for some reason my brain was telling me it was a terrible idea to call my friend, that i would just be a burden to them. thankfully i resisted the urge. it is gotten to the point where every ti ame i touch anything remotely sharp, i can only think about cutting. i do not have anything sharp in my room. my parents insist on cutting my food for me. someone, anyone, please tell me. what the hell am i doing and how do i stop? i so badly want to, but i just can not. this temptation scares me, yet it seems like it is my only option. i am so terrified it is going to get so bad that i wi will start cutting for real, and then one day i wi will cut my entire life away.	not depression

why do not i care? i just want to know why its i ampossible for me to feel anything about others. its just that i can not give two fucks about them. i like to be the person that they rant to to feel better but overall i see their problems as i willogical and easily fixable but my answers come off as harsh so i just do not say it. it is not like i am not human and do not have emotions. i have happiness, sadness, anger and frustration. the only thing i feel bad about is not feeling bad. one ti ame a friend of mine relayed information about her life and it was some sad shit. i am talking about long story about her friends and family being ki willed and i just could not care about it. i have had family of my own die and when i went to wakes and funerals it felt like they were strangers to me even though i have known them and bonded with them my whole life to really figure out what is going on i often think of my brothers and mother dying to see it any emotion wi will come from it and... nothing. the only thing that ever makes me feel some type of way is when there is a lack of logic when approaching a situation or when someone is actions affect me negatively. anything else brings no form of emotion to me what made me come to this sub to ask is this. during this coronavirus shitshow. my aunt learned my college in new york is closed due to the outbreak. it was somewhat near my area so her response was she drove from her state which has cases to my college also cases picked up me and my cousins, took me home to long island where we also have cases where my mom and brothers dad are heavy smokers, and drove my cousins back home to dc heavy lack of brain cells . while here in only one day i gave my mother roughly dollars and my brother to get to work. i do not work. that was money i saved during college that i should have lied about having. now i am back home for the month and thinking about just taking the train back to my college because i was safer there than home that is pretty much all that i care about. i can not mister up any reason to care about anything else. maybe i was just oversti amulated as a kid through experiences that new shit does not phase me unless it hurts me... i do not know i hope someone here reads this and can help me understand	not depression
yep! i am tired and i am not okay. that feels so good just letting it out. i do not want to scare anyone that loves me. this too shall pass. for now i am just wanting to sleep it out.	not depression
my friends gone forever, and now i am all alone . i wi will never have that again, cause it was not me, it was her. i destroy, and shatter and sicken, i scare people away from me. and she, she, was just so caring and unconditionally compassionate as to be a friend to someone as broken as me. and i told her, i told her i did not understand her because such kindness, and lack of judgement, it was fundamentally not human. so now i am alone. forever more. and it hurts, in her as much as it did when i was , it took me years to get used to it the first ti ame round. i was doing better. and then life throws me this as penance, as if i was not suffering enough. most people do not get it, but friendship hurts, caring hurts, feeling hurts. not the bad stuff that is fine, the good stuff, because it reminds you of all the bad, reminds you how alone you are, reminds you what you sti will have to lose, reminds you you re sti will alive.	not depression
there is this girl... and i can not get over her... she is not just any girl not to me at least. she means aloof. she is a lot. see after two years of forsure a weird ass relationship i fell in love with erin. i honestly did not even intend on that to happen. it took two years for me to actually even get that idea. we did not have the closest relationship but it was close enough for me to become attached at one point. not even that but she is truly admirable and someone to look up to as a beautiful human being. of course she is quite gorgeous but that is besides the point. i really hate myself for not being good enough. obviously if i was good enough things would be different but i just was not enough in someway or another... possibly and quite certainly more. idk what to do with myself. i have not been able to actually. it is been over two years. i am in pain i have been in pain i am making little to no actual progress.... i do not think i ever wi will. this event has ruined my life. it is hurt me enough to hinder me in every way. it is not her fault at all. i am the reason i am not good enough for her wherever the reason s it is all my fault. fuck me... i hate being a live	not depression
overwhelmed and need advice it is my birthday. i am feeling really down. i am not doing anything at all. i got out of a year relationship recently, someone i spent every second with and had planned to marry. i loved hi am and we were best friends. he would become abusive, it was not a lot but it was enough for me to know it would continue. it was really hard to leave and we both cried a lot but now he is dating a new girl. apparently i am very sensitive and an idiot because this hurts me to see in spite of everything. my friends in the area moved away long ago. so i am all alone. i had to pay off a massive medical bi will, and now have no money for rent that is due tomorrow. on top of it, i have been putting off dental work for months because they quoted me dollars with insurance and i keep thinking there wi will be a ti ame when i have that kind of extra money. i used to have a great salary. i lost my job and now everything is piling up. i want to start a business and i know i would be successful but i can not get a loan because i am sti will building my credit. there is so much stress. i am going to lose the place i have rented and made into a home the past years. now my work just sent us an email that we would not be going in for at least two weeks because of the coronavirus. i know they have the funds to pay us, but they are saying this is our unpaid vacation where we can recuperate. i am so happy for workers that are having their wages covered during this ti ame, but i wish more businesses would do this. on the other hand i get that it makes sense that if they are not earning money, they can not pay it. i honestly have no where to go and do not know what to do. if i could get a loan of some kind, i would pay it back x in the future. i have an amazing business plan and if i could breathe for a second i could make it great. unfortunately, i can not have a family member sign for me. my father is abusive and if i mention anything to do with money he would tell me i am a loser or ruining his life, etc. my mother has never had a paid job and is constantly abused my hi am as he is the money earner. my dream has always been to get her away and get myself away from hi am. but it is looking like i might have to go back and stay with them. any advice would be appreciated. 	not depression
i feel like a caged ani amal with the whole covid pandemic and what not, i feel even and even more trapped. college and my apartment used to be an escape from the sort of monotonous life i led before then and actually gave my life structure, independence, or some purpose, as pathetic as that sounds. but, with all of this, i am now stuck at home with my parents who i recently had a falling out with so its just, uncomfortable and i dread it here. and i recently got an email from my college that they wi will be going to online classes for the rest of the semester. wonderful, i get to stay home even longer and feel the scraps of motivation and life i had before continue to slip away even further. my identity and purpose is just slipping away like a second skin. i already had a shaky sense of self to begin with thanks to my thissociation issues but this is just, adding insult to injury. i feel like i am going to go to bed one day and i am going to wake up to realize nothing was real to begin with, that everything was fake. doesnt help that i already feel unreal pretty much all of the days now. there is nothing to do. well, there is, but nothing i care about anymore. i used to like writing and drawing and creating but now its just empty empty and pointless. classic depression am i right? sure, the meds have been working but my environment sti will has i ampact and this is just making things worse. feeling trapped and held up like i am some fish won at a carnival game by a kid whos going to let me die in a few days due to shitty care. my friends. can i even call them that anymore? they seem like strangers and feel like them too. i try to talk to them and i feel like they dont really care or are bothering to spend as much ti ame as i put into them to even comfort me. its always about them really. like i want to thisappear. guess my lifeti ame warranty is wearing out. guess the only thing left to do is completely thisappear, something like that. its not active suicidal ideation but fizzling and fading away might as well be the best option here to save myself from wasting more ti ame on things i dont care about. a sort of mercy ki will. they take take and take and never give back until they realize its too late and should have given more so they could keep taking from me down the line.	not depression
i hate life m. someti ames it feels like there is just so much wrong with me that no matter what i can never be okay that no matter what i wi will never be happy. it is so hard when all you desperately want is someone literally anyone just notice that you are not okay and help because iam so sick of being alone. i tried to start changing things in my life so i can not atleast be a little bit happier but at the end it just made everything worse. i am so sick of living i have started hating everyone and everything in my life whether they did something or not. i want to die and it but i am so scared and terrified. just needed a rant	not depression

i do not know who i am. am i too far gone? am i fucked up in the head or something? i have no clue who i am or what i am doing with my life. i do not truly know myself. i do not know what i like or thislike. i do not know what my values are. i have no opinions of my own. i have no passions. i have no ski wills. i have no talents. i do not know anything about myself. i do not even know what my dreams or goals are for my future. i do not truly know what i want for myself. i have vague ideas, but i am not sure if they are even my own or taken from someone else. i do not know what i really want from life. it is almost like i am not even a human. i am not even my own person. i just function on habits only anymore. i realize when i do something out of habit though. and i beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. is there something wrong with my brain? it is like i am a robot. all i can truly say i know about myself is that i exist and that is it. i do not know i am just kind of terrified from the realization that i am so fucking lost. wi will i ever know who i am? or am i too far gone in the sense that i polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear anxiety and never developed a sense of self? i can fake being someone but who am i really? this is so fucking scary and i need help	not depression

in tears right now.. sorry for the very long post i just needed to vent... this might sound pathetic but i literally have no friends family anybody i know that lives in the area that i am currently living in. my problem starts where the it says my issue . but honestly to get the full picture of how tragic my life feels right now read the background. some background... i am in my late twenties and grew up i a military family so i have never lived long in on location. at the age of i left for the military myself but that is when my life changed for the worse. i was abused by my sqaud members almost daily. the abuse started as general new guy hazing stuff like making my run around looking for i amaginary things or orders etc. but things started to ramp up quickly being that i was the smallest and the youngest. it started with very hurtful verbal abuse calling me racist names, calling me worthless a retard for asking questions etc from people my own rank all the way up to the my warrant officer. soon verbal turn physical and yes sexual. i was not raped but i wi will not relive those memories for this post neither. things carried on like that for what seemed like an eternity, i pretty much was forced out only years into my dream of a long military career after failed suicide attempts and an alcohol incident. when i first came back i had a horrible ti ame readjusting back to my former life. i was literally pounds over weight and the weight that i was when i entered boot camp at . i was back living with my parents which felt embarrassing and and overki will already to my already low sense of worth. i tried so reach out to everyone that i could to try to hang out with or talk but thi is always felt awkward or in some cases i would be thirstier than a dying guy backing in the desert for months and i ammediately ruin the conversation and any chance of friendship. i was so desperate for a normal sense of a relationship i fell quickly into a very toxic relationship i was a major contributor to the toxicity along with her some of her actions years later she ended up leaving me and i do not blame her one bit. i was extremely clingy and jealous. since i was not treating any of my symptoms of depression and anxiety i would have days where i would literally sleep all day even at her place.... which was another thing.... when i first came back i had a horrible habit of never sleeping at night because again i was not treating my ptsd or sleeping for days like a bear in hibernation. so when i was dating her i was always at her place. on my fridays i would pack some things in a backpack and no joke as if i was a kid going to sleep over his friend is house on the weekends. i would go to her place and sleep over then go back to my parents place as i worked and continue the cycle. i would have mental breakdowns at home too. i would have night terrors and periods where i would cut burn myself leaving a couple of horrible scars on my chest shoulder and forehead. anyways things got a little better after i went on an absolute social purge and deleted my facebook and stopped replying to the little people who texted me. i left that job and actually started to address my severe depression and anxiety along with my weight issue as well. i went to the doctors and college. i tried to amend my very damaged relationship i had with my parents and sister. i sought the right treatment which lead me to a year recovery period where i lost pounds and try to practice healthy habits. i quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. i now wake up to ride my stationary bike for hours a day or go for very long walks. i currently work full ti ame at a job that i actually enjoy. i even have my own unit in a apartment building but the only hang up is that i have an extremely hard ti ame meeting new people or even talking to people it feels like i have all these ski wills to maintain myself so i avoid those cycles of depression and suicidal thoughts but gained no social ski wills at all. i freeze up and all those self defeating and self doubtfulness loathing thoughts come washing over my like a tsunami. therefore i tend to avoid crowds and gatherings. the issue my problem is that i feel like a stranger in a town i literally spent the most amount of my life in. i have no friends at all and the loneliness has been fueling my recent growing depression. i feel as if years of work is slowly unraveling itself. i have tried apps pof tinder etc and what not but honestly i was quickly thiscouraged when i literally had no replies other than bots and escorts. i am left a sense of hopelessness even at someone somewhat young. i feel like my twenties has been a waste and trying to be the lone wolf in life is turning out to be something i do not want. i just want to find genuine people to hang out with and talk to. i have no idea where to start. i could really use some help rebuilding a social life and honestly find someone special... again sorry if the post is too long or whatever i just really needed to vent. maybe my expectations are too much for myself and i should be satisfied with just being here at the present moment but the loneliness really is starting to a sink hole that i am finding it to be harder and harder to cli amb out of... tl dr military veteran with ptsd major depression anxiety and absolutely no social ski wills in desperate need of help in relationship building.	not depression

i am tired this is just going to be a rant, it is how it has to come out i guess. i am just tired. tired of being alone, tired of being sad, and just tired of being tired of that makes sense. i just feel like i have no one, i do not feel comfortable around anyone, i do not have a connection with anyone. i thought i did i never used to think this way until the last year and a half. my friends that i have had my whole life i sti will talk to and hang with but it is just not the same. i try to talk to them about this but they do not really understand it. my family i do not know they are family but again there is no connection i guess. the only person i am close to is my brother, since we were all each other had for the longest ti ame. i guess that is why i feel alone because he found his true love and does not need me as much anymore. which brings me into my next problem that always clouds my brain. i am and have never had a girlfriend or done anything until last weekend. and last weekend was a hook up which i realized is not for me, i guess i want something true even if it is not the one. but i feel like no matter what i do no girl even sees me that way. i have been talking to the girl i hooked up with but it is pretty clear that is all it was and for some reason my mind can not let me leave it at that. so yeah this was just a rant but i do not know i just feel like there is nothing for me, i am not suicidal i mean i thought about it but i am scared of death so i wouldn t try it. but who knows much more of this emptiness might change something.	not depression
what do i do about my shitty ass fucking life? i have basically no social life. i work and live alone. my closest family member is an hour away. they never come to see me i always have to go to them. i basically work, sleep, eat, smoke, and sit on my ass. i can not keep a boyfriend because i am boring as shit and would not have sex with them. i just feel like i live in a dark and lonely hole. what should i do about my shitty life? i do not think i have ever been happy. i am just a bad luck person. help?	not depression
big emotional rollercoaster in the span of a few minutes. warning, very personal. i was watching a tv show just a few minutes ago probably longer ago, this took a while to write out , and there was a scene that came up where a girl was expressing her frustration about not being able to hug or touch her friends and family because of a condition that she had. i understood what it was like to want a hug or to be touched by someone, but i can not hug or touch them because of thistance or fear of annoying them. hence, my emotional ass started tearing up. then my little sister notices i say little, but she is old enough by now to know that personal boundaries exist , and she gets all close to me, looking at my face. i ask her what she is doing, obviously annoyed because i am already about to cry. she says to me looking at your face, it looks like you re going to cry. she expressed no concern, and it even felt like she was picking on me. i got angry and yelled at her to get away from me. i told her that if someone looked like they were going to cry, you probably should not get up in their face and point it out to them. she ran off to tell mom like that is going to do shit, and i sat there with all of my anger. she tells mom that apparently i am the asshole for telling her the last thing i want people to do when they notice me about to cry is to point it out and make fun of me for it. this pissed me off even more, and i went up to my room. did the whole edgy teenager thing where i shut off the lights, locked the door, swore up a storm for a minute, then crawled into my bed to have a good cry because i can not go around breaking things in my house. felt like i should not be loved because i get pissed at my family for the smallest things, felt shitty for acting like a little bitch, and cried some more. i felt like i did not deserve love at all, and that i should just stay in my dark room without any physical contact for the rest of my life because i am an ugly and sensitive piece of shit. started breathing heavily because every ti ame i tried to calm myself down by thinking about someone holding me, telling me everything is ok, i felt like i did not deserve it, and i guess i kinda panicked? i managed to calm down enough to write this out, even though i am sti will crying a little. god, i am so over dramatic. i do not understand why this happened, it could be teenage hormones fucking with me. i would say it is period problems, but i do not think my period was that long ago. i do not fucking know, just going to post this because i feel it applies.	not depression

lost my gf, dont know what i am going to do basically to sum up this horrible story is that for the past years, i have been a toxic, unlovable, thisgusting person. i neglected her and her love and cheated on her. childhood sexual trauma and plenty of other trauma to follow suit and havent done therapy or talking to my family about any of it until like december . we have been trying to work through things for the past about months but tonight she announced she doesnt want to date me and can not see herself forgiving me and just all around can not give me her heart because i broke it. i have had a history of cutting but once my nasty coping problems kicked in, i stopped cutting at and just became a severely toxic person. cut myself a couple weeks ago, felt good. but now that she is done with me, i literally have no reason to live. i lost everything. i would like to end it all but have been too scared in the past. i feel that fear thissipating though. you just know when you have lost a love so unique and profound, that nothing wi will ever amount to it again. going to start practicing letters until i feel like its right.	not depression
asking for help from professors? i do not know if this is the right place for this but i do not really know what to do i am a student in university and have been going through one of my worst depressive episodes in a long ti ame i am bipolar . i have not been able to get out of bed for days except to pee and i have only eaten rice cracker in days and i feel so hopeless and useless. i have not felt this bad since last year and i i ammediately was sent to the hospital then. this week is finals and i have kind of resigned myself to failing my classes. one final is a demanding project that i have not started and the other is an exam i know i am going to fail because i did not go to class for weeks. i was wondering what the hell i can do. i want to do well but it feels like right now i would rather stop breathing. i emailed a professor from a different class and she was wi willing to give me ti ame. the final was a research paper and i told her straight up that i am struggling and i can not do the assignment so an f is ok. she told me she wi will mark the class as incomplete so i wi will have three weeks into the next quarter to turn in the assignment and hopefully that gives me ti ame to recover. it was honestly the nicest thing someone has done for me in a while. i do not know if i can do that for other classes? i feel like it looks like i am lazy if i email out of professors that i am sad so i should get special treatment. i worry they would not believe me and i am worried it wi will look really bad on my transcript to have incompletes and an f. that is all they can do because i am not registered with thisabilities resources. i tried but they have not gotten back to me i do not know if they wi will. i feel so dumb and useless. i am first generation in college and my family believes in me so much and i am such a failure. i just do not know what to do	not depression

my school just closed down for a month so. no idea what i am going to do while dealing with my demon like little siblings for a month, but in terms of not going crazy because of isolation...yah i think i have got that covered. i never leave my room, let alone my house. i would rather do all my assignments by myself anyway, it is not like i can not email my teachers with questions. so, my depression combined with being an introvert has really prepared me for this whole coronavirus thing. i already take online college classes, so it is not like it is anything new to me. however, i have not had therapy in a month, due to scheduling issues and employee training, and now it wi will be at least weeks until my school reopens. my therapist is through the school, she comes to the school for my sessions, along with a bunch of other kids. i was supposed to have a session tomorrow, but now that is not happening...this is not going to be good. last ti ame i went two months without therapy i got to a pretty bad state where i was very suicidal. i would really rather that not happen. it is annoying, if nothing else.	not depression

been a rough few months... but i am hopeful as ever. even if this truly is it. in the past couple of months i have been through a lot... parents divorced mom lost her job girlfriend broke up with me not to mention this is my senior year of college. the most recent thing to happen is my girlfriend splitting up with me. it is been just over weeks and i have been devastated. after it happened, i decided to just start living again. just start having fun without her and thistract myself. of course i sti will miss her. of course i sti will love her. but i have to enjoy myself as best i can, as i only have months left of college life. or at least that is what i thought. this coronavirus throwing a wrench in the works really messes everything up. i wi will more than likely have to finish school online, and then i am graduating. just like that. so, in order to avoid the i amminent loneliness and depression from quarantining for the next month or so, i have decided the next days are my final hurrah. i have a flight to florida that leaves in hours. i could not be more excited. i have never been able to go to florida before as i grew up in a lower middle class family in new york. as a matter of fact, the furthest i have ever been from home is my college in new hampshire. i have been working a lot lately and flights were of course super cheap. so my best friend and i decided to go down and stay with another friend who has a house down there. if the coronavirus is truly as dangerous as they say it is, i am not in the least bit worried. if it ki wills me, it ki wills me. at least i wi will die knowing that i made a decision to go somewhere i have always wanted to go. at least i wi will die knowing i did not die sitting by myself and sulking about how much i hate my life. at least i wi will die knowing that i had a great ti ame doing it. because for as long as i can remember, i have not been happy with myself or my life. i do not see myself fixing this issue in the future. this is why i do not care if coronavirus is truly as lethal as people are saying. if it ki wills me, i can truly die content knowing that i wi will no longer lay up at night with crippling thoughts about my future and whether or not i wi will be a success. no longer wi will i suffer in this life of malcontent. it is a little freeing, knowing that i could potentially never see anyone i love ever again. and those same people would probably look at my decision and say hey, the flight was cheap. he is a young kid who made an i ampulse decision. but the truth is, so many of us, including myself, have reservations about suicide because we know there are people who d be devastated if we went through with it. but what if it was not viewed that way? it seems to me as if the stars have aligned perfectly for me to die doing something i have always wanted to do. mostly due to my depression, i have not been known to live life to the fullest. especially not within the past year, given everything that is happened to me. but if i die living life to the fullest, well then there is just no other way i would want to go out 	not depression
learning acceptance my personal thoughts. i am young and i know that one day i wi will die and it wi will be like i never existed. my body wi will decompose into the ground. everything i ever did in life wi will not matter anymore. in years people wi will piss on my grave. my depression is within me. it is inside my brain. it makes me feel like a zombie like i am incapable of love. i surround myself with shitty people who treat me like shit, no respect at all. i do drugs to make myself feel worthy, otherwise tbh i feel like a burden, to everyone around me. it is fucked up, but i know i am going to die young, probably late twenties honestly. i am ok with that. see i do not see a point in finishing high school. going to college. and then i got to work hours a week, to just barley scrape by? fuck that. i do not see a point in that if i am just going to die one day anyways. id rather have fun, even if that means being a drug addict. i never fit in anywhere else, as soon as i found drugs i kinda fell in love, i wi will never be able to live sober, that would be fucking horrible!	not depression
i eat copious amounts of food to feel something good. i think i am dying. i go to sleep thinking the chance of me waking up is sli ammer and sli ammer. i want to stop, but i uncontrollably crave for happiness.	not depression

i am fucking stupid i keep watching videos of anjmals dying bc its the only thing that wi will make me cry anymore otherwise i am completely empty. i hate that i have opinions and feeling bc neither of them matter and i shouldnt be upset that ppl dont care. i am always making myself out to be the victi am when everythings my fault. i am such a terrible person. i keep getting called selfish bc i dont care if i get the virus or not. i should just ki will myself even if i dont want to die. i dont deserve love or respect in any form. i do not matter in any way whatsoever. all i do is sleep and eat and whine and complain aboht how horrible everything is. i am so shitty. i am really realizing that seriously dont deserve to be happy at all. i am so stupid. the dumbest shit makes me mad. i am actually so so so terrible. all i do is make ppl mad. fuck me for ever even thinking abot getting help. i dont deserve this. i dont deserve to have a roof over my head or food to eat or a loving family. i deserve hatred and pain. i really truly believe that here is nothing likeable abot me at all and it makes sense that ppl jus tget annoyed at this point when i complain. holy shit. i shouldnt even let it out here. i should just let everything build up. nobody has to hear this. its pointless. what the fuck am i who the fuck am i and why do i fucking exist if all i do is upset people.	not depression
i feel like i have never really helped anyone. my whole life i have always had some kind of hero complex. i wanted to be there for people and to be wanted and respected for it, but i have always failed. my first big failure i was only . my neighbor was a girl who quickly became my best friend because of proxi amity, we were the only two houses in the area the rest were cheap motels. so we would hang out pretty much daily and play games mostly ones emulating tv characters which usually put me in a hero and her in a damsel in thistress situation. well the whole ti ame we were friends she was regularly being raped by one of her dad is friends, as were her siblings. so great hero work there. after a few years our houses were both torn down to build a supermarket, i did not see her again til high school and she could barely stand to ever look at me. my mom was an alcoholic, manic depressive, had a rare genetic thisorder and plenty of other problems. she was irresponsible and i tried to keep her on track, playing the parenting role from a young age. i never managed to actually keep her on track. she ended up dying from i willness at , if i had actually managed to get her to stop even one of her bad habits, smoking, drinking, hell drinking pepsi...maybe she wouldn t be dead and i wouldn t be alone. i joined the coast guard because i wanted to finally be able to help someone. six years i did not do anything to help anyone except my superiors in the coast guard. no lives were saved by anything i worked on or was a part of in six years. not even by proxy, my entire unit did not do shit to help anyone, it was a combat focused unit. now the closest thing i have to a social life is posting on reddit. giving advice to people, someti ames ones who did not ask it. advice that is probably useless because it is coming from me, someone who is a mentally i will failure that is barely ever been able to function in society. the fuck do i know? i do not even leave the house. i did used to give my excess dumpster diving stuff to homeless people, that is the most i have done to help anyone in my life that i can think of. it is not enough, and it was years ago.	not depression
work told me to stay home for weeks, but due to li amited infrastructure also says only essential employees are to access work server. fiscal year end is coming up, and i have no other work to do. as title says, i can not access work server but all my work is tied to fiscal year end which all programs are on work server . i am anxious because i feel like i have nothing to work on, for the weeks. boss sent an email out friday advising us of the above, but stressed that this is not a vacation. well for me, it is a forced vacation because i can not do my job. i am admin, but can not do anything else adminy like scanning because i would need to physically be in the office and have access to server. right now, all my admin tasks have been focused on fiscal year end paying bi wills, making sure our orders come in on ti ame, etc . i just do not know what i am supposed to do for the next weeks and feel stressed because i can not do anything i normally would, working from home, so i am going to look like i am slacking off when everyone else in the office was able to find stuff to work on. guess i am just ranting, more than looking for advice. but any little bit of advice is helpful.	not depression
everything going on in my life is just making me feel very thiscouraged and worthless. i feel like i have bad luck or something. i am the only common denominator in my life, so it must be me who is the problem. i want to be a normal functioning adult. why do the most basic things have to be so hard??? removed 	not depression
tonight is depression rant i am pissed at both my parents for making me take responsibilities for their divorce problems as a kid. i am also agry because i v unconsciously learned their unhealthy behaviors anxiety x . i am pissed they have tought me to not be too proud of myself to not make others sad. and i hate my mom for making me hate men for years. kids are like sponges. they see and adopt common behaviors their parents have. i am stuck in this shit because of them and now giess what? none of them wants to take responsibility for their own mistake giving birth to me . i hate my mom for kicking me out, then saying i should be grateful to her and i am thisappointed in my dad who pretends it wi will all be better if i go outside for a few minutes each day. i do not have the worst family, and i can not i amagine how other must feel, because this is enough for me to breakdown ad wish for my life to end.	not depression
the covid pandemic is terrible, but it kind of amazes me how there is so much attention paid to it when it comes to a someti ames fatal, infectious thisease, there seems to be an endless amount of news articles every day from all angles such as what is the mortality rate, how is the thisease affecting the stock market, how it is affecting the usa presidential elections, etc., but when it comes to things like depression and adhd, i can not help but feel neglected in comparison now. like society is putting so much effort into stopping covid through panic buying, hygiene and online working, but it seems like there is a lot less done for mental health i willnesses in comparison. i mean, i do believe that covid is quite a severe, serious problem for humanity as a whole, but mental health problems are severe and serious too and yet society does not appear to halt its ways to alleviate mental health issues. rant over.	not depression
made my dad cry my dad accidentally read my diary and he cried when he saw what i wrote. and he cried when he told me he just wanted to help me and he did not know how. he said he hates the way i think of myself and he just wants me to feel ok.	not depression
feel free to message for a chat wherever you find yourself, feel free to send me a message for a chat. i have been through multiple suicide attempts and have lived through the depression. i am sti will getting my life together slowly but know what it is like to be hopeless. chatting to a stranger can help, there is no judgement at all. shut your eyes and keep going through it. i can not believe i am the one saying this now but there is another side to the darkness.	not depression

why can not i talk to people i can not talk to my friends because i am the funny one and everything i say is a joke to them so i can not be taken seriously about anything. i am just the punching bag of the group because i act like i do not care when people insult or tease me. i can not talk to other people who i am not close with either because i am so fucking awkward and i do not know how to have a normal conversation with people. i know that i wi will never get a girlfriend because i do not look good and i am not the slightest bit outgoing so i pretty much remind myself that there is no point in getting nervous around girls anyways because they do not like me. i just wish people would talk to me as a regular person and not treat me like i do not have feelings too. i know that nothing matters and that we are all going to die with no trace anyways but i sti will get nervous when around girls that i have tricked myself into thinking that they like me. i know this is going to happen until the day i die and then people wi will act like they were close to me and how it was such a tragic death. no one cares about you unless they gain something out of being around you. i do not have the power to live anymore. there is no point to anything so why does everyone act like life has meaning. i wi will probably die before i graduate from school so i do not have to think about the future anyways. nothing is fun anymore.	not depression

of course i am fine! i am just tired. no i am not fucking ok. i have not felt contact from anyone other then my parents my entire life, i am starved of attention, the only girl i liked has stopped starting conversations with me and all i can do is ask how her day was or how she is while i watch the only friendship i truly cared for fall apart every second. i have not been able to cry in over a year and i have not cared for anything more then her, i miss talking to her, i miss seeing her. i am a mess and i do not even know how i can stay alive, people have it worse then me but i am being selfish complaining about my problems that are nothing compared to anyone else s. i use my depression as a joke but i am not even fucking funny, i am nothing special, i would not be anyone special. i sti will can understand how this is my life, i would not become a super hero, or any hero, i would not save the galaxy or world, i wi will off debt for the rest of my life while ti ame marches on until i am forgotten and wi will have done nothing to advance humanity.	not depression
ready for the world to end even though reactions are being considerably blown out of proportion, the reactions to the coronavirus are making me giddy. i ran around on friday evening looking for toilet paper at my mom is behest. seeing the bare shelves in many of the stores i went to made me grin and almost laugh. i feel like kirsten dunst is character in melancholia while the rest of the world panics at the i ampending doom, i am becoming more serene.	not depression

i do not know how much more i can handle. this is going to be a long post because in order for you to realize the depth of everything i have to start from where everything started going wrong which was . i was in , me and my family were estranged except for the people who lived in my house, and my fathers parents. so it is other people as a support system. i started homeschooling a little before this point. my mom was getting sicker and was bed ridden and i remember waking up on january st with the intent of everything going back to normal and me helping everything smoothly. by the end of it i could not walk without crying. i went through blood tests plenty of mri is some with radiation some without and it they came down to....absolutely nothing. they never found out what was wrong with me and after months of physical therapy they stopped and never fixed my problem....my pain tolerance grew but every step i take hurts to this day. but lets back track a bit to the first week of , one morning my dad came home and he was silent which was alerting. my mother and i were both in her bed together drawing and resting and he told me that my beloved grandmother died and just minutes later my mom would go in for a blood draw and biopsy. so my siblings and i sat in the car well we waited for my mom and dad to come back out of the hospital, i did not know for a week or two more but my mother breast cancer and had a surgical removal later in the year. that is all my trauma for . this year i had depression and different eating thisorders but i met the most i amportant person in my life and one of my best friends who we ll call thomas, she has helped me beyond believe wi will all my mental health issues and its probably the only reason i am around. we met and talked often and she helped me but my parents all through this were reading my messages and learned everything i said, about my self harm and everything and instead of helping me they yelled at me for hours, invalidating my feelings tell me that i was copying her and that i did not have any issues. they started yelling more at me for not cleaning the entire house or doing everything their list said to do. but i got through it. my parents seperated me from my friend but after a little ti ame i tracked her back down on the internet and were sti will really close. at the start of this year i met this guy he seemed really nice and we were together for months before he tried to use me. he tried forcing me into sexual situations and it got really out of hand so i kept my mouth shut and broke up with hi am. my parents started yelling more at me and my father even called me a fuck up and failure. by the end of the year i was ready to enter the dating pool again and i met this new guy and when shit started to fall apart i realized how wrong i was about hi am after i found out he was cheating on me with other girls. my best friend of years moved away because her parents could not finance the area anymore this year i was just so destined to live better but my life does not operate like that. my parents started taking trips for a couple days and its always so hard when they get back but this was the worst moment of my life. my sister was having trouble sleeping and then he yelled at her and my parents got into a fight and my dad hit my mom. after that moment i am not sure how i am suppose to get on...now i do not feel like myself and i can not look at myself in the mirror...i do not recognize the person i do not know if its depersonalization depression or gender dysphoria all i know its i covered all the mirrors because i could not stand it anymore i hate my long hair but my dad calls it his head which makes my mom so mad but what am i suppose to do. it took me years to convince hi am to let me get my first hair cut. its hard to sleep i usaully only get or hours a night and i barely can stand having to talk to people. after everyday i lock myself in my room and just lie on my floor and cry for a few hours. i have tried to convince my parents i need help but they think its all fake. even after they saw my self harm marks. i am not sure how i could make it through the next . years....they always target me, my sister is the golden child and they buy her stuff and she never has to clean i just do not know how to go on when it feels like the weight of everything is on my chest and dieing would be easier. i can not do any of this anymore its too much. can anyone help me ? i want to keep living but its so hard when i can not even be myself.	not depression
i have always had mild depression, but the passing of my pet parakeet has made it significan notly worse i feel like a bitch for crying over my little parakeet, but i loved hi am so much. he was one of the only things that brought me joy in the world we currently live in. now i feel like utter shit and i can not stop thinking about it. every ti ame i see a date of something before his death i think about how much ti ame i had from that date up until his death and it makes me wonder what is coming next. my classes were canceled for coronavirus and i am being burdened with a shit ton of work on top of grieving over the loss of my beloved pet. it also does not help how my family members do not seem to care because he was just a parakeet and not something like a dog. this is the worst i have ever felt mentally. i miss hi am so much and my house and heart feel empty	not depression

can not do this isolation i live in nyc. had a bad bout with depression a couple of years ago but have been doing better. until this past week. i already hate this city and do not want to be here but have to for work. now i can not see what few friends i have. fine, i wi will go to a show. can not do that. ok, i wi will go grab some food and a drink. can not do that either. then i wi will watch sports at my apartment. nope, none of that. the walls of my apartment are already closing in. it is a small studio and i am losing my mind. i can not do this city like this. it is like de blasio is trying to make me lose it. every day he takes away another thing that is keeping me sane. this has to end. i can not do one more night being trapped in this tiny ass apartment. if i had a car i would take a drive, but nope, can not have that either living in this horrendous town. and i work in healthcare. so while everyone else gets to just not work for the next few weeks i am getting shat upon. and wi will get sick at some point. i just can not do this. i want to go out with my friends and be a real person for a few hours, but this effing city is instead choosing to ruin our lives.	not depression
not sure if tonight is my night currently this is the farthest i have gone. i have always had this vision of me sitting in my bathtub with a shot gun and finally just ending it. at the moment i am in the tub with my shotgun and a shell sitting on the tub edge. well see what happens tonight. i do not want to die but i also dont want to live with my brain the way it is.	not depression
life am not right i swear my mind is melting at this point. i am sitting here in my room while visiting family in tx, i am from florida on spring break. every day draws closer to me going back home and i honestly do not want to do it. i do not want to go back to worrying about what my future wi will entail. i was denied to almost every college i applied to, i am interested in computer science and i wanted to do cyber security for the military but it looks like that is going to fall through. i do not want to go back, it eats at me to go back to that shitty state. i just want to move here and work on a ranch ti will i die if i could, but that si amply would not work as that is not the path i truly want. it feels everything i have worked for has led to me being denied. i feel like a god damn failure even though i try my hardest but the struggle chunks away my sanity slowly. i do not know what i am going to do for my future. i do not know where i am going to end up. it makes me so sad, the only thing i would want to go back for is my amazing girl who supports me. i do not want to go back to where my terrible family is and i do not ever want to deal with their drama ever again in my life. half of my mind is telling me to leave everything and start anew. the only person in my family that truly supports me, and i mean truly support not just words is my father who i admire. he does not help with this matter however. it feels like nothing ever works out, i am sorry for being all over the place it was just coming out as i thought it.	not depression
i think this one broke me my ex and i were together for four years. she was my best and only friend for so long. she broke up with me months ago because she could not cope with my depression anymore. the same week i was made redundant at work and unemployed. also, my car was written off by a bus. i got half the insurance payout due to some loophole in the contract. anyway it is been pretty on and off for the last few months with me being friendly then trying to rekindle our friendship at least followed by her getting a new boyfriend i only found out about when i caught my friends lying to me.. i was hospitalised psychiatric that night.... she then broke up with hi am because he did not know she sti will talked to me. she seemed to care when i nearly died but now has gone back to a new tinder boyfriend. this ti ame she is blocked me and i do not know how to cope. it is breaking me.	not depression

when i am talking with friends. i constantly thinking what are we talking?what is the point? i do not have many friends. maybe none. i have people i can occasionally talk. when life gets unbearable i try to talk with people. and in few minutes i just feel why am i doing this. this is pointless. i feel i can always find a reason not to hang out to like talk to a person. i constantly asking myself are things going to get better. i wish i can feel better. and like people more. and like a little bit more.	not depression
the reason i stopped participating in school sports i am a senior in highschool and the last ti ame i was in a school sport or club was sophomore year. i quit after people kept picking on me and making it a very toxic environment. when i thought i finally had been doing well in cross country and was eligible for my xc varsity lettering i never made varsity i was going to get the letter for it but they changed the requirements day of awards ceremony . after that it was my last straw and i gave up. i played private esport teams but that even more toxic. i quit those and hate myself for trying to join or for giving up and leaving. i am pathetic either way.	not depression

i feel like i would have been better off if i were born female i am quiet, i am not very outgoing, and as a guy if you are not a social outgoing butterfly, you get left behind and no one cares about you. sure, women can benefit from being outgoing and social but if you are not as a woman, you would not be left behind and forgotten. it blows my mind that women are treated almost like celebrities in a way. people guys want to meet women and talk to them without even knowing who they are. if i do not talk to anyone, no one talks to me. if i do not make the effort to reach out first, no one reaches out to me. there is a girl at work who gets hit on by everyone. she has her choice in whoever she wants to hang out with, sleep with, date, etc. i am pretty sure she is in the job she is right now because she is a pretty face too. and she is not even all that pretty. just a girl who knows how to do make up and smile. there are a lot of downsides to being a woman, i get it. but with my personality i just think i would have been better off female. i am not trans or anything, i would never transition, it is just something i think about a lot.	not depression

i think i have adhd f tonight my mom and i were thiscussing all of my current struggles, spending the last years being suicidal, and how a lot of things i had issues with as a kid that everybody thought would go away have only exacerbated my extreme forgetfulness, procrastination, losing things that i use everyday, etc. . i then recalled an article i had read a while ago about adults with adhd and how i had related to a lot of it, but did not think that anybody would believe me at the ti ame, so i never mentioned it to anybody. after all, only kids get diagnosed with adhd, right? and i had good grades growing up and was never hyperactive so i could not have it, right? well. after sending my mom a few articles to read to see if i was crazy for relating so much, she told me that she started crying while reading them because every single thing she read aside from the hyperactivity was something that i had struggled with my entire life, and had frequently stressed about to her, including my anxiety and depression. she told me she felt like she understood now why i could never stick with a habit, and why her seemingly si ample solutions for things i was struggling with weren t working like how using calendars do not help me remember things i need to do because i forget to look at the calendar, or how she had to buy me two tracking devices for my wallet and keys because i was losing them so often that i was starting to break down and cry and get angry at myself the moment i misplaced them again, and then i lost one of the tracking devices, or how no matter how many ti ames i organize my things by the end of the week my room is a thisaster again . obviously there is a lot more that i have experienced or struggled with that relate to adhd or i wouldn t be so convinced that i might have it, but this would be a much longer post than it is already if i were to copy paste all of my notes about it here. now, i am not self diagnosing, i am seeing a behavioral specialist on tuesday for my depression and anxiety already. but now i have a huge list of things relating to adhd that honestly really give me hope that there might be a new beginning in sight. if i truly have it, it explains almost every single major stressor that i have had in my life. even if i do not have it, i really hope that i can get some answers on tuesday.	not depression

 you so smart, why do not you so? people left right having been saying that i am smart and mentally strong. my parents said so, my uber driver said so, even my lectures and friends. the truth is, i am just a person with my own problems, i am not smart in a way they expected i am. my parents used to have anger issues and they took it out on me, let alone that i only meet them hours per day, it is mostly beatings. my siblings teamed up and shit on me for some reason but at least they have changed now well that happened when i was young thus leading me to over think any criticism i receive. basically i can not perform what people expect me to do, not high and mighty as people think i am. i have tried explaining but they refuse to listen. i have tried to meet their expectations but my efforts did not pay off, studied hours straight everyday for months just to score half of the full score while everyone is ace ing it. that is why i am toxic in game to release stress out. but lately games mean so little to me, i do not feel like talking socialising with people because it also getting boring. i am at a state where i do care about things but i somehow do not want to. this feeling hits me when something i ampactful happens to me hey, maybe it is just me right. i hope someone can shine a light for me to walk here	not depression

sick of the ups and downs i was feeling good for a while when i took abilify. things finally felt normal for the first ti ame in my entire life. i really think it was the one ti ame ever i felt what other people feel happiness as. then i started getting some pretty horrible rare side effects and now i have been off it for a few weeks and i am back to severe depression. i just want it to stop already. even if i just felt less severe depression i would be fine. i do not need to ever feel that normal person happiness ever again even. i just do not want to be this low. someti ames i wish i could ki will myself, but i do not have the balls to thisappoint my family more than i already have. plus i have a thisabled mother to take care of.	not depression

i wish i could make new good friends, i am so alone, just a outburst i have incredible virtual friends, they make me laugh, they care for me and everything, but it is far from having a person by your side, i am very alone, i wanted so much, but so much to have more friends, to go out, to have company, having a shoulder to cry on, hugging and everything, i am grateful for the friends not virtual, there are that i have, but they are never wi willing to do this kind of thing, always busy and we see each other from ti ame to ti ame, i i feel so alone i wanted to go out and have some fun, there is so much i wanted to do in a group, i miss everything that we used to do together, virtual friends are good but is far from what i need now where i live it is hard to have someone who fits me i have panic attacks, anxiety and depression but, i always hide this from ppl xd , i wanted to have opportunities to meet new people, i have tried so many things, i just dont want to be alone	not depression

covid and a college student it is very hard in ti ames and situations like this to remain calm. i am a student from georgia, and my university extended spring break another week, so two weeks off. i am currently freaking out about it. i am employed by my university but as a student worker. that therefore qualifies me as non essential, which basically means for as long as this thing is here, i wi will not be receiving a check or getting payed. there is is a possibility my university wi will extend this break to the rest of the year, putting all students in online classes. this is a terrifying situation to me because like many others, i live pay check to paycheck. i am a regular adult with credit card bi wills, car note, insurance, rent etc. how wi will all of these be payed within the next month if the entire united states it practically at a standsti will? i currently have dollars . in my bank account, a few cans of food, and one new pack of toilet paper that i nearly had to fight someone over. i cried today because the amount of money related stress that i am going through is getting to my head. can anyone provide me with some advice? this virus seems to have no end in sight. my anxiety is going through the roof and it probably would not be coming back down anyti ame soon. how does the us government plan to elevate the hardships people are going through because of this? how can we live in a country where someone not just me, but many others has to worry about their entire livelihoods coming to a screeching halt if one paycheck does not show up? this is insane. advice?	not depression

feeling exceptionally down this week...the world seems to have gone crazy i suffer from depression, anxiety and adhd. my husband and i were supposed to leave a week from tomorrow to go to thisneyland for a much needed vacation. i just left a very stressful job and it was the light on my horizon. not to sound like the most out of touch person in the world, but when thisneyland closed and our vacation got postponed, it really brought me down. we found out thursday and i felt really down and deflated, crying at the drop of a hat. i thought, i can not be this much of a child, crying over my thisneyland plans. the following day, friday, i started my period, which i felt explained why i was feeling so down and emotional. but over the weekend, the depressed feeling has persisted. in every corner of the internet, everyone is talking about the coronavirus, either in memes trying to lighten the mood or in tips of what to do while being isolated. every store in a hundred mile radius is out of almost everything, so i am not going shopping, even for things i need, because they are not there. i feel suffocated, like the world is teetering and spinning out of control. and i do not know where the end is. when wi will social media, shopping, our vacation, our whole world, seem to return to some semblance of normalcy? so i feel my depression settling in, from my hormones, from canceled plans, from nothing outside being normal. nothing interests me....tv, books, movies, games, everything just seems boring and like it would take much more energy than i have. anyway, i just wondered if anyone felt this down, depressed feeling from feeling bombarded and out of whack.	not depression

the one ti ame that i actually need to sleep, i can not. when the anxiety is not too bad, i can sleep at least two or three hours per night, and thanks to depression, i can lie in bed all day with no problem other than the usual aches and pains. today, though, i just can not get any sleep. i have work in the morning. i have to get up in three hours. yet i am lying in bed counting the raindrops as they hit my window and the number of idle beeps that the smoke alarm makes. i hate that i am like this.	not depression
my three years relationship ended and i can not calm myself she broke up with me. i was not helping her with her problems, even tho i tried. i was just bad at this. she told me, that she was in relationship with me, not because she loved me, but she wanted to sacrifice herself, so noone wi will have such shitty boyfriend. i can not calm myself, i feel like i need to vomit. i am thinking about ki willing myself. she does not pick up her phones, and i can not go visit her, because she lives in other city	not depression
should of never trusted hi am. so a while back i decided that i wanted to move back to my home town which is half way across the country. the reason being is that my sister is husband had past away from cancer leaving her and my year old niece alone in this world. i suffer from severe depression and i realized that i wanted to be around the family and help her out, spoil and take care of my niece etc. during my planning to move back, my father offered me a job working for his construction company building, flipping and repairing houses. i was pretty reluctant as my father and i do not have good history. but i did figure it would help me get settled in. i also was looking for a place to rent and was talking to my mother about a few places around the town. my father then suggested that i move into one of the houses that they have not started on yet and wouldn t be working on for a year. he wanted me to work on the house in my spare ti ame while also watching after the place to make sure that no one broke into it since they were storing tools and materials in the house. after thinking about it i decided to take hi am up on his offer and so i moved across the country and into the house. set up my bed and unpacked the basic essentials. i decided to keep the rest of my stuff in the boxes as i did not want to get dust on anything and because i was planing to move into another place during the summer. so i worked for my father and after the first payday he lets me know that his credit card info was stolen and someone took over dollars , . he says he can pay everyone but one person ti will he gets his insurance for the card taken care of, which should be done next week. he asked if he could just add the money on to my next pay check and would put it in the bank account. i am thinking that i am not hurting for money since i saved up for the move and had money in the bank for a few months. so i said yeah that is fine . it is family right... so next pay check rolls around and no money gets deposited into my account. my father is across country taking care of business for a few days, i can not get a hold of hi am. i had worked a lot of over ti ame helping hi am. after he flew back i went over to my parents house in the morning for breakfast and to talk with hi am. my mother was sitting down as i was grabbing some pancakes and i mention to hi am that i have not been paid yet. my mom looked dumb founded and said you have not been paid? . she looked at my father giving hi am a look. she figured i was being paid. he then said i can not afford to pay you at the moment . i asked hi am what do you mean you can not pay me, you said you would be putting the money in my account . my mom then replied, i think you should stop working for hi am ti will he pays you . i then said alright and finished eating before going back to the house that i was staying at and started looking for another job. my father stopped by the house later that afternoon and talked with me. he told me that i need to find another place to stay, i figured he was not happy that i mentioned he had not paid me in front of my mother and that she had talked to hi am. so i found a place to stay that night and brought some boxes over. since i wouldn t be able to use the haul trailer ti will the weekend was over i left my bed and other stuff at the house. early the next morning i headed over to the house to grab some more boxes and i notice a truck in the yard. i went inside the house and their was a stranger sleeping in my bed, using some of my stuff. i recognized hi am and he recognized me as we met along ti ame ago. he was a old friend of my dads that worked with hi am at the mine decades ago. he got up and started talking to me over some coffee. he mention that he came back in town yesterday for a funeral and ran into my father. my father then offered hi am a place at the house yesterday morning. he did not know it was my bed as my father did not mention it to hi am. he also mention that my father gave my money to my brother cause my brother was going through bankruptcy and need some extra cash to support the kids. so that is it. turns out my father kicked me out to give my bed to a old friend of his. gave dollars that he owed me to my brother. i later talked to my mother and she said that none of their info for any of their credit cards were ever stolen so he lied to me too. so i am out dollars . had to find another place to work and stay.	not depression
finally figured out what to do with my life i know this is only partially related to the sub, but heck, even if i die alone, i found out what is my purpose in life. currently, i would like to get into screenwriting. the only thing that i need to get rid of is living with my parents. it puts a very huge pressure on me, ki wills my creativity and i definitely need a place of my own. literally, i can not think straight. and i do not know where to go. currently i am thinking about getting a flat in my home country, then maybe going abroad and attend a screenwriting course the only problem with them is that they are too expensive.	not depression

religion and the death of god i grow more and more sorrowful in learning about assertions science presents in the field of physics and its inference on our free wi will. as i approach certainty about the possibility of determinism, i grow worried about losing my sanity in the face of an inescapable reality. all the sense of meaning that i have been endowed with feels constructed by previous misconceptions about the real world, especially that i come from a religious islamic background. i am sharing this to soothe the pain that comes with such a realization and hopefully find a community that shares the same type of existential pressures.	not depression

you ever feel sad just from seeing other people happy? it sounds fucked up but like, when i see people happy or having a good ti ame, i just feel so empty inside. especially like a nice couple or something that looks so happy and perfect together. that kind of stuff instantly just makes me feel lonely and empty. i wouldnt say jealousy, but i guess it also kinda is. its not like i dont like happy people or dont want others to be happy. i want them to be happy and like to see them happy and live their best life, it just hurts at the same ti ame.	not depression

wi will anyone even read this?... i mean, there are so many of us seeking some kind of help, or trying to reach out or just let it out. but how many of those attempts end up unnoticed? and i need to reach out as well. you see, i am battling with inferiority complex for years. i feel like i am not good enough, and those who even talk to me just waste their ti ame, because they can spend their ti ame with way better people or things than me. so, it comes as no surprise i never had a girlfriend. at least, not a official one. even if i felt something to a girl, it did not work out, because i am just no good in every aspect. and so i stopped trying. why would i? and lately, i met this one girl through one of the two people i dare to call friends, even if i do not understand why they sti will stick around. that guy is basically a complete opposite of me. he is attractice, funny, and always liked by basically everyone, and he is that kind of womanizer who can have any girl, do what he wants with her and then just leave her like that and find another. so basically, i started to spend ti ame with this girl i met thanks to hi am. we were chatting on daily basis, went out many ti ames, talked, and i felt good with her to my own surprise. and here i thought, maybe it is worth giving a shot. to try. and guess what? they went on a week long trip with that friend, he fucked her a couple ti ames, and is not interested in a relationship with her. and here she go, crying what she did wrong, and why do not he love her. i tried to tell her, that i know how he works and what he does. she did not listen. and me? i was never even an option for her. and i can not help but to be angry at myself for being so stupid and naive. someone shitty like me do not deserve love. i know what, yet i allowed myself a sliver of hope. maybe i should made a different decision those years ago when it all could have end for me.	not depression

dealing with depression during remote working i am a software developer working in central london. amid all of the covid fears, our small company has forced everyone to work remotely from today. i am currently thiscussing with the bosses, trying to stay working in the office very few people on the tube this morning, no one in office, i am young and if i were to catch it i would self isolate . personally, i do not enjoy working remotely. i like having a routine, an office to go to, a desk to sit at and the moment the morning commute, walking in the sun gives me that little bit of vitamin d that i require to feel half decent. how can i deal with this, i am fairly certain my bosses wi will be happier if i work from home, and i understand their point. if i am forced to work from home they suggest as a company, up to months then i wi will be required to leave the house very little and could see myself becoming very depressed	not depression

emotions are tearing me apart. this is more of a vent for the past year or two i really do not remember anymore or care to as it feels like a chore i have felt hopelessly depressed but kept it to myself most of the ti ame. over that span of ti ame i beat myself up over acting feeling like an asshole. i was always either pissing people off or making them worried about me which is not what i wanted i just recently found out that the girl i had been vibin for has actually had feelings for me for a decent while and was comforting me during a ti ame of need, telling me i was not an asshole and that i was the kindest person she knew. that was the happiest i have felt in a long ti ame. i feel a tiny bit better about myself now and really have had no one actually take any interest in me besides family. i now feel like the happiness i am feeling is acting as a combatant to the depression and it is tearing me apart, i feel like i am going insane.	not depression

just a little vent, by little i mean a whole paragraph. someone told me to fix my body clock since i go to sleep at in the morning every night, someone told me to get help because i was cutting and had so called depression . why do i need to though, i do not need to change and i do not need help, i am not an alien i am a human going through something right now, do not tell me that you have not had a point in your life where you have wanted to ki will yourself, well if you have not it is your turn next. i am living this sad, stressful life knowing that i could die tomorrow and i really wouldn t care less, every day i have to mask the depressed feelings with a smile, telling everyone and showing everyone i am okay . since i am sti will here, sti will alive, you may tell that i have some sort of hope in me, that everything wi will change for the better, that i wi will have a better life in the future, if i have a future. i am not saying everything is ok no need to be sad i am saying it is ok to be sad, not everything is going to be okay, you have just got to have a little hope in life, that is all . a little meaning out of . a lot of people did not have any hope and took their lives, but just know that that is keeping you alive right now, so make the best of the hope you sti will have, maybe it wi will change something in the future. have a little hope. but for now, my life is sti will very glum. 	not depression

practicing self isolation from my toxic family amid this virus i honestly thought this extended family ti ame would be super great, except it is really not, given that i am the only one currently unemployed even before this virus started everyone pretty much thinks i am that bum fucked up failure and this whole stay at home thing has given my older sisters an even better opportunity to jab at me for just about anything they could randomly come up with, blaming me and being really snarky for every possible angle and opportunity. this is great. really great. nothing like months of slow and painful freefall into guilt, shame, and mediocrity.	not depression

corona virus sucks... not the way you think. i have been depressed for close to years and have been medicated and going to therapy for about months. one part of my therapy type things is i was pushed to go out and be social or just get out of my house more. i go out every weekend with my boyfriend even if it is to walk around the mall or go to a park. now with my city the whole us is on quarantine and already not going out one weekend is throwing me back into my depressive headset where i just sleep for hours. i never realized how much these little outings help me and i feel selfish for even feeling like my happiness is more i amportant then all of the population at risk. i know the reason for these bans but i feel like i can not be alone in feeling this way. the feeling of being trapped sucks and i hope all this is solved quick for all being involved and affect by this. anyways stay safe and hope everyone is handling this better then me 	not depression
ever seen your friend ignoring you i always felt that i am a waste of everyones ti ame, always asking for forgiveness everyti ame i talk to them. i always see them, not replying to my chats, but i see their post online, they talking to their other friends. i always feel that i am alone, seeing them better off without me, even happier without me. the worst part about it, is that i saw them talking trash behind another friend of them, but when they talk to each other, they talk normal. and i am really scared that, that is happening to me. everyti ame i tell them that i am depressed, they always say that their here, but whenever i am good, or happy, or normal again, they leave and ignore me.	not depression
suffocating in a sea of people that can breathe. i remember an acquaintance of mine had depression, something that i was not too sure if i had, but i am just remembering what she posted on her social media at that ti ame, having depression is like being trapped underwater, downing, suffocating, while everyone else is breathing. i guess now that i think back to it, i kinda can understand it. it is like looking and seeing how everyone else is able to carry on comfortably with their lives while you re stuck where you are, not knowing where to go or how to go on even with a goal in mind. i just wanted to post to get my mind off things, and maybe just let y all know about this. if any of you kind souls could who have managed to somehow deal with it, maybe you could hit me up to offer some advice. i wi will do my best to respond if i am feeling up to it, so sorry in advance i may reply late or not at all, i just really need some help with this issue. i do not know what to do about this anymore.	not depression

a feeling of perpetual and static unbelonging. this is what these last days have been like, a sensation that tells me i am the odd, unfitting piece in every puzzle that exists. i do not have a world, a safe haven for myself, i let it all crumble. i feel like i have nothing to offer for my loved ones, workplace, or the world around me. all i do is consume resources and information like a black hole, sti will and indifferent. i often fantasized about ending it all, but all that did was make people upset, so i just quitted thinking about it too. i do not know why i am posting this.	not depression

i moved and now i am even worse i have been quite stable during the last couple of months, a few bad days here and there, a couple of bad moments but nothing long or too serious. last week, i moved out bc uni started and i fell down this dark hole really fast. i had trouble going to uni, talking to people instead of just isolating myself and i was not able to get anything done at all. when i came home for the weekend i slept over at my boyfriend is and i felt super weird, i felt super annoyed and isolated the whole ti ame and when he asked if something was wrong or whether i was having a bad day i just told hi am no. when i drove home, i had to stop because i was crying so hard. i was not having suicidal thoughts but instead the thought this person would miss you for this reason and this person would miss you for this reason popped into my head, completely unprompted. before, when i was really down, i could not cry because i just felt empty. yesterday i picked a fight with my boyfriend and i got super mad and even more sad. we re a bit in quarantine now here in germany, meaning we do not have school uni and all shops except for pharmacies, supermarkets and a few other places are closed and i feel really anxious bc i have to do all of the work for uni by myself while being like this.	not depression

need help with a depressed family member! some background to start off with my cousin is and in recovery from an eating thisorder anorexia and she is become suicidal and severely depressed. it is all she thinks and talks about. she is attempted suicide before and had been in a children is psych ward two ti ames this year for about a month in total. i was present for one of these attempts. she is tried multiple antidepressants at varying doses, mostly quite large ones but none have worked. she is self harmed a lot, despite her access to anything remotely sharp being taken away she seems to find new ways of doing it using sand paper etc. i just do not know how to help her. i am myself and have also experienced depression and suicidal thoughts but never to this extent. i try talk to her about looking for positive things etc but she is not taking it in and i think my help seems cliche to her. i am also studying in another county so i can not physically be there. she is not left alone at home usually. does anyone know how to help? i feel responsible for her life when she tells me about her feelings and it is destroying me because i feel so helpless. i am really close to her and she looks up to me to an extent. i remember when she was born and played with her looked after her a lot whilst growing up, so the idea of potentially having to attend her funeral someti ame soon is crushing me. if anyone has any advice on how to preserve my own mental health through this that would also be greatly appreciated. i hope i do not sound selfish mentioning myself so much, obviously the most pressing priority here is helping her. i would appreciate any help and advice at all! thanks 	not depression
there is nothing worse than being a year old male virgin why? because when you have some kind terminal i willness people atleast have sympathy for you. when you are a year old male kissless virgin people are just thisgusted by you, they wi will think you re an incel. people do not take you seriously, they can not comprehend the i ammense pain male virgins like me have to go through everyday. if they knew, they would have more respect for people like me. but instead all people can do is mock male virgins, society does not listen to male virgins their problems and their feelings. all they do is make us feel more insecure and inferior. society just wants male virgins like me to die a painful death, dying of a heart attack because of the constant emotional pain.	not depression

i think i am ready to call it a day m hi all, i am not quite sure how to start this, nor do i really know what i am expecting from posting here, but i think i am ready to give up. i have pretty much lost all that i care about in the past few months, the woman i love broke up with me due to many arguments, long thistance and maybe other reasons i dont know . my best friend doesnt speak to me anymore, and i am unemployed with honestly no idea as to where to go in my life and i dont even know if i want to. starting with the breakup, i dont think i wi will be able to ever love again, she became my everything and i lost it all. some days i find myself living through past memories as an escape from my situation at the moment because i can not help but miss her so much. she chose a life that didnt include me and i have taken it so personally even though everyone tells me not to. this happened months ago and i am nowhere near over it. i can not help but feel as if i was never going to be good enough for her and that i dont deserve to be with anyone better or be treated better, and it ki wills me. maybe i deserve to be alone. my best friend doesnt speak to me anymore and i am broken over that too. i find myself in the house unable to do anything productive, thinking about suicide all the ti ame and genuinely losing the wi will to get out of bed most days. i have always struggled being neurotic, but i have never been this low. the pain never stops, i wake up feeling shit about myself for losing my ex, for having no friends, not even a job at the moment. even though i have a strong degree and work experience, i can not even do that. i dont know where to turn, what to do, and even how to get myself out of bed to help myself. the relationship with my parents has been deteriorating and they want me out of the house too, i just ruin everything and everyone. i just got rejected from the job that i wanted today, which could have been my ticket out of this rut, but nope, again, i am not good enough for that either and honestly it doesnt surprise me anymore. i know my ex is doing better than me, is probably happier than me and i am a loser, i dont deserve to be happy. i want this all to end. i have no hobbies, no personality or interests and i feel like it is so much better if i just vanish. sorry for the ramble, but i dont know what to even do anymore. tl dr loser feeling sorry for hi amself over shit life	not depression

this is the note i want to leave to my family, a work in progress. does it make sense? do not try to comprehend why this happened. since you knew nothing about me you would only come to false conclusions. my state of mind was far beyond anything you would recognize. i spent years inside my own head consecutively thinking only about the bigger picture, so much so that everything in life became nothing but trivialities to me. i was apathetic towards life and everything felt like a chore. i had nothing to live for so i figured that i should take the next step and see what lies beyond this life. i saw the world from a profound perspective that rendered me incapable of focusing on living in a traditional sense. i was not motivated to live life in a way society would have wanted me to, i refused to be forced into a system that went against my nature. if i can not live life the way i want to, then why should i live at all? the only world i can be happy in is one where i can play god and have everything my way. why that is falls down to who i am as a person, i am si amply incapable of achieving happiness and a sense of satisfaction out of life. no matter how much i struggle to reach a peace of mind, i never wi will, not in this world where everything is based on uncertainty, where i am alone. there are so many layers to this existence, we may never find the truth about our universe in life. no one knows why we are here, everyone just keep living in their own lies. they make up their own excuse for slaving away at their jobs, only to find joy in their hobbies and pleasures. you might say that some are fortunate enough to enjoy working at their jobs, but the truth is, humans never settle for good enough . regardless of whether or not they like their jobs, they always want more, because deep inside they are never satisfied with life. people need goals in life. those who say they are satisfied with life are delusional, because they are not. the only reason they feel that way is because they have ambitions that they are working towards, and the progress and anticipation of reaching those goal is what gives them that feeling of satisfaction, the feeling of gaining more out of life. people who lack ambitions and goals in life become depressed and they feel hopeless unless they manage to find a reason to live again. i had ambitions but not even the thought of reaching my goals would make me happy, meaning i did not get that satisfaction of progress and anticipation, so in reality those ambitions were nothing more than false hope. false hope that i would one day be happy if only i could reach those goals, but i was smarter than that, i realized that even after reaching those goals i would sti will be left feeling empty and hopeless again because that is just who i was. to me everything was irrelevant and pointless, i cared only about the bigger picture. a classic case of existentialism some would say, except in my case i literally could not be happy in life no matter how hard i tried. the reason i was not happy in life was not because i lacked purpose, it was because nothing brought me enough joy and satisfaction to make my life worth it. the fact that people are not actively looking for the truth baffled me. i could never be content living such an ignorant existence. humans are not free, they are powerless. my quest was and is to find the truth and to achieve eternal happiness. clearly i could not find it in life, that is why i took this step. i may never find it, but it it is worth moving on either way since i was not happy in life. i hoped that you could at least gain some amount of understanding from this. i did love you all very much, and that is why this decision was harder than it should have been, i lived only for your sake. you were all i had. goodbye.	not depression

breakup shame so my college girlfriend of years broke up with me because she didnt like being with me anymore, because i am a bit short tempered. she meant alot to me and its been shitty months of me trying to cope with it. we had si amilar friend circle and now i dont feel like going out anymore. i avoid meeting my friends, make excuses even though i want to, because i feel ashamed for some reason. i feel ashamed that this happened in my life and can not accept it. its affecting my relationship with my parents at home and with myself, as a human. i can not seem to find happiness being in this environment..	not depression

everything is shutting down and i do not know what to do i am a full ti ame student and a part ti ame teacher for an after school elementary program where we teach music to kids. i am in washington state. my work and school have both been shut down until further notice and it is making me panic a little bit. i have bi wills that need to be paid and i currently have no way to pay them. no one around me is hiring because of the outbreaks in nearby towns. my kids need our program. not just the social interaction, but we re the last stop for nutritious food before they head home. a lot of my kids are lower class, they are surrounded by violence in their community, and they are have one less thing in the day to look forward to. for some of them our program is whats keeping them safe. music gives them something else and my mind is telling me that we re not going to be able to come back from this. without school how can i get a sense of productiveness? i am terrified and i feel like this social thistancing is going to start a spiral. i can not work, i can not go to school, i can not pay bi wills, i can not live. what can i do? besides relentlessly cleaning and reading books? what can i do for work? how can i pay my bi wills? how can i feel secure?	not depression
my mum hates me she says i am a failure and a mistake hello guys this is my first post here so to give context, i am a year old guy and have been on bad terms with my mum for the past months so it all started after holidays were i was tbh an asshole to them and did not appreciate what they planned for the holidays. i had a huge fight with my dad on this trip because i and my dad have nothing in common and can not talk like normal people. they were very thisappointed in me after this holidays. after the holidays my grades went down in school and i did not know what to do and have not told anyone yet. i have so much to do. i have also become a lot of migraines lately because of the stress. today my mum overreacted because i got confused about something. she started screaming at me and sayin am an idiot, i wi will not achieve anything in life and the worst that i am a mistake. i started crying and my sister came to support me. my mum tried to take my sister away and let me alone. while my sister was comforting me, my mum came into my room and started screaming at me again and saying i am a mistake. just now she came into my room and told me about consequences and that i wi will pay for everything i have done. this ti ame i talked back to her and said that i wi will achieve something in life and that i wi will be never like her when i am a dad . i threw her out of my room. i am aware that i have not been the best son ever. i almost never talk to them which makes them angry which i get. i have tried to i amprove but i feel like they never realize it and after a huge fight like this one i start from ground zero. i need help. i am lost and scared.	not depression

retiring from this sub, found the right medication dose and therapist. a little note. you ll probably hate reading this because everything feels terrible right now. you feel like you re a burden no matter the circumstance. you feel less than empty, like you suck the good out of everything. i felt this way for so many years. but there might be a therapist even via webchat that wants to help you. there might be a medication that can be your crutch. there may be a dog or cat that motivates you to go outside and buy them food. but you would not know if you stay on the couch. i am so sorry you have this i willness. please try to take the first step as i did.	not depression

years later why am i dreaming of her almost and half years later? a little back story, i had a crush on this girl i met back when we were in th grade, fast forward to my senior year of high school. i sti will like this girl years later, i finally tell her that i like her, well i tell her that i was in love with her. she did not feel the same. i was heart broken, completely devastated. any way we graduate, and i go to college and meet a few new girls who i eventually start to have a crush on, mind you i did not go back to school until a year and half later. but i started to heal and move on, i started to talk to new people and new girls got rejected by all of them but the point is i thought i moved on. it felt like i did. i did not even think of that girl from hs that i used to like, not at all. so why all this ti ame later am i now thinking about her all the ti ame? i have fr have different dreams about her in the last month and a half. and every ti ame i wake up i almost cry because who knows why, but i do not and my chest hurts from all this emotional pain over this. i even went as far as to ask her years later why she turned me down. she says she never really saw me like that and only saw me as a friend. and i said i get it and completely understood and got my closure to put it lightly. so i got my answer. so why am i sti will dreaming about her and have feelings for her ? i thought i moved on, it is been what feels like forever, a lot has happened to me , to make me a better person. i just do not know why i can not get over her. my mind wants to, my heart does not.	not depression

birthdays suck f here, been suffering with depression for almost two years now. i have noticed that over the past few years, when my birthday comes around, i feel quite down and not at all like a celebration. if it were up to me, i probably wouldn t celebrate at all, but my parents are very big on the family topic and they always want to gather for such things. i do not want to be forced to sit at a table with some family, making awkward small talk and having them take pictures of me holding the stupid cake. how do i tell my family that i would rather be alone on my birthday, because it is making me sad rather than the other way around?	not depression
help i am and my life is a mess. my dad does not care about me and he does not even understand the concept of having a career in the future. my mum keeps telling me i am not capable of anything in this world and is saying that i should just give up on school. i do not know how i can stop letting this get me down. i already feel like i have given up and people telling me i am incapable is putting me on the edge. she just told me to forget about high school. sadness is making this all worse too and i am pretty sure i have developed something called derealisation after my mum started yelling at me one day. she changes moods in an instant?? she was talking normally the other day in the car and then started screaming out of nowhere at me?? i have no motivation anymore and can not really go on	not depression

seeing a super motivated person felt like she needs help unti will it stuck me that may be i need help! i have been struggling from severe depression from almost a two years now. i have my super bad days and okay bad days and majority numb days. so, i have super motivated colleague at my research laboratory. she generally puts out lot of motivational tips and liners to stay motivated. she keeps posters of positive energy and all these posters are just two arms thistance from my table. the first ti ame i read them i felt may be she needs help, who would be so positive? and why would someone want to be so confident about themselves? for instance one of the liners says do not be afraid of the audience, if you re on the stage and they are not there is a reason behind it. and then it stuck me, is it me or her? is it me who needs help? that i can not find good in the motivational quotes or positive vibes posters? or are they really cringe worthy?	not depression
very selfish reason to visit i recently thiscovered reddit and started finding wonderful ways of getting answers with crowd sourcing. just like the internet in general, surely there are places i may want to avoid on reddit. but so far it seems fine. i also stumbled upon this place okay i was curious about a few things as to what other people think and did some search. people seem to give out honest opinions here . for very selfish reason i tend to visit here from ti ame to ti ame. you guys sharing your suffering, it makes me feel better. there is this selfish feeling to see people in a worse place that makes me feel that at least i might be in a better shape, whether or not that is true. this is a very harsh and unfair comparison, but it is almost like looking at homeless people in the street and thinking okay at least i have home with a bed. started to feel bad that i am using you people suffering for my own good. i want to apologize but please do know that you did make one person feel a little better.	not depression
when you realize just how easily replaceable you are really, people are just my friends until they find cooler friends. one day, you re best friends and do everything together. the next, they are giving every possible excuse not to go out with you but they sure have lots of ti ame to go out with other people three ti ames a week , or doing stuff together without you. and the worst thing is that i si amply can not do the same! i can not just go on and forget all the things we went through together so easily. i really get attached to people in a way that is obviously not reciprocal. the solution i found is the si amplest one just do not make any new friends. this way i can keep my self esteem at least stable. i am tired of rejection.	not depression

 year progress when i was , i was exposed to psychological bullying at school. i walked away from all my friends. after a while i got depressed. i pulled myself out of people. during this period, i became friends with my depression. for some reason i did not want to get rid of it. i felt good with it ridiculously. at , i tried to harm myself. then i realized how ridiculous it was. during this ti ame, my social anxiety started. my family was worried about me. i went to many psychologists, but i did not see any benefit. my mom refused me to use medication. i did not want it either. because everything was ending in my head. i struggled for years. i have not been out for months. when i got on the subway, my heart was pounding and i was having trouble breathing. i do not remember how many ti ames i got off from the subway and got into another one because it was crowded. i forgot how to talk to people. my hands were shaking every ti ame. after a while i got bored with this situation. people thought i was doing it to get attention. this made me feel like shit. i made some friends. they approached me first. then i approached them without noticing. i went out with them. i started talking to people but sti will my hands were shaking. i showed my real personality to people. i do not care what they think. if i got angry, i was making it clear. i just did not show when i was upset. i am years old now. i got rid of my depression. my social anxiety is over. i can now go public. i can talk to people. but i am sti will not going out alone. i believe that this wi will also pass over ti ame. all wi will pass over ti ame, friends. we wi will all have a happy life eventually.	not depression
suddenly anxious at work and it is making me hate everyone and everything. in the past, i would be all smiles and excited to go to work with all of my coworkers. we have all seemed to get a long pretty well with no problems. recently i have had some bad days with no known cause of what exactly is triggering these problems but i have a feeling it may have something to do with cliques in the workplace. it seems like recently i have been left out of most conversations now, no one really talks to me unless they absolutely need something and i am left to do whatever i can by myself. this has been going on for a few weeks now and i am sure it is making this depression worse because they use to be my escape anyti ame i would have issues. my work has gotten sloppy and i si ample do not want to wake up in the mornings anymore. i understand that i really should not care what other people think or may think about me, but i overthink everything and care pretty deeply about how people see me, unfortunately. does anyone have any recommendations as to what i can do to get away from this feeling? thank you.	not depression
and again i feel my strength vanishing i just can not anymore. the thought of going to work and doing the exact same stuff like i did for a year made me cry nonstop for an hour. i can not leave this job until next year before the corona virus it might have been an option. i have planned everything for years ahead but i feel i can barely make it until the weekend. i just want to be left alone and i feel myself losing interest in what i loved. i have to tell myself again and again that this is what i am, what makes me happy, what i am good at. normally. it is exhausting to continue being and just wish i could sleep forever. i have nobody to tell, my family says i should be so very grateful because all they have had was worse. so in turn i try to avoid them as possible. and that makes me think i have failed as a human. i have failed my own goals, my family s, in no help for my friends and i have no idea what to do instead and i am not brave enough to do something crazy. i just want to stop to exist.	not depression
i am the most insecure person i know yeah. i am very insecure, low life human being. i am very complicated and someti ames i feel like i am better off gone. those people i truly love like my close friends, i secretly not like them because they have things better than me, i truly hate myself for thinking that way. my childhood is very bad and i would like to blame my parents on how bad they are in parenting. look at what they did to me now. i am like this. i am very insecure about myself and i dont have much confidence. maybe if i grew up in a loving family, i wouldnt have such a shitty way of viewing life. it could just be that i am having this feelings bc i am in my adolescence stage but i could do better if i didnt have this feelings blocking my way.	not depression

so i feel like i have hit rock bottom i think i just want to get this off my chest. so over the weekend i had a bad episode. i had had a drink and when i past a knife in the kitchen i hurt myself before i even knew i had done it. my partner managed to patch me up and i ended up going out for a walk only to end up in a pub. one thing led to another and i managed to offend someone who decided to attack me while i was walking home. i feel ashamed and thisappointed in my self. i not only hurt myself but i put myself in a dangerous situation which i never normal would have done. hoping this wi will be the catalyst to getting the help i really need rather than thinking i can do it on my own because that clearly is not working.	not depression

do ever feel weird around people i am feel so happy when i am around people. but when i am alone that is when the self hatred come out. when i am at school i feel somewhat normal. i am mean it is better then being at home. i sti will feel it inside me but it is a thistraction for the most part. i also feel that people only like me because i am funny. nobody actually cares about me. i would ditch all my friends but if i do i wi will feel like shit. also i can be around family but i always feel like i am unwanted in the room. maybe it is because i am adopted . it is weird relationship i have with people. is this a normal thing to feel and think. i am just really stirred up being on spring break.	not depression

little rant i feel like i am close to another little break down , it is the kind where i just scream and cry, curl up and just lie on the floor for a while. i have no idea if this is common for people i am sti will new to talking about this shit o.o . anyhow, i have been depressed for as long as i remember and i was cutting myself for a long ti ame but have not in a little over years or so. but lately the urge has been a bit too much, i would not lie, it is gotten easier over the years, because i really did not want to add more scars i finally started wearing short sleeves and stuff out in public, maybe a year and a half ago .. it does not help i do not have any ganja, i live in the netherlands and the coffeeshops i sti will do not know why they call it that, i probably looked it up once but forgot have been forced to close down due to the pandemic, but ganja was working pretty well for me. some strains made my anxiety or paranoia worse, or someti ames when i would smoke too much, but at least of the ti ame it made me feel much calmer and helped me to enjoy my day at least a little, make things bearable.. i also have back pains and other random little pains that i can shrug off when i am slightly stoned i rarely get completely stoned, think i might have a high tolerance or something . so anyhow, that sucks. i quit drinking beer a few months ago because it became a problem and so now i am down to only chocolate which is soooooort of comforting but i can eat an entire bar and then just feel like i am ready to cry while also jumping all the way to the moon from the sugar rush i eat very healthy stuff most of the ti ame, so when i eat something chocolaty or sugary it is like.. woooooshhh!! . and do not get me started on the corona thing t t do not worry, i got myself started anyway, this is a weird statement why do people make this.. why am i doing it?! ... anyhow, all those damn idiots hoarding food and toilet paper, my boyfriend finally managed to find some toilet paper today and some dried red lentils which is one of our staple foods and it stresses me out so much.. and i worry one of these days we re going to be out of something and we have very little, we have been very low on money these past few months especially we have never had a lot to spare anyway and i am always craving comfort foods and stuff that i can not have and to then run out of basic things is really unpleasant also i just moved from scotland my boyfriend and i moved there initially and i was super hopeful and he got a cool job but then he quit and we quickly ran into money problems again and now we had to go back again because things weren t working out and blablabla and my friends, the only real friends i have made in years, are now all far away.. two of them are sti will in the uk one was going to india but now she could not because of virus stuff and the other is somewhere super remote in norway good for hi am though, i think and i really miss them every day and i am not on any social media, i do not have a phone, i only use email i just recently started posting here on reddit out of sheer desperation, hi... to talk to my mom i do not call my parents cus i rrrrrreeeeaaaally hate phones and especially talking on a phone so i have been extra lonely.. my boyfriend has to work a lot, especially now because co workers are getting sick and taking extra measures not to infect people.. because he works with sick kids and nobody can risk infecting them which is another worry of mine! i am so scared he is going to catch the virus from some random person in the supermarket or something and then spread it to the kids without knowing it and they could die from it and i honestly do not know if i could live with that.. on the bright side, he would not get it from me.. i have not left the house in weeks, months ? i do not even know.. i went outside with hi am, a few weeks ago, to go to the stores.. and i think we went for a walk in the woods once.. today i stood out in the garden for a few minutes.. but someti ames i get so nervous or scared or both for no good reason that i do not even like being near the windows where people could possibly see me. i am turning next month... i thought my last birthday was somewhat of a miracle because i used to say i wouldn t make it past .. but also.. we arrived in scotland on my birthday i even had cake, yay! and i was so hopeful and opti amistic about everything.. before we left i made some good changes, i was eating well, lifting weights, i was growing my hair and my beard yeah, i am a boy, lemme know if i surprised you, cus that might make me smile both of which were very bushy and full and then i got sick, a week maybe two at most after we arrived and was stuck in bed for a whole week or something and it was awful and i fell back into my old habits soon after that. it all went downhi will from there. i shaved my beard because it became very annoying while i was sick and struggled to eat, later that year i also cut my long hair after my boyfriend is mother commented on my grey hairs why do people insist on pointing that out?! and while i used the excuse of i wanted to try short hair and told everyone that i would have regretted not cutting it also which is partly true .. i miss my long hair so much.. it was almost at the longest length i have had before and i really wanted to go beyond that.. another random annoying thing my twitchy eye has returned, it started a few years ago and came and went, but it is back now and it really bugs me.. always my right eye, feels like it is the lower right corner but i am not entirely sure have not really bothered looking in the mirror, cus i do not like looking in the mirror half the ti ame ofc .. anyhow, i got to eat dinner now and this is probably not a little rant and i might delete it or whatever later if that is possible.. but i expect it to be buried below the other posts and that is fine with me.. honestly, even if people comment hi again , what exactly is that going to do for me? i am too much of a hermit, maybe i wi will leave it on as a form of exposure therapy.	not depression

i just lost my job i live in washington state. i am a server and our governor close all restaurants and bars due to the coronavirus. i was already feeling so defeated. every ti ame i get back up something pushes me down. we had just caught up on our bi wills and were starting to make money when business started to slow. then my workplace put out a deal that brought in customers and the tip was based off of the original total so i was really excited. we actually got kind of busy. then the governor closed the restaurants and bars. i know this is for the safety and well being of everyone around me. but i am so scared now that i am not going to be able to pay my bi wills. i have to apply for unemployment and try and find another job when no where is going to hire me because of this stupid virus. why is this happening? i do not know what else to do. i feel so defeated. i hope somehow my apartments waive rent for this month. maybe i wi will at least be able to land another job by ti ame the next months rent is due. i could really use kind words and idea on how to maybe get a job when ti ames are so hard. i just do not see the light at the end of this tunnel.	not depression

stress has been acting up. i almost could not get any sleep last night. more stress means me going to pee at night even when it is not necessary if i feel the slightest bit of pressure. i even felt a bit uncomfortable. earlier today i felt tired, apathetic and worthless, i almost could not get up from my pc to clean up my space and shower up. although showering has helped me feel slightly better, dehydration was not helping, so i may as well drink plenty of fluids or i may get another mental breakdown. having a mental breakdown gives me what i call a invisible headache .	not depression

feeling stuck, trapped and alone during the last years, i have worked about . i have had to come back from a hanging attempt, hospitalisation and the realisation my family did not care. so i ditched them i got back into my career and things seemed possible for a while, then i was evicted due landlord selling up, unexpectedly dragged into my father is death by my extended family and fired by email from a hostile new job, when i was off sick with stress. that knocked me over again and pretty much ki willed off any remaining trust in people. even my cousin is uncaring, very well paid job, fancy audi and i never hear from her. after a few more years of therapy, i was offered jobs again, i chose one that required relocating. lodged with someone for a few months who was super controlling and i have ended up in a run down houseshare i am contracted in until july. i do not sleep well the new job sucks, i am surrounded by selfish, dysfunctional people working for a government agency. the whole things been a waste of ti ame and my mental health is worse now than when i was on sickness benefits. i was looking forward to a fresh start and it is been such a huge thisappointment. i am and after pulling myself back from the dead years ago, the last few years have just robbed me of everything. i have literally got one friend left on this entire planet and they live in berlin. over years of therapy and part qualified in counseling and all i can honestly say after all my efforts in life is that most people are so fucked up they do not even know how fucked up they are. so they go around fucking everyone else up in their arrogant ignorance. i have no reason to trust people anymore, i doubt i have ever met many people who were worthy of trust and i feel they are in the minority.	not depression

just some rambling. this is my first ti ame posting on here, or reaching out in general. i do not know if this is the exact correct subreddit, but here it goes. i have had trouble with feelings of depression since i was in middle school, but have generally been able to function. i would slip on a mask of the guy everyone expected and just force myself through the motions. i have gotten pretty good at faking most emotional responses, appearing happy and engaged when i was absolutely thispassionate about situations that i should enjoy like being out with friends or going to concerts. this was not a fix for my mental state, and i knew that it was just bottling it up, but the few ti ames i tried to talk either to parents or teachers about it i was told to just deal with it, man up, or some other shitty line. i am in my mid s now, and i have just been having a harder and harder ti ame keeping going. i have started to have some suicidal inclinations, enough so that i left my gun at my father is house. i am enjoying my hobbies less and less, and even spending ti ame with my girlfriend has become difficult. i do not really know what i am looking for, or how i expect this to help me in any way. i just felt like maybe saying this stuff in some form, even on the internet, might help me keep from feeling so damn bottled up and empty. to anyone that read this, thank you.	not depression

give me a reason to live man what are some actually good reasons to live. i used to think that having genuine relationships with people and my parents would make me want to live. but those people have gotten tired of me, have called me selfish for being depressed and trying to isolate myself, and have left and judged me. i thought my parents loved me, but they now tell me to stop bothering them and just commit suicide quietly. they tell me they are tired of my shit and to stop being a parasite. i do not have any close friends anymore so that is out the window. no one really cared about me in the first place anyway. none of the hobbies i used to enjoy make me happy anymore. i used to like playing tennis, but after not playing for a long ti ame, i suck lol. in the middle of a tennis game, i actually had a mental breakdown and started crying because it was so boring. i used to like reading too but now it bores my mind and i can not concentrate for more than minutes. now, i just spend my days watching youtube and watching movies and sleeping most of the day so that ti ame wi will pass. i used to go to church and i would feel somewhat okay but one church member verbally abused me and so i stopped going because i was hurt from their words. i think food is the only thing that makes me happy so i usually stuff my face with it. even though, i know i am full and it hurts to eat more, i usually just shove more food in my mouth so i can feel the chemicals entering my brain to make me feel good. i tell myself i am living for the future because i want to go to pa school but i doubt that i wi will ever be able to go back to normal again enough to study and get through the stress of school without dropping out. i think about ki willing myself everyday now but i want to make sure that i properly die and without being left thisabled or permanently damaged. there is no painless way of dying it seems. i am too scared to check myself into the hospital again because the last ti ame was traumatic and i am afraid i wi will get coronavirus. i heard there was a patient with it in the hospital and they died. someone please give me a reason to live.	not depression

so lost and confused with myself. never usually reach out for help, but i have gotten to a point in my life i am just so lost..... in the years of life that i have lived, i have been through hell after hell. now, dont get me wrong, there are probably mi willions of people that have it worse off than i do. its just that after constantly being crushed down, manipulated, abused, and more recently having your only kid taken away for no reason. i have had depression for the majority of my life. being put on drugs as a kid, beaten when out of line, bullied in every single school i went to and there were quite a few because my parents moved around alot growing up so never really had a set school. never had my first relationship ti will which lasted for a year and a half. she broke up with me after beating me in a hotel room, and when i went to cops with pics, texts, evidence out the arse, etc., they too laughed at me because i am a man. nd relationship i was cheated on for the entirety of the months with her best friend . the last one i had was just over a year. lived together before we started dating, ended up feeling she was the one and proposed never really liked marriage but for her i wanted it she then got pregnant with my only child and has, since nd month of pregnancy, made my life miserable and broke me in ways i can not even explain really, really long story of manipulation, heart break, and trauma . including all of my family life, personal life, relationship life, i have never been the one for revenge, or wishing death upon anyone. ive always been the give you the shirt off my back kind of person, even if i dont know you. i always treated everyone family, friends, lovers, strangers with my utmost respect and always did everything i could in between to have a good life and be happy but its gotten to a point now where everything around me has crumbled down and i have a pain and emptiness inside of me i have never had before. i honestly feel so lost and feel my life is slipping away and nothing i do or try to do is pulling it back. if you read this novel of a life story i wrote, i really do appreciate it, and any advice or tips i can get to shine some light on this never ending darkness would be very helpful. again, thank you so much for taking the ti ame, i know it was alot lt 	not depression

i do not need a long post to get help, i would just like it before i decided to post in this subreddit i thought it would be best to type out my post in notes, you know to make it nice, but halfway through my eloquently worded post i thought why the fuck am i doing this? it is crude but it was what i really thought. so here is my plight in the si amplest terms. i am nearing my th birthday and under a strange string of random circumstances i came to meeting up with a girl for coffee since she was having relationship issues. now this girl is absolutely funny, cute and laughs at my jokes. what is stupid about this is that we both used to have crushes on each other in year that is th grade for americans and others . back then i crushed on her so hard and we seemed to vibe really well but it seems that i did not quite pick up on that with my i ammaturity and eventually ti ame faded our relationship. jumping forward a couple years and my crush seemed to persist, bubbling inside me and growing without my knowledge. jumping back to the present. we met up and had some coffee and i quickly became her confidant for that evening, talking to her about everything and anything that worried her. she had a history of depression and an eating thisorder which contributed to her having low self esteem and looking at others thinking that they are so much better than her. she self harmed, cried and seemed to starve herself through the past couple of years. her close friend group seems to have grown used to her mental health issues and now they do not seem to care for her, treating it like normal for her to be sad. anyway after the evening the crush that had been bubbling slowly started to be released, despite the years difference we sti will got on really well with each other and i can sti will manage to get her to laugh and thisplay her pearly smile. jump forward a couple days and she decided to break up with her current boyfriend, one week later i ask if she wants to meet up again and she says yes. this ti ame it was more than just friendly talk and advice giving. we hung out, we talked, we laughed and we watched my neighbour totoro for the first ti ame whilst she laid in my arms. and i realised that i want nothing more than to see her leaning against my chest with a smile on her face. with that the crush bubble burst and what seemed like years worth of feelings rushed out. i felt euphoric. a day later i sent her a message to ask what she found of the film but she did not reply. i waited a day. she did not reply. the next day i sent her a message asking if she wanted to meet up and talk. sti will no reply so i started getting worried for her. but then i started getting worried that me messaging too much cause her to think i am being clingy which then led to a spiral of thoughts. anyway i finally shoot her a message on twitter just asking are you okay? to which she replied yeah, just mental health and things . i am not asking for reddit gold or mi willions of karma or validation. all i want to ask is how i should navigate this, so that i can get back to seeing her smile.	not depression

downvote me if you want but this is what i think this subreddit is useless the only ti ame people talk to you is when you say in your title i have nobody to talk to or nobody wi will talk to me but when you have a normal post the comments are empty. i was okay with nobody saying anything at first and just recording my thoughts but now it feels useless my sadness and the cold around me would not go now it is just stuck in my head so this wi will be my last post on this subreddit for some ti ame until things get serious and i really need to say something in the future look at posts with comments because they have no help and nobody else do not just try and help the easy ones. when you do help do not just say you should speak to a therapist or speak to someone they are posting here because they can not and because they do not trust anyone. finally do not go for the easy ones just because they are easy i know you must be busy but if you really want to help go to the first person you see do not filter people out.thanks to the few people that have commented on my posts.	not depression
what to say when your loved one says he is tired? i posted this in r ptsd but i thought that maybe this sub may help me too. i have been going out with this amazing, incredible man for about year. he is a marines and suffers from mild ptsd. someti ames, i feel helpless in finding the right words to say to hi am, to make hi am feel like he is not alone, to make hi am feel like it is okay to be tired. he is a man who takes seriously his responsibilities and feels guilty to not be able to meet the expectations of others but above all, his own expectations towards hi amself. frustrated at being like how he is, trying to overcome but unable to, trying to begin anew but failing each ti ame. what can i say to hi am when he shares his heart with me and tells me he is tired? tired of fighting. tired of trying so hard. just tired, not just physically but in general. someti ames not often wondering by hi amself why he did not die in his sleep. please tell me how i can help hi am, what can i say to hi am, what can i do for hi am. i love hi am with all my heart and it hurts me to see i can not do much. someti ames he feels like he does not deserve me, that he brings me down, that i would be better off without hi am so i would be able to meet someone without all his baggage like he always says. how can i show hi am my support? what would you have wished someone told you or do for you?	not depression
i am definitely going to ki will myself. i just got laid off indefinitely. this comes weeks after my girlfriend cheated on and left me, and years after an arrest i have been trying to get expunged ever since. i did what i was arrested for, went to court, and did hours of community service as well as pay back everything i owed so that i could get a deferred prosecution but that is yet to have gone through up to modern day now, i just got laid off indefinitely from the movie theater i work at because of the coronavirus and i would not be able to get another job because of my record. i am at the point where i have absolutely nothing going for me save for the months ahead where i get to waste away alone with nothing but my thoughts and that is assuming i even have a place to live . that is not something i want to do. knowing me and given that this is far from the first ti ame i have attempted to end my own life i wi will probably just chicken out and not be able to go through with it for whatever reason ranging from the pain to knowing what it would do to the people i care about but fuck do i not want to live for any longer. please, please let this be the one ti ame i actually go through with it.	not depression

death, a family feud, and now a virus about three weeks ago, my grandma passed away at the age of . it was not unexpected, but it is sti will never fun when someone in your life passes. she had a good amount of wealth, which she left to my mom, her main caregiver, and her grandkids. she had three other living children who she left nothing to. we knew when she was gone that things would start to get messy, and they have, all because of the money and those who were not named beneficiaries of it. it has been extremely stressful during this ti ame on me, someone who has dealt with anxiety and depressive periods since my teens. some of the things that have helped me deal with those ti ames is travel and sports. two things i can i ammerse myself in and get away from it all. now, because of this virus, both of those things are not really an option for me. i feel like i am suffocating, basically having no answer as to when i can do those things again, and wondering what is the point. because it is really hard for me to find one right now. my exhausted mind and body are not sure how much more they can give without some relief.	not depression

bipolar thisorder does not make sense to me, other personal thoughts experiences i have, etc for example, how is one supposed to differentiate episodes of mania hypomania states from depressive states as a thistinct problem vs having highs and lows caused by other things such as ritualistic coping mechanisms that influence personality? like if the way someone functions is relatively stable, hence in relation to having a personality thisorder , then how is one supposed to make a qualitative thistinction between how someone with bipolar thisorder should behave like think like function like who does not have a personality thisorder vs someone who does not have bipolar thisorder but does have a personality vs someone who has both let us just say . as someone who is not diagnosed with bipolar thisorder of any type instead have schizotypal personality thisorder and major depression , but whom has met and been around many people who have had it for many years, probably the majority of them being the case in mental health groups, what i never seem to understand is this whole state dependent thing. like you either randomly become manic hypomanic or you become depressed . it is as if environmental issues other factors do not play a significan not role or do not need to at all, and it is si amply a come and go thing that is percent biological. it is often very evident in the way they talk, like when i am in a depressive state , it is difficult to do things, and if i am in a manic state, we ll i am doing things in stereotypical manners... and a lot of people could say, we ll, it is like the whole spectrum way of looking at things, and that it only becomes a thisorder if there is enough symptoms or i ampairment to start being considered one, but that is a problem, because it does not look at why the person is the way they are and it is assuming that what the person is expressing or functioning like is the same thing as another. often when i would go to the dbsa groups, they would use a scale, and eventually i became tired of giving a number, because neither numbers would fit my types of problems. if i said i was a low enough number, it would suggest that i should be in the hospital i had to clarify a more specific number to indicate what would be more realistic when really the bipolar scale just was not applicable to me , and if i suggested something in the high range, it would suggest that i am manic or have some form of mania, when it is not. so much an issue, that i would be concerned about other people suggesting me to go take of my mental health first, because they are too dumb to realize anything more complex. for example, agitation anxiety irritability or restlesness would be considered as leaning towards mania, yet when you look at many research, it shows that those with unipolar depression can have all these issues, but that does not make them have any sort of bipolar thisorder...., you know, agitated depression would be an example. now this is just my personal observation opinion, but i feel like bipolar thisorder is a combination of biological and personality caused condition, where it can only occur in certain people with certain personality psychological traits and biological influences. the reason why i say this is because pretty much everyone i would meet or seen, as well as what research has shown about these individuals, as well as observing the nature of the condition itself, has shown that the type of problem in bipolar thisorder is more specific to certain types of people with certain types of genes. and so what i am trying to say is that it wouldn t be correct or logical to just say that everyone can develop thisorder, regardless of personality and genetic associations, and neither would it make sense for many other thisorders. and so it is really irritating when people just wan t to generalize or give a statement such as we ll, just because your experience was like that, does not mean it can not be like this. like they are not actually factoring in what i said and coming up with an explanation that could provide some kind of reasoning that would answer my question in a more careful conscientious manner. like you could say, hmm..., that is a good point, i am not sure, i guess it could be like this or that..., but the thing is, from all these bipolar people i met and talked to, both in person and online, it was not like that at all, and that was with most of them being medicated too...., and i never found someone who was different than the big research either or mbti faceats in relation to bipolar related thisorders, including schizoaffective thisorder bipolar type. all of them were either n is ps and or low on conscientiousness high openness to experience, either low or high on agreeableness, low or high on extroversion, high on neuroticism . also as a random inference, what i noticed is that borderline pd co occurred in a large proportion of these bipolar thisordered people, and i did not find that surprising because the same has been shown in other research , and many of these people, if not majority of them i should say benefit well from the same types of treatments of typical people. like if they were qualitatively differently functioning people that much, they wouldn t be benefiting so well or have such good outcome, particularly in the same domains of typical people, yet they do and my experiences with them were more or less si amilar. their personalities although not all the same were more alike than different. i use to think i had borderline pd before i was diagnosed with schizotypal pd, until i realized i am not like those who actually are diagnosed with borderline pd at all, and i do not even wan t to associate myself with them either. but then again, i do not relate to the majority of people with schizotypal pd either, so much that i do not think i even have schizotypal pd. it seems like the only logical solution would be personality thisorder nos, but who is going to get support for that? i have tried raising si amilar questions and viewpoints in various threads, reddit, psychforums, mentalhealthforums, and other places, but i just do not have anyone else who shares the same experiences as me or thinks functions the same way, and even if they do, we ll they unfortunately suffer more silently and are not as visibly thiscernible, but i know that wouldn t be true, because if they really were like me, i would bump into more of them making the same types of points. you know, i rarely give casual generalized responses. my hope is to find a personality thisorder support group in person that is not focused on borderline pd, since the only ones out there largely focus on those who have borderline pd, which again, i see them closer to those with bipolar thisorder than those with actual personality thisorders...., but i guess my definition is a bit broad. i wi will say that i never met someone who had vulnerable narcissism or paranoid pd. i mean, tons of people with paranoid schizophrenia but thisorders that had paranoia in terms of relating to their personality, nada...., and even if i did, they weren t like me, and their paranoia was more or less the same type found in schizophrenia.	not depression
i just want someone to acknowledge it i just want someone, anyone, teacher, friend, sibling, parent, to wrap their arms around my and say it is okay that you feel like this. it is okay to be in therapy. it is okay to let your room get dirty. it is okay to stay in bed. it is okay that you can not eat. it is okay your scars are visible. it is okay that you re not perfect. you re allowed to be in pain. now let us figure out why you feel this way because, no, you are not a monster. no, you do not need perfect grades. no, you are not a horrible daughter. no, you did not deserve assault. no, you are not a monster for stopping hi am. no, you are not manipulating people into thinking they enjoy your presence, they just enjoy your presence. damn that is a big chunk. idk i just wish there were one person in my life irl not on reddit who could just really see me. who could just see that i am drowning and tell me that they know i am drowning. i do not even need them to be the one to save me i just need them to understand me. i really hate posting on reddit because everyone in my head is yelling at me that my grammar is wrong or i am not getting the point across or i am a stupid brat for even asking for help. and i am not even asking for help its just nice seeing people voice things that i also feel so maybe this wi will make someone who feels the same way as i do about this a little more comfortable. idk i have a feeling i wi will end up deleting this	not depression

this is going to be long so please bear with me cause no one else would i was a bright child while growing, naughtier than most but also serious about my studies. but things started to change as i grew we had no counselling so i became direction less and confused adding to the mix was my family thiscouraging anything i found interesting so i became a rebel. lost interest in studies ti will high school but got a little serious during college and realized it was not for me. sti will everyone thiscouraged me to switch college degree. i am missing on many details but only putting in i amportant information. later many other decisions were forced on me and had to accept silently. i found a really good job thanks to the hiring manager who trusted me although i had social anxiety and a slight awkwardness that i had developed over the years. in a matter of months i was promoted and got good growth and loved the work. i love my family, i could have moved out and afford to live on my own but i choose to stay even though i was sti will thiscouraged from the job. as it was a start up and they wanted a stable, high paying job. having so much recognition at workplace but no respect at home brought me back to older days. i came back home tired mostly overstayed at office so i wouldn t have to listen to my family but sti will keep listening to how ridiculous my job or voices were. how i could achieve and do more with my ti ame. so i quit to follow their advice. but sti will they were not happy. now i have switched several counselors, medicines and i am around . i have lost several kilos of weight on my body, i have lost my social ski wills, i can not agree with people, i like arguing when i am comfortable with people. i am very humble but i can not express myself anymore. i do not does not to friends. i do not speak to family and now i have gone completely silent. i can not speak or feel like it. so one day it wi will all end and they wi will sti will curse me for not thinking about them.	not depression

just thought i share my story, hopefully it can help at least one person on here well hello. let me d ox introduce myself. my name is jaden becker, and i have been dealing with depression for about years of my life, and just thought i would share my story to share what worked for me and what did not. let us begin lol i wi will make a list of things that i did throughout my recovery at the bottom if you do not want to read my life story lol. my first real encounters of depression started in th grade. school up until this point was relatively enjoyable for me and i did not mind going and doing the work... but towards the end of the first semester of th grade i just started to not care as much, i would do anything to just stay at home stay in bed and let ti ame pass away. i was slowly losing motivation to anything related to school, thankfully this started more towards then end but i barely actually passed all the classes i needed to continue to high school. th grade ah yes where to start. first day i was going to a public high school that almost zero of my elementary middle school friends were going to, but first weeks basically was doing next to nothing at this point it might of been a bit of depression and that i just did not care about school at all, but about weeks or something in i switched to a early college school that some of my middle school friends went to. it was ok but sti will just was not doing anything i just did not care. that school dint work either and my parents at this ti ame had found out about all the darker sides of my life drugs, vaping, etc and pulled me out into online school. well well what a surprise i did not do shit on that either and i ended up finishing my th grade year with only a fucking p.e credit... th grade now th grader by credits though but i am now back at the first public high school i started at. over the summer i sorta got my life together and was actually going to try my hardest as i realized that i actually need my diploma. first semester was ok at best it was a lot of s and barely passing but we managed . this is were i say my depression really started the second semester of th grade from th th i felt it was just slowly getting worst and worst now it was getting noticeably bad and was not just me not giving a fuck anymore although at the ti ame i sti will just thought it was me and that i was just a stupid lazy shit who was not gong anywhere second semester i somehow managed to convince my parents to allow me to go back to online school because i would do amazing in it and totally get amazing grades! in reality i just did not have the energy to get myself up anymore and i did not see the point life was a fucking waste of ti ame and nothing made me happy. nothing made me feel anything. at this point i just felt an empty shell yeah my body might of been alive but mentally it was just a void no feeling no energy no motivation, i just wanted to lay in bed the rest of my life as nothing had a point. back to th grade online school did not work and i ended up not getting a single credit second semester. summer i had started up bmx racing i was doing freestyle bmx since th grade and was pretty ok at it but i ended up being really good. i was winning every novice race by like a whole straights, i went to a racing camp with one of my friends and had many lovely people who i can not thank enough help refine my gate starts etc to refine my talent into actual ski will. i was told by many pro is that they expect to see me in nationals and i promised them i would... fast forward a bit i had won gold cup without breaking a sweat and was invited to join a team, my current race bike was way to small but it was all i could afford at , but the team promised me a free . in i think this was a bit ago dollar frame to join there team, so how could i say no? fast forward even a bit more and i had now won all of my races to be a inter racer and get clips only placing rd in one race a yr expert race as a yr novice lol. after this for just some reason my motivation for things that brought me joy and pleasure started becoming a chore more than a release. it was a struggle for me to play fucking video games, but depression had not crossed my mind one ti ame, i just thought i was outgrowing these things so after becoming a inter but not getting to race even once as one i quit my team, and i sold my race bike throwing away all my training, hard work dedication away as i just was not motivated to do it anymore. i quit racing around august and school started up again now starting up at the same public high school for the third ti ame i thought this year would be different i told myself i was going to do this that i could do this i needed to do good this year i could not fail. two weeks in to school and i was doing ok but now from the very little energy and motivation i had left at this point it was all gone. i completely stopped going and my parents with drawled me to not get into legal trouble. i think some of you might be at this point right now, at this point i truly felt nothing, no energy, no sadness, no happiness, no anger, no motivation, nothing. i was not living i was just moving day by day waiting for my death to finally leave this hell of nothing and emptiness. my parents put me into a free program for mental health, i thought it was fucking stupid i thought i was fine i was just a failure i was choosing to do this all this was not fucking depression. well we had intake and my first meeting was i ammediately diagnosed with chronic depressive thisorder just the fancy medical term for it . i do not remember a lot from this ti ame frame i just remember going in week after week waiting to try to get medicine to see if it would help as i was lost i did not know what to do anymore and i was fucking tired of being an empty shell with no emotions or feeling... i am glad i got help at the ti ame that i did because at this point my depression was at its fucking worse, i was tired of being empty i just wanted to feel fucking something, so about weeks into the program without going into much detail one night i cut myself, bad. it was not so much that i wanted to die, its just that for once in my life i felt.. something, but i was going to end up ki willing myself if i continued down this path, i am almost positive that if i had not got help at the ti ame i did i wouldn t be typing this right now... some reason i made myself tell my parents i did so they took away all the knives all the drugs etc so i could not harm myself well besides the one i had hid i did not want to give up the razor cause at the ti ame it felt like that was the only thing that could help it was the only solution to my problem... my counselor somehow managed to convince me to give it up and so i did although not happy about it at the ti ame. weeks pass and i finally get to see the psychiatrist, long story short was prescribed mg of bupropion wellbutrin it took a bit to get into my system and i know they say that medicine is not magic and i agree it is not a lot of it is in you but holy shit i finally after the long years started to feel something i did not care what it was, i sti will did not have a lot of energy but i was starting to find joy in things i used to like video games etc. i wi will just summarize the next months as it was mostly just counselling talking and finding the right dosage which finally i am at mg bupropion but in january i started at a credit recovery high school and have been doing the best i have ever done in school. ever. i have made more credits in this semester than i did in the previous two years combined... to finish this up i can not say i know where you are, and i do not understand exactly how you feel, but just know i have been through my shit, and i know it all may seem lost and that life has no point and why even try but just trust me, it is a lot of hard work but it is worth it, just do not give up, do not ever give up. if you feel like you can not do it anymore please contact a hotline or just someone anyone do not let your own thoughts get to you... so now here is what helped me get better not saying this wi will work for you but trying wi will not hurt find something anything that you want to accomplish and hold on to that with your fucking life. for me this was graduating high school and becoming a game developer. i sti will have not accomplished these but these goals really gave me something to be getting better for and to look forward to, you need to find something that you want to do and do not you dare fucking tell me there is nothing, find literally anything you have any slightest interest in accomplishing. have something for when you re in your darkest ti ames that you can repeat in your head and carry with you wherever you go to remind you that no matter where you are right now you can and this wi will get better you just can not give up. this was the biggest thing for me. this story is kind of corny but me and my friend were up at am playing no mans sky and i had just finished the story. i was on a space station and one of the npcs said to me life is beautiful if you let it be. life is not a question. there does not need to be an answer. i literally just started balling. for the first ti ame in years i was crying, i was feeling, this one quote from a fucking game opened my eyes and made me realize that life does not need a purpose, i just need to enjoy what i have while i have it. we do not need a purpose, just enjoy life and make the most of it. i had wasted so much of my life trying to figure out why i was here when i just needed to enjoy what i was gifted with and not worry about the whats and whys... the other main one i carried with me in my heart was from a ani ame lol black clover, do not remember the episode exactly but the eye of whatever is invading the royal capital to steal the cri amson lions captains amulet which is a magic stone the cri amson lions captain says to noelle being weak is nothing to be ashamed of, but remaining weak is! this, this is what carried me all the way. anyti ame i felt like i could not do anything and that all was lost i replayed this in my head accepted that yes at this ti ame i am weak, but now what am i going to do to help take steps to fix it, and at that ti ame you might not have the answer but as long as you are giving any effort to get better at all than you have nothing to be ashamed of. the final thing is hard to do but you have to want to be get better, and you have to put in the work this is not going to be easy, it was one of the hardest things i have ever done. now i am not saying that depression is all in your head and that if you have enough wi will power you can break free. i am sorry that is sadly not how depression works, but you sti will have to want to be better. if you personally in your heart have no desire to change then change wi will never happen. only you can take that first step to finding help to get better and find create a support system so you can truly get better and fucking curb stomp depression you can beat this, and do not you dare say you can not and that no cares or believes in you, it does not matter who you are or where you are at, i care and i believe in you and i know you can do this! a last comment i wi will make is do not listen to people. the world has no fucking clue what depression actually is and they wi will act like they do. if people judge you or think you are weak because of the mental i willness you have they are no better than depression itself. i wish no person to ever have depression as it has been one of the worst experiences of my life, but i wish they could just be in our bodies for one day and see how they feel and then show me how they are going to wi will power through it. if you have cuts or scars on your arms legs etc whatever do not be afraid to show them, i am not going to say i am proud of my scars but i am not ashamed. it is something i went through and i would not change it, although it was a horrible situation it made me who i am and i am proud of who i am right now. i am not going to cover them up to make you feel better. deal with it, i live with it everyday you can deal with having to be around me for the mins. it is not my job to preserve your poor innocent eyes and i am not going to make some bullshit excuse of what they are to make you more comfortable, although people have no place in asking about that shit. if you want to judge me because of my scars keep it to yourself and do not talk to me thanks. sorry if this post is a mess lol i just have never really written out everything and i am not too good at writing coherent thoughts so i wi will try to clear things up if y all have questions or whatever	not depression
i do not even know if this has to do with deppresion my one friend invited me to talk with some of his friends not to long ago, we kind of became friends me and them, somehow when we hang out i always feel like i am stupid, like my problems do not matter. it is like i am all alone even though i am with other people, i just feel laughed at, like i am just there for their entertainment, i would compare the feeling to trying your hardest at something and then having it torn up and people laughing at you for thinking you had done something worthy of even looking at. does anybody else feel this way?	not depression
i am exhausted of being alone i just want to feel loved, appreciated and to have someone there for me. to say they care and to show it. be there for me without me asking them to be. showing up even when they do not have to. make me laugh when i am upset or just sit in silence, keeping me company. i miss having someone around me. instead, i feel unloved, uni amportant, and worthless. i feel like i am fading. i have been so darn lonely for the past couple years. i can not help but feel like there is something wrong with me. to have affection or just the reassurance that there is someone there. i wish i had that. but i do not. and i do not know when i wi will or if i ever wi will. i do know that i am exhausted of trying and coming up empty handed. i am losing my strength to try. only because i have been trying for so long. if i could just thisappear i would. but it is not that si ample...	not depression
if this were a game, i would have hit restart. ever feel like you screwed the build on this game life? like the build is all wrong, and if you could, you d hit restart and go back to the beginning. it is not that i am hopeless. i have all my li ambs. i am reasonably adult in taking care of things. it is just that everyone is so much better at everything. people manage to learn other languages. i have been studying my wife is native tongue for years now. sti will can not do more than pick out the occasional word. people play musical instruments. i got told that maybe i have talents in other fields. people manage to find jobs after a few applications. i am on month of unemployment.	not depression
just wanting to talk hello. i am really scared. i am going to go to juvenile intake in a month and i am scared on what is going to happen. the reason why i am going is because i skipped school a lot of ti ames. i know i should have been more responsible but i can not stand it there everyone thinks i look like a creep, i have been ostracized at that school, i have been ignored when i was hurting myself! i feel like if i ki willed myself that is the only way they would show compassion but i think that is a stretch. currently withdrawn from school so that is nice do not have to deal with them. i am unsure what to do or what is going to happen. my mom is not reassuring me either or even helping me for that matter. i am just alone would be lying if i did not thinking of ending my life. i have spoken about these topics before just privately though.	not depression
how is everyone doing? i read this subreddit every day and i just wanted to check in anyone have anything they want to talk about?	not depression
i thisgust myself i honestly just want to be gone, i feel like all i do is inconvenience others and fuck up which i ampacts the people i already inconvenience. i just want to thisappear. i wish that i never existed because then no one would have ever had to deal with me and i wouldn t hurt those around me unlike if i died. i just want this to all be over right now, i want to just thisintegrate. sorry to bother, i just needed to get this off of my chest because i know i can not tell those around me without hurting them or making them have to feel even more responsible.	not depression

i wish i could forget crappy memories you make a mistake, any mistake, someti ames it only takes a second, and it is with you for the rest of your life! the memories come and go, but they never leave for good. it sucks so bad. i was having a decent evening, then bam, my brain is suddenly inundated with a crappy memory of a stupid mistake i made years ago! some of them i made years ago. i wish i could do things over or remove these memories.	not depression
 you re useless , you should be more like them , your face has a lot of flaws . words my mother says to me. legit do not know why i made it this far. father has sided with me most of the ti ame. hope that i get the education that i need and move out, then show my mother how great i am without her. sad part is, school is about to be shut down due to corona. 	not depression
i never realized how boring my life is without school until now my school got shit down, like most people and i have literally spent the whole day thinking about random shit and never knew how much of a no life i am until today so now i get to cry and stuff until i fall asleep	not depression
uselessness i can not think quickly, efficiently, or even coherently enough to justify my existence. the resources i consume could, and should, be better allocated to more useful people. it literally took me two minutes just to form and type out those two sentences. fuck. i do not understand what people ever saw in me to think i was smart.	not depression
upset with the way i look i think i am starting to look ugly, i do not want to be rude but i am starting to look more like my dad who is not that great looking either i am going to regret saying this , he is not ugly but he is not my type. i hate my facial structure and each year that goes by i am starting to look like hi am. in mirrors i look fine but in pictures i look weird, i wish i just had an average face.	not depression

my gf found her nudes on her stepdad phone to begin i am years old my girlfriend is also . recently she got her phone taken away by her parents for about weeks during that ti ame i gave her one of my old phones so we could sti will communicate using snapchat. we have exchanged nudes in the past but not frequently. we both have each other nudes saved on our snapchat conversation. while her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. after she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it. about days after the argument where her phone was broken she got a new one and proceeded in life normally. it is been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that ti ame she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call hi am most of the ti ame if she needed to speak to hi am. today he asked her to text hi am what she wanted to eat and she realized when she scrolled up that nudes from her old phone had been sent to her stepdad while it should have been in the safe. we checked the dates that it was sent and that was during the ti ame when the phone was not in her position. there was nude pictures and videos that would normally require a password to access. i should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone i gave her during the ti ame her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a ti ame. she later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the ti ame including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. during the ti ame her phone was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and could not log back in for a period of ti ame and the ti ame and date match to when the nudes were sent. her mom does not know and is away for the next days in a foreign country. she is currently there alone with her stepdad. what should she do?	not depression
homeless, but not shelterless everyone says being homeless is terrible. i have learned that every situation is different. i am homeless, but not because i made poor financial decisions, or choose drugs and lost everything, or lost my job. i am homeless due to escaping an abusive and toxic environment. i sleep in my car and live out of a storage unit. at first, it was terrible. i was thiscouraged, scared, angry, all the emotions poured through my body. my first night in my car i ended up in the hospital with an extreme panic attack. as ti ame has gone on, i have learned how to adjust, what places are homeless friendly and what ones are not. i see homelessness with new eyes. i sti will wish that it was not something that is looked so down on and that homeless people were not seen as in the way something that takes up space in society. many homeless people have no shelter and live on the streets. many have mental i willnesses and can not afford medication to help them, so to others, they seem dirty and crazed. i am lucky to have my car for my shelter. i have a support system of friends that i met at work that have quickly become family. i have my church family and a few individuals that i met when i first moved here. things could always be worse. but in a sense, i feel very free. it is sti will hard, but i feel safer in most ways now than i did when i was in the environment i escaped from. i guess my point is this please be kind to everyone, you do not know what they are going through. they may be smiling on the outside, but broken on the inside. trying to do the best they can, but sti will struggling. we are sti will people, just down on our luck. 	not depression
am i overreacting? i always been made fun of my weight. i have been told to ki will myself someti ames by toxic friends and the most frustrating part is they treat it like a joke. i am not good at a lot of things i try to i amprove but i can never keep up. my parents are divorced. i always feel like as if i am doing something wrong and feel worthless i try to evaluate but i can not figure it out. i get harassed and hit in the back of my head almost everyday at school. i want to fight back but i rather not get into that. i want to tell but i would be a snitch and no one likes that. i feel sad and thisappointed in myself. i do not show my tears but i cry internally. worst thing of all is that the school that i go to is catholic and i always think how can people act in such a way that it goes completely against the teachings of god and question myself always. i always think people hate me and are only talking to me to be nice but i am just a burden to talk to.	not depression

is being homeless worth it i am currently in college rn and am fortunate to have my parents pay for it, but i am conflicted. my dad is very emotionally unstable and my mom is a religious narc. i quit therapy back in hs because i was scared of my dad is temper, as he would usually drive me to therapy. i also stopped talking about my dreams, beliefs, and feelings because i am afraid of them. i have tried talking to them once, but quit trying because my dad would scream at me and my mom would yell. it sucked to because my sibling had to see it, and i didnt want to ruin his view on my parents he is the ideal kid for them, good grades, does sports, wants to be a doctor. is a christian, etc. . i have convinced myself that i have have recovered and do not self harm, but i dont know if i am sti will depressed. i have lost any wi will to do shit and have no drive to do or become anything. i dont want to have to deal with them anymore. i am tired of having to wear a mask around them, but can not take it off in front of them. i am scared to go back home, especially for spring print and the rest of the semster given the corona virus. am i being dramatic? and is the possibility of having to drop out and be homeless worth it?	not depression

i do not know what to say here everything is a fucking lie. my gf who broke up with me, my friends, my parents caring. it is all just a lie. i can not trust anyone without getting hurt. i had a gf for weeks before she decided to leave me when i did nothing wrong. i gave her so much love and affection like she wanted and it just was not enough for her. nothing is ever enough for people. i have never ever had affection from anybody before. and now that it is gone, i can not find a reason to want to move on. people say oh, it is going to get better or just hang in there . no. it is not going to get better, i can not just hang in there. i just can not. my parents take away my phone cause i told them i did not want to eat dinner and my flips out. she starts yelling at me blaming my phone for it saying i have become addicted to it when i used it this afternoon for only like fucking hours! and then she just goes to yell at my brother for what ever reason. and she is started to threaten to take my job away too. all i want now is loving parents, and a relationship that feels and is real. i am fucking sick and tired of the fucking bullshit i have to deal with in relationships and it breaks my heart to the point where i can not feel anything anymore. my mind hates my ex, but my heart wants to get back with her and i do not know what to do anymore. everybody pretends to care about me. everybody pretends to like me. i know they do not actually, i just go with it to try and trick myself into thinking they do. i do not see a future for me. i do not know why i try to go on anymore. and i just do not want to. but i am to much of a fucking pussy to do it. i have not met one irl person i did not hate in some way. i have not met on person i gave all my trust to. people just think they can just make fun of me, beat me up, and think i would not do anything about it. i do not know the only thing that feels real is schizophrenia. i never had the voices make fun of me. they never put me down. i know there no more real than the people, but they feel more real. i just do not know any more what is real and what is not.	not depression

coronavirus is ruining my life at the moment i live in the us, and the whole country is basically on lockdown. my family and i have already started on quarantining and everything to stay safe, and i hope everyone on the sub stays safe and healthy. how this relates to my depression is that i have to stay cooped up in my house and i do not know when it wi will end. i normally go and see a counselor to help me with things that are bothering me, and he really helps me to get back on a good path, and now with everyone having to stay home, i can not do that. also, my school is out because of the outbreak, and so i can not even see my friends, and i normally talk to them about stuff like sports and music to try to take my mind off stuff, and it helped me in really rough ti ames. other than that, in general has been a never ending circle of shit, as i went through a depressive state for a month and a half, which saw my grades drop off massively which caused even more stress in the family, and only a week ago, one of my closest friend is mother died, which put me even further into a hole, and now the coronavirus outbreak and having to isolate myself is the icing on the cake for me. i am not trying to feel sorry for myself or have a pity party in any way, i just want somebody to talk to about this, and i just want things to be normal again in my life.	not depression

stuck i am not sure where to start and i know i would not be able to mention everything, but here goes nothing. for starters, i work a pretty stressful job where work continues to get piled on me because high turnover rates. i am not even a year in and i might as well be a senior level employee with the amount of work i have on my plate. the pay is decent, but the location is isolated and young people my age are hard to come by. the young people that are here are not my speed. i want to go out on a friday night to drink, dance, and have fun, but none of the people around here do that and there nearest clubs are two hours away. all of my friends from school are spread out across the country and by now they are making new friends and we re becoming more thistant. the si ample solution here is find a new job closer to a city where i can make friends my speed, but i find my job challenging and if i can pull through somehow, i wi will have plenty of content to put on my resume. but even if i do stick it out for a couple more years then move, i am shy and have very low self esteem and am not sure that i would be able to make new friends even in a city. i am just not sure what i want and i am very afraid of change because my routine keeps me from being over stressed and falling into a depression. there is so much to think about and i do not know where to start. if you made it this far, thanks. i mainly needed this to get my thoughts out somehow since like i said, i do not have any friends nearby and my old friends do not have ti ame for me anymore.	not depression

my life exclai amer i do not expect any readers this is just for me sorry if that sounds selfish but i have never expressed myself in this way in any form ever so this is big for me.if you are reading though that is for caring enough so i grew up in a suburban area which was really a gated community of really nice people. outside my housing estate however was basically a ghetto but it was not always like that, it gradually turned worse and eventually my family moved our after my mom was even scared to walk to the shops on her own. anyway i had like best friends i wi will use fake names cause i am paranoid even though it is i ampossible they read this. brian james and hassan. so as a kid i always viewed myself as cool and was easy going and had quite a lot of friends. from ages i had a great life and have found memories of playing with brian james and hassan. james always thought brian was weird and he was right brian was very weird but in this enclosed community it was i ampossible to not be friends with someone because we were all we had. when i was i developed hyperhidrosis a condition where your sweat glands are over active and you basically sweat buckets for no reason all the ti ame. this was really thistressing for me as a kid at and i always had to change two someti ames three t shirts a day when playing outside. when i entered high school secondary school whatever you want to call it i became friends with many new people. i used to get insulted and mocked for my friend group because they were all weird in everyone is eyes but my own. i ruthlessly cut off my whole friend group and after a year of no friends i found a new friend group. over ti ame i slowly acknowledged how weird my old friends were and genuinely think most of them either have autism or other social mental i willnesses. i felt really bad when i cut my friends off but i did it regardless and the whole dynamic of the housing estate changed. i forgot how i did not have any friends outside of school and spent every minute of every day inside doing nothing feeling like a asshole. they used to walk around the estate constantly and always look in my windows as a jest to see if i was sti will on my own. maybe it was justified but all the same i was pretty miserable. i got invited to a party which you had to be a cool kid to go to and i did not understand party attire so i went up in tracksuit bottoms and bright green running asics shoes. everyone wearing jeans and whatever i got completely humiliated and it was like out of a movie i literally had everyone laughed at me looking me dead in the face i was so utterly crushed i went to a room where no one was and i sat on a couch by myself pretending to flick through my phone. i eventually went into the bathroom and called my mom to collect me early and i really held back the tears in the car home. all my supposed new friends had humiliated me and my old friends wouldn t take me back i was completely alone. from ages i used to stay at home all day everyday and i developed a really bad depression. i was completely numb and it was to the point where i could not even react to anything to evoke any emotion i felt like a robot. i spent my days in bed go downstairs to eat something back to bed. i developed a love for ani ame and tbh if i did not have ani ame i defiantly would have ki willed myself. i had a lot of suicidal thoughts brewing for years until finally i tried to take my like. i twisted two metal coat hangers around my neck hooked them up to my rack thingy in my closet that was up high and hung mysel. luckily the bar broke and my mom came running up the stairs like wtf and i just told her i was trying to do pull ups and broke the bar. i would get invited to social gatherings like playing football by my new friends ever so often especially at the start but i had developed such anxiety of going out and my sweating problem got so bad i could not wear any colors that would show sweat stains. the invites eventually stopped but in hindsight these friends were very shallow and i did not have any clothes that were hip or fashionable so i would have gotten ridiculed badly. i also developed a love for music especially rap and rnb. i have a specific memory of staying up all night crying my eyes out because i was so lonely and broken and i just wanted to die really and i got out of bed and was banging the back of my head against my drawer and scraping my legs and cutting my thighs and all this. anyway i had a huge moment where i just snapped and i had a huge hatred of everyone who did me wrong, i promised myself to live just so i could prove everyone wrong and i just hated them so much. i left that fake friend group and after a year of loneliness i found a genuine one that i played playstation with all the ti ame. it suited me because i had too much anxiety to go out and around this ti ame i started talking to girls on snapchat and insta etc. i became a really toxic person and i would go out of my way to lead girls on to then just fuck them off when i got bored. it gave me this power which i never really ever had and it was addictive. i played sports and went to the gym and i became really funny because i was fat my whole life and when your fat the only way for people to like you is if you are funny. so everyone started to treat me normal and that is where we are today. today i am years old and now my depression is back and it is affecting me so much i am unable to do my studies. it is bad because i have my state exams in a couple months well maybe not because of corona virus but sti will.i have gained a lot of weight from the stress of exams and i just have no meaning in my life no goals i wanted to become a psychologist and help others but by the ti ame i would be qualified to help others with my own practice i would be years old i can not live in my parents house for another years. my other option was to become a barrister and study law but i already know i would not like it and i am just applying for it for the status and it is eating me inside. i have no amitbion to do anything anymore and i really just want to die and be done of any decision making i do not want to get up at am and study i do not want to go to school and out on the same fake laugh fake demeanour i have most of my teenage years. any advice if anyone actually read this would be very helpful , this could be a cry for help but really i am old enough to acknowledge that i do not think i wi will ever get rid of this depression and probably wi will have it for the rest of my life thanks anyway for the platform to express myself	not depression
i am tired rant my parents get so angry over every little thing. i am so done. i can not leave because i am dependent on them, so please nobody suggest for me to leave, i can not and do not want to see anything saying that. i usually ignore it and think that is just how they are but today i literally burst into tears about it. bursting into tears is not new for me, it is a common thing and my room has soon a lot of those recently. let me list off today is rebellious acts . waking up at and not , not rushing downstairs to empty the thishwasher i was in the bathroom and i did do it once i came down , eating a bag of chips, and to top it all off, getting mad because i did not want salt in a health drink. let me give some context to the last thing. because of coronavirus, my mother bought gooseberry and neem juice and is having us all drink small amounts of it diluted in water every day to build up i ammunity. i do not know if it does but i do not care enough to research it. the mixture is not pleasant tasting but it is drinkable. at first i said that i wi will have it with room temperature water. nope, that obviously warranted being yelled at. my mother started going off and yelled at me to have it with warm water. strike one, i am now upset. strike two was when she started telling me that the things i did today were rebellious and my dad was incredibly upset because i did the things i explained above. leading up to strike , when i started crying was when i mixed the juices into the warm water and i turn around and see my mom giving me that look the face she makes when she wants to beat my ass . that instantly turns on my oh shit i have to leave mode in me, when i retreat to my room and stay there for a while and hideout. my parents do not come in there unless i really do anything wrong or if they need something from me, which is rare. i start tearing up and choking up. i quickly drink the mixture and came upstairs. the point is that i am so tired of the constant yelling and anger. being around this my whole life and especially since it is gotten worst over the last years definitely made my depression worse. it did not cause it i do not know what triggered it, it is been years since i have truly been okay so i do not know anymore but it is a factor that made it worst. i should not always be afraid. why am i always in fight or flight mode? i should not feel like every little thing is my fault. my sister can drop a glass and i wi will start shaking and thinking oh god, i am going to get yelled at . i would not but this behavior is now ingrained into my mind. i can not make it go away. i just want to be happy again. i ignored all of this when i was happy.	not depression
last ti ame a relative died, i did not feel much i could not feel much sorrow, because it is bound to happen to all of us, but i did feel some relief that there was one less person who would be affected by me ki willing myself. is this like really fucked up? or is it just something that someti ames comes with depression?	not depression
depressed about missing graduation look, i understand people have it worse. and i feel stupid for even being upset about this. people are dying and i am here being sad about missing my graduation. i just can not help myself. the past years have been shitty, after years of public high school i could not go on any longer and switched to online school for the remainder. it is been better for my mental health, but obviously online school means no friends, no normal school events, pretty much being deprived of a high school experience. we do however, get a graduation which i have been so excited for, since it is the closest thing i wi will get to having a normal high school experience, but it seems like with everything going on it is not going to happen. all i wanted is just one thing, not only to have a final, normal conclusion to my unusual high school years, but also to celebrate that i actually made it through when i was pretty confident i wouldn t. and now i would not. of course it happens to be my year.	not depression

all this talk about self isolating and how to do it due to the coronavirus... i wi will be honest, it is made me laugh considering i have been in self isolation for a few years now. reading these guides online about how to go about doing it and li amiting social contact, i must be an expert. i am sti will in my twenties so i believe there is a sli am chance of me dying from it. it has sort of woken me up and made me appreciate life more though. i just hope none of my family members get it.	not depression
i honestly do not know if i am depressed or i am just an annoying teenager most of the ti ame i am either really lonely even if i am surrounded by friends and fami willy or feeling numb and empty. i feel like i am going to colapse at any moment, and that scares me, because i have awlays been a normal kid, and now i want to cry all the ti ame and isolate myself. i think the situation has gone so bad to the point that i have lied so much that i have started do believe those lies, like yeah, i am just tired or nah, i am not sad or anything , and i feel that i lost myself in those lies, to the point that i do not even know who or what i am anymore. i feel like part of me is missing, i feel that theres a hole in my chest, that never goes away, exept when i thistract myself from it with other things i am sorry if i have made any gigantic spelling or gramatic mistake, english is not my first language and i know that my problem is not that big of a deal, so, i am sorry to bother you if you want to talk, i am here 	not depression

knowing people are stuck at home involuntarily actually makes me feel better for some reason it makes me feel like less of a useless shitbag knowing that so many people around the world are also stuck at home doing nothing, i am not missing out on any travel or socialising anymore because nobody is doing it. is it bad that i am sort of taking pleasure in the world feeling bad because i feel bad everyday? even though the world wi will recover quickly and i would not. it sucks that everyone is suffering but i feel less alone, at least for now. thanks for listening lol	not depression
growing up is like a fever dream its just so surreal and awful, i hate it. all the close friends you had start to change. they stop caring as much about you and focusing more on their own lives. they start to become rational adults and take care of their responsibilities and dont appreciate your personality because you are stuck acting like a child and having a mentality of a child. its so fucking weird seeing the people you knew and how they were so unique and now theyre all changing and rationalizing their dreams and fitting into a mold of an adult. meanwhile i am sti will acting like a fucking useless kid. i dont get it, i hate both sides, theres nowhere to go. i always wondered how grown ups got to be where they are, the people who steal or hate themselves or seem broken in some way, and i realize that this is the point, right after highschool is when the divide happens and everyone goes their separate way. i can tell i am diving into the path of becoming a scummy drain on society and probably fitting my own mold as well even though i dont see it. its just a pattern of losing all your close friends, being lonely, making shittier friends and surrounding yourself with shittier people, etcetera. all i want is people to care about me and friends to have my back but nobody else wants that. all adults do is care about themselves and stab each other in the back and that is what my whole world is becoming and i fucking hate it. i reject growing up and living but that rejection means nothing and only gets me trampled in the stampede of everyone else rushing to the finish line.	not depression
when i see my family that i have not seen in years, they always say i am so different and my dad said something along the lines of i know that sweet little boy is inside you somewhere but the truth is that sweet loving little boy died along with my innocence. i had to grow up at a very young age and it changed me as a person, yeah i am different, maybe worse, but my life has made me this way. i have hardened up, i feel nothing now, i am so depressed and apathetic, everyone says i am so nonchalant. and yeah, someti ames my anger gets the better of me, but my life has built that anger, even my sadness can turn into anger, i am mad at everything god, life, my parents, my financial situation, how shit is different than from my past, i could go on and on. but no. anyways idk. but yeah.	not depression
covid just majorly fucked shit up for me quick rant i know this is a serious pandemic and i definitely do not want to come off selfish so pls dont take it that way i recently moved to hk and being away from my best friends has really taken a toll on me. my best friend flew in all the way from canada on saturday to spend weeks with me planned a trip to bali but now with the closure of the canadian border and trudeau urging everyone to go home shes flying back lolz. this trip was something i was looking forward to it was absolutely my silver lining through all this turmoil but covid just royally fucked me over. i know i probably sound super privileged and shit but it is just really difficult to have something stripped away like that especially when it is something i had been depending on to pull me out of this dark hole. is it just me or does it feel like when things go south, they just keep snowballing until you are left in what feels like literal hell.	not depression
weird form of self sabotage? does anyone else end up hating whatever they are into or get mad at something they think they ought to should pursue? something in my head always tells me i am not worth it or whatever it is that seems cool to me is stupid and not worth my ti ame. i feel like a joke. also what i have noticed with things that are seen as beautiful or positive , make me angry, envious and self thisparaging. i do not get this and i do not know where it all started but it is eating me alive. i can not find true happiness.	not depression

having crush feelings is making me feel very depressed i have had a crush on this girl for about months already. i do not know her personally she do not know me, we do not have classes with each other, my brain just thinks she is ideal for me and i never had a big attachment to a someone until i saw her. i have had crushes in the past, but all my thoughts about them did not make me feel depressed, it made me feel excited and just happy if i was with them. for some odd reason, every ti ame i think about this girl specifically, all my insecurities just surface to my brain. i began to judge and compare myself to her superior traits and friends, and i began to view myself as ugly and dumb and not enough . i began questioning all the flaws of my life and self, and this i ampact had drained all the energy out of me. i feel extremely depressed now, sad, and someti ames i would cry and lay in my bed for hours thinking about shooting myself in the head. my parents do not understand, their words just fuel my pain and insecurities even more just by saying little things as if i am stupid or as if i could not do anything for myself. i do not know what to do, i tried to occupied myself with video games and youtube, but i just do not seem interested. i have no friends at all, i just need someone to talk to me and comfort me.	not depression
my box fan just broke at least before i could use the white noise from it so i could sleep peacefully, now i officially have nothing attempting to socialize does nothing for me anymore, i am tired of talking to people that sound like they are answering machines. when people talk to me at work i wi will just smile and laugh until they go away, recently i have even stopped doing that, instead resorting to just standing there and being like mhm everyone girlfriend, work, friends, family and everything video games, reading, playing with my cats, watching movies, drawing, writing i used to love feels like it has faded away. all of the color has faded from this place, i do not want to be on this planet anymore. i did not ask to be born but i guess it was nice while it lasted. while i felt alive. i am not going to ki will myself but i hope one day i just lose consciousness so i do not have to feel anything anymore i wish my box fan sti will worked	not depression
a general helpful post about coronavirus panic depressed anxiety. no, it is not the end. i am no expert about this first. but, i followed news about this from the early january. i have seen videos from china, had a clue it wi will turn into a pandamic. so, first if all in china. death rate was around for i guess , , cases. i have read posts about individuals getting recovered easily. it is scary. but, you probably would not die. mi willions of people in china where under lockdown. since, i knew about this from long ti ame but it looks like rest of the world is reacting now. look your body is i ammunity is the cure. best you can do, is sleep, eat, excercise. i understand it is scary in the beginning but weeks later it feels like old news and you wi will ignore it. i am so sick of reading it everywhere honestly. my mental state is at like i die, i die. which probably wi will not precautions i do not know what western media is telling you all. you got to wear masks, goggles. gloves and thisinfect phones, clothes. if you can stay home do not even bother going out. it is not worth it. things to do learn a new language i am learning spanish , binge watch a show. talk to your friends. remember ti ames when you wanted a holiday so bad. relax, it is not the end of world or you. many people in china according to the news videos i have seen got better in their home. i ammunity, doctors can not help much it is no way to take it lightly, but at the end of the world it is i amportant to keep in perspective that to take each day at a ti ame.	not depression

unsure of what i am experiencing. i do not know if we can put age gender here. i am and i have been hit with quite a bit recently. toxic, emotionally abusive marriage that i have walked away from, having to come home and live with parents which is not a healthy emotional environment , retaking some college courses, experiencing loss, etc. i know i am mourning a lot and i am working on myself in therapy whenever i can afford it. it is shown me a lot about myself. but i am sti will struggling a bit. i suffer with feelings of guilt, no direction, feeling constantly annoying or embarrassed? i know this is due to my upbringing. but it is crippling. i always just wish i could transport to mars and roll myself in a ball in darkness and totally isolated. i feel like i am such a waste of space. that i can not make decisions on my own because i can not trust myself in terms of being smart. that i have not a lot going for me. i do not have much of a support network and it is like i am having to learn how to survive in an oxygen depleted environment. a few months ago i moved away. i feel like i was trying to run from all of my problems. it did not help. but it was like a jog around the neighborhood because i ended up returning home after facing my issues head on. i really feel like the universe is placing me in a situation where i can not run anymore. when i move out again, it is for real this ti ame. not to run, but to start a future. and i am thisappointed because every chance i almost go again something happens. just had to bail on this apartment out of state due to the virus. but rounding this back to depression. i feel like i would be really dramatic to say i have it for some reason. like i am trying to get attention? but this constant guilt , shame , and worthlessness i feel about myself has been lingering for quite some ti ame. i always feel like i am in neutral. things do not really excite me. things do not make me feel fulfi willed, like hobbies or activities. it is tiring and exhausting. but i just call myself lazy. some people who knew i was going through a hard ti ame it is like they sensed it?! reached out and were so kind. and i almost feel worse because i did not reach out to them. i never want to bother anyone. i feel weird or that i do not mean as much to them and why would they want to hear from me. i know it is not true, but i do not want to burden people with a convo with me or something? and typing this out makes me kind of irritated because of this victi am mentality. it is not who i am. i feel so lost, like i have thisconnected from my soul. i have never been told directly that i am depressed, so i really do not know what i am feeling. or what is going on. if anyone knew i was feeling this they would not believe me because i have such a vibrant persona on the outside. i joke a lot, i laugh a lot, i know people think i am super happy and can manage. but it is so different alone. i do not really know if any of this makes sense, i know i am rambling. i just need to vent. but some kind words or advice would be greatly appreciated.	not depression

coronavirus affecting mental health rant mode it is funny. a month ago if you told me to stay at home and not talk to people, i would laugh and say it is what i do anyway. but ever since i started seeing friends. going to my psychiatrist again. trying to walk more. going to the gym more. even started doing hookups and even met a guy i actually like. started taking my antidepressants. and now all i hear is about how everyone is worried and we re all going to die, it is the beginning of the end and everyone is scared. do not get me wrong, i know it is a big deal and it is selfish of me but it pisses me the fuck off. it feel almost like a pisstake that this should happen now when i just started to have moments where i feel normal again. it does not help to be surrounded by everyone who is in constant fear and paranoia. i am already in constant stress and negativity in my mind but having everyone always speak about it just gets annoying and frustrating, like just at the moment where i actually feel like being positive everyone decides to be negative. i know it is for good reason and i am stupid for saying shit like this but ugh and due to border controls, i would not be able to see two of my very best friends or the guy i started seeing that i like. i can start to feel myself slowly slipping back again, especially since i relapsed into self harm habits only three days ago...	not depression

i am jobless and pathetic it was my mistake to resign from previous job. because i can not handle the stress. my manager constantly push me and he is not those type of people that can talk things out. i was under pressure and started to hate myself and everyone. i resigned because i can not coped with the working environment and the people who keeps pressuring me and using all the negative words to let me down. now i am jobless, my wedding is few months away. now that the virus is everywhere, people scared to hire a new comer. for weeks i am jobless at the moment and i am feeling guilty like hell. i am scared my fianc hate me for being incompetent partner. he didnt show me any hate or anything but i know he is thisappointed and angry. i am also worried not getting any job. i can not blame anyone but myself. i was too emotional and depress at the same ti ame while working at that company. i was not like that when i was working with another company. i have choose a lot of mistakes lately. i dont like making excuses, i am sti will looking and apply for jobs here and there but there is no news. my self confidence is crushing slowly, i am wondering why no one wants to hire me. i understand life must goes on but why its so hard? i want to vent so bad but i know my fiance dont like it when i do that. he wi will say that i only making excuses and always complaining. since then i never talk to hi am about anything. probably he got tired listening. i want to talk to someone but i dont have close friends nearby. i kept every emotion in me and feel like i want to explode. i feel like i want to cry in public other day for no reason. someti ames i do feel like i want ki will myself so i wi will not making trouble anymore. i am and i am pathetic.	not depression
fuck being sober amiright? my whole family is full of addicts, it is part of the shit that is ruined my family. i understand why they take the drugs though, i really do. they take them to escape their lives, i understand that because we have all had horrible lives. not only does crippling depression, severe anxiety thisorders, and other things, run in our family, but, we have all had horrible lives, i mean horrible, i do not think i have met another person who is had it worse than me and my family. i know people have it worse, like the kids in africa have it pretty bad. but compared to the rest of america, we re at the rock bottom. so yes i take drugs. just be glad i am not committing suicide, drugs are the only thing keeping me from doing it, i have nothing else anyways. i am not selfish enough to commit suicide, because that wi will just transfer my sadness to the people that care about me. truthfully no one cares, but they wi will if i am dead, they wi will say they have always cared. but where are they now? their off somewhere not caring about me. even my own mom does not care for me. drugs have ruined her brain. but i understand it. i truly do. i have peaked into her life story and it is not pretty. it is worse than mine. some of you wouldn t even believe some of the shit she is been through, it is taken a toll on her mental health, she does drugs to keep it all away. i know there is no fixing it. therapy and what now would not help. she is not a normal amount of fucked up. she is gone because she was broken. she told me sober living is bullshit and she was right. fuck being sober, being high is better than being dead. well, idk. but yeah.	not depression

inspiration the great dictator i am sorry, but i do not want to be an emperor. that is not my business. i do not want to rule or conquer anyone. i should like to help everyone if possible. jew gentile black man, white. we all want to help one another, human beings are like that. we want to live by each other is happiness. not by each other is misery. we do not want to hate and despise one another. and this world has room for everyone, and the good earth is rich can provide for everyone. the way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. greed has posioned men is souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose stepped us into misery and bloodshed. we have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. our knowledge has made us cynincal. our cleverness, hard and unkind. we think too much, and feel too little. more than machinery, we need humanity. more that cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. without these qualities life wi will be violent, and all wi will be lost. the aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. even now my voice is reaching mi willions throughout the world mi willions of despairing men, women, and little children victi ams of a system that makes men torture and i amprison innocent people. to those who can hear me, i say do not despair. the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. the hate of men wi will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people wi will return to the people. and so long as men die, liberty wi will never perish. ... soldiers! do not give yourselves to brutes men who despise you enslave you who regi ament your lives tell you what to do what to think and what to feel! who dri will you diet you treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. do not give yourselves to these unnatural men machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! you are not machines! you are not cattle! you are men! you have the love of humanity in your hearts! you do not hate! only the unloved hate the unloved and the unnatural! do not fight for slavery! fight for liberty! in the th chapter of st luke it is written the kingdom of god is within man not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! in you! you, the people have the power the power to create machines. the power to create happiness! you, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. then in the name of democracy let us use that power let us all unite. let us fight for a new world a decent world that wi will give men a chance to work that wi will give youth a future and old age a security. by the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. but they lie! they do not fulfil that promise. they never wi will! dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! now let us fight to fulfil that promise! let us fight to free the world to do away with national barriers to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress wi will lead to all men is happiness. in the name of democracy, let us all unite	not depression

how not to be destructive i have been spamming and harsh to my long thistant boyfriend. both young adults, we live a few hours apart and he is bed ridden for a number of months. i have already met hi am. the only reason i rather post this here than a relationship thread is cause i have too much depression. i have told hi am this when we were friends. i do not think he understands. anyways besides that i have been spamming hi am when he ignores me cause my mind can not make itself up. i get confused, mad, sad, insecure. i want to act mature but it hurts when i get swallowed up by my own thoughts. and then when i ask hi am if he thinks i am pretty or if i am a moron. he does not respond or just says i am cute nothing else... the bare mini amum. it is not very convincing to me that he likes me. i told this guy i love hi am. the feeling is not mutual yet but i do not think it wi will ever be cause i fucked up big ti ame. i am just lonely... at least he is giving me rules instead of just dumping me. idk why he is giving me this one last chance... i do not feel like he likes me at all and this just pity idk why. i feel like one stupid thing i do wi will make hi am ignore me anyway. i am tired	not depression

self isolating this coronavirus stuff got me all isolated and i realized how lonely i am. i tried going on social apps like tinder and i have a pic up and i realized i am fucking ugly. no one adds me back and it just established my intrusive thoughts that i am ugly. i hate feeling ugly and having no self esteem. it feels like depression and anxiety are intertwined in me. i make subtle jokes about hoping to not wake up to my friends and deep down i am just asking for someone to reach out. it sucks because i know no one wi will ever understand me.	not depression

just so sick.. i am sick of everything. i am sick of being tired, i am sick of being sad, and i am fucking sick of being suicidal. i am so sick of myself and feeling like i have no one to talk to. i am scared of what they think. i am scared of how they wi will react. there is so many people i am scared to hurt so i just have to bite my tongue and hurt myself instead. i can not tell if it is been worth it. i have tried getting help. the meds i take make it worse but i am scared to just stop taking them. every therapist i have gotten has eventually dipped for personal reasons and i can not rely on them. i have even tried suicide, but i survived and it is only made shit worse. nothing works anymore. why do i even feel like this? i have everything i could wish for. i am young, i have great friends and a great partner, i have a loving family and a great home life, yet i sti will fall into episodes. i think too much, i remember too much, it is all just too much. i wish i could sleep it away yet never have up at the same ti ame.	not depression
thanks for everything i have gotten a lot of comfort from this subreddit. i am doing tonight. i have a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of trazodone. i know none of you know me, but i guess i just wanted to say goodbye to someone. i have a son. he is months old and is with my parents right now. my husband is leaving me because i slept with someone else. i deserve to die. i wish i could tell my parents and family that i love them, but this is as close as i wi will get. if you are religious, pray for me. i did not live a good life and i need it. thanks.	not depression

my friends are becoming strangers it hurts me to type the title and look at it, but here i am. i have always been not so great at making friends and i tend to stick with the few friends i have. over the last two years, i would become close with two people i would consider my best friends. i knew a lot about them, they knew a lot about me, we had classes together, talked, texted, we did what best friends did. my friends have always been my favorite part of school. but recently this school year , i have noticed that we have drifted apart a lot. we no longer have classes together, so we do not usually see each other, we do not talk, and we do not text. i used to do all these things with them, but now i feel so thisconnected. i wouldn t know a thing about anything that is happened in their lives within the last or months. i do not know why we are not close anymore. are they tired of me? have they moved on while i have stagnated? they probably do not like me anymore and have made new friends, while i have stayed friends with the few i already had. i do not have many friends and i really truly miss them, even though they have not technically gone anywhere. has anyone else gone through this? i wish things could go back to before, when we really were best friends. i sti will think of them as my best friends, but now i barely know them... someti ames it feels hopeless, like breaking the awkwardness and letting it all out to them would not fix things, it wi will only make them worse. does anyone have advice please? thank you.	not depression

i need someone. hey. i have been going through a breakup lately. we didnt break up in a fight, but because of many. we said we wi will be friends. in the weeks since i tried to do something anything with friends i really only have left rightnow. never had many, but i thought they where close ones. i pride ed my self, with having one as a brother i allways got no ti ame busy stressed etc. wich i get. but then these went to the cinema with my ex and her sister in a movie i was very interested in, and they knew saw in insta storys . the funny thing is, our relationship ended mainly, because i needed more ti ame with my partner then her. she was very keen on alone ti ame, but then my friends dont make something with me, but with her. i asked them, we forgot was all the answer i got. later i wrote to my best friend how shitty i feel he answered that text like and why do you feel shitty again now? i said that i am alone , i have no one i am not close with my family, despite living with them mom and brothers and that i just tried to do something with people without pressuring someone. i asked, if it would be okay if i came the next day. he confirmed, but was away before the ti ame we said we d meet. he then said that i wi will not have ti ame until the following this week. funny thing, he did nothing on sunday. when i went to vote, i wet past his house. i saw it before in insta storys, but he and my otger friend where just laying in the drive way. it was of the clock pm i went up to tgen, and sat down, and talked with them. aperantly they where doing this since , after drinking they day before. while one of them knew i was feeling awful alone at home, and the other definately knew i wanted to do shit they had no shame telling ne that. they celebrated one of them passing his exams. a thing i asked ti ames about, while i always made sure to wish hi am good luck for the exams. i found out through my brother, nobody told me. i feel like i am free falling, and i have nothing to grab to. the only thing i can hold on is a date with a girl i really like, but met last almost years ago. but that wi will not get to a relationship, because she studys car hours away. but i dont know what would happen, if i wouldnt have that. i can not stand lonelyness i was single and lonely for years before i got my girlfriend. before we broke up we had a pause. i thought i could make it weeks, but with my stress at work, wich i also had to deal with alone, and no personal conection, and so much fear i called her just over a week later. i wanted to talk to her friday it was tuesday but she said tomorrow would be okay it wasnt, because she complained, tgat i couldnt give her more ti ame . just as a funny side note we broke up that day, mutualy. i was relieved to know whats up atleast, but i knew the following ti ame would be bad for me. i didnt expect that shit. i just need someone to come to.	not depression

my dad had to explain to me that high school parties are a real thing. i graduated years ago and i genuinely thought high school parties were only from tv because i was never invited to or told about one. i am not going to college either so to my knowledge, college parties do not exist either. i was going to commuter college but dropped out. i can not afford to go back for the forseeable future either. social isolation is really doin it to me.	not depression
i do not even get it i do not really get why i am like this. probably just something messed up in my head but it is annoying and stupid. i am not sure if it is just teenager ness or something that ll follow me into adulthood. i have a perfectly okay life. i am on the track team at my school, have a thing with this girl i really really like, have a loving family, and lots of friends. despite all that, i feel like shit a solid of the ti ame with little splatters of okay every once in a while and if i am lucky, an actually happy few hours. unfortunately, those shitty periods end up with me hurting myself, isolating myself, being an asshole, vaguely calling out for help and getting hurt when no one notices or gives a shit, and when it is real bad thinking about ending it. my mood can also change real quick with no real reason in either direction. my parents know about part of this and they do their best but i just can not let them know. can not really let anyone know except internet strangers i guess cause i do not trust people. anyways, i si amply do not understand why i am so wack. thank you for coming to my ted talk.	not depression
is there anything you genuinely enjoy in life big or small? is losing joy just growing up too early? i know this is a hard question to ask a depressed person, but this is something that i want myself to sit and think about and hopefully others in this subreddit and i feel like talking about it wi will help at least a few. i am sitting here in my cold room looking at all the stuff i like to keep me busy, guitar, videogames, social media anything on my phone, my friends, my family, books. i enjoy all of this stuff but when i look back at the happiest moments in my life i either do not get the chance to do what i love anymore, or i just do not love the few things that did used to make me happy. now i just sit in my room thinking about what i can do different, but at the same ti ame, i do not think doing things different wi will change how i feel. where did my i amagination as a kid go? my favorite thing was pretending i was a super hero. i used to spend hours playing games as a kid never getting bored. i used to love running, now i can not even convince myself to go for a walk, i used to work out too and i fucking loved that. hikes too now i need someone to invite me to even think about doing that. i used to spend hours a day on my guitar reading everything about it and learning a lot. hell even finding a good show on netflix was enjoyable. i used to be worried about finding someone i liked, and i did, but trying to find someone else? it is been years and i do not care. now? i can not be bothered and currently i like it better that way and i hate that.	not depression
my husband stopped talking to me when i am sad i am and do not have much to show for it. failed at one job, went back to college, demand for that field dried up in my last month of school, so now i am trying a trade but not making much progress. i thought i would have kids by this point in my life, but the money is not there. i do not think it wi will ever be there. i feel like life is a constant struggle and mostly miserable. i have tried therapy, but at this point my doctor agreed i am not really depressed, my life situation just sucks.and now i am thinking, why even have kids when life is so empty and hard? someti ames i try to talk to my husband when i am feeling hopeless. but this has been going on for years. i keep saying how i wish things would get better, easier ... but they never do. he is run out of things to say back, i guess. you can only say it wi will get better she many ti ames before you re tired of saying it. or maybe he also realizes they would not. i do not have any hope anymore.	not depression

how to deal with feeling alone? i have zero friends, and have never been in a relationship. i do not belong anywhere. i have never been in a relationship and i am already years old. my brain just keeps telling myself that no one is going to like me i am too quiet, i am a homebody, i am not adventurous, i do not have any friends so i am a loner. i just feel like there is nothing special enough about me for someone to choose me or want to be with me more than anyone else. i am a nice person that listens, that is about all i have going for me. i want to meet people, but no matter what i do i feel like i do not belong, i am not enough of anything to belong to certain groups of people i am always an outsider. i so badly want to meet other people, so i wi will feel less alone. i unfortunately isolated myself socially for the past years because of social anxiety and it has made it so i have no clue how to even have friends. can anyone relate? am i alone?	not depression

i wi will never be happy or successful because of past mistakes people say things like forget your past, do not think about your past because you can not change it, etc. this is such bullshit. you wi will be punished for your entire life because of past mistakes. quiet as a kid? congrats, you re now a socially awkward introvert for life. fat as a kid? you can work out and have a healthy diet but you ll never have a body like people who were never fat. had a drinking or drug problem? you wi will never get back those lost years and any intelligence health you lost as a result. missed an opportunity? never connected with a possible friend partner? you wi will never get those chances again. i hate it when people act like you can just pick up from where you are and make things better. people live and they make mistakes. those mistakes change you, they compound and they change your future. it is not true that you can achieve anything. maybe when you re a kid, it is true to an extent, but as soon as you start getting to adolescence, the choices you make start putting you on a track in life, and it is near i ampossible to get off that track. people fuck up their lives, and there is no way to fix it. you just have to live with the fucked up life forever. a lot of the ti ame there is not really anything you can do other than hope for the best . i see people talk about their sadness and loneliness as reasons for wanting to ki will yourself. what about people who feel like they have just made a few too many wrong decisions in the game of life? what are people like that supposed to do? how can you keep living when you know that you wi will never achieve x, you wi will never reach your full potential, you wi will never live your dreams? why live when you have no hope of making things better? why live when you have to cope with all your past mistakes? it is hard to just forget your past and live in the present when that means living with all your fuckups which affect your current situation.	not depression

angsty meaningless rant lurker for years now. doctor diagnosed me a couple years back after seeing hi am about my low moods. i might be at my breaking point. i can not feel anything but despair and hopelessness. not going to preach my story to an audience right now nothing against those who do , maybe venting a little here might help. nothing excites me anymore. reading and video games seem like pointless, petty misdirections. i can not remember what it was like to enjoy anything. i am a black hole that drains the shine away from others. tired and confused ranting is what i am fucking doing right now. everything is a fucking torturous thistraction. i just want to scream and gouge my eyes out. my life is an incomplete stick figure hanging from the rafters, it is a nightmare being dreamed by a body and mind that are not my own. the days breeze by with unnerving haste. i feel like i am not in control, that i have never been and never wi will. i do not think anyone is... so what are the forces that hurled me into this fucking prison and locked me up and threw away the key? why can not i hold down a fucking job without losing my shit to low moods? i can not figure out why i think the way i do, why i can not see what everyone else can not seem to take their eyes away from. fear and emotional sti amuli dictate the lines the actors memorize, and as you get older, the plot loses focus, the actors forget their lines and those who put on a poor performance are laughed off stage, then the audience fucking leaves anyway! i wish i had no tolerance. i want to be high forever, rather than stuck in this dream, this composite idea we call life. the faceless and emotionless are locked away in the abattoir, as usual, but we re all thrown into the same bottomless pit. so many fucking ways to end it, man. it is like god created us pissing hi amself laughing. we are born nothing and we are tortured until we die as nothing. yeah, i should probably seek therapy. i am aware of that fact, also be aware i am off my meds again after feeling so fucking numb and indifferent. just a matter of ti ame... tick tock	not depression

i do not know why i am writing this. i am , gay and live in a conservative caribbean country. i have never really been a very social person but ever since i realised that i was gay when i was i have slowly been isolating myself. now it is at the point where i can go months at a ti ame without leaving the house. i feel like i have lost all ability to function socially. i feel a highly anxious whenever i interact with anyone i do not know and only feel safe when i am alone in my room. for whatever reason i have always been ok with being gay and, have always known its not something to be ashamed of and, that it is something that can not be changed. but to be honest i think that is part of the perfect storm that created this situation. i think if i hated myself then that would allow me to lie to myself, push down my feelings and move on with my life. but instead my acceptance of myself made me isolate myself so that i can feel some amount of safety. so now i am trapped. i have no one in the world i can trust. i am basically a hermit. i am depressed and have high social anxiety, and probably need treatment for that. but can not get treatment because i do not have a job. and i can not bring myself to get a job because i am socially anxious and depressed. i feel like a useless piece of shit for writing that. i do not want to try anymore. to be honest i do not know that i would try to change even if i got help. the most fucked thing is that i dont want to die, though i really wish i did. there is a big part of me that sti will sees the person that i could have been if things had been different. but at this point i can not i amagine how i could ever become that person. and it is not worth living as the person i actually am. i just want it to end.	not depression

this virus might ki will me i know i am not alone feeling this way on here, but i do not know if i can survive this virus. first, my school was moved online, my work schedule was changed completely, a girl i am really interested in told me she can not be in a relationship now after we were inti amate which really got me attached to her , i have to move out from my grandparents house to my mothers, where i am reminded of the depression i had before i moved out here. i could lose my job, and of course, i should not go hang out with friends. i want desperately to be loved right now, but i am asked to put that on hold for this virus. i worked harder than i ever have to build my life back into something i could work with, and it was taken out from under me so fast. i know you all do not know a ton about me, but i could really use your support right now. you re the only community i have.	not depression

wi will a stupid person made it through life? i am always that one person that people feels awkward around and talk differently to, compared to how they talk with their friends. i am socially awkward and anxious, and i always feel like a sore thumb that sticks out, sooner or later. i am slow mentally, i process information poorly and someti ames i can not even follow instructions. i si amply messes up everything i do. i have no strength advantages. nothing that i do is well and proper, no matter how hard i try. i have no passions goal to work towards and i am not so sure why i am even here. when people asks what my career goal is, i si amply just say generic stuff that i can do with my degree, but not what i can do well passionate about. i actually feel like i am mentally retarded and i can never see how my future in the next five year wi will turn out other than derailing as an useless human being. everyday i just feel like all energy is drained and i always feel like i am incapable of change. everyti ame when i try to change, i messes up, and people starts laughing despise me. someti ames i do not even see the point of living, but i am even a coward who is afraid of death suicide. i can not do anything right.	not depression
failed rant i failed engineering. because it got too hard. then switched to an easier degree. it got too hard because college sucks, the college i went to hard girls engineering . attractive girls. only had friends. had social anxiety in high school so no girls there either. so i couldnt stand it anymore, i amagine being early twenties and literally stuck in that situation i got sick. i didnt like engineeeing that much you know. unless you are good at math, if you go engineering then you have no life. lots of other students had no life either. but somehow didnt lifeget depressed. i got sick of it. i was always doing other stuff. damn. so i wonder, if i could go back in ti ame, should i have gone to psych and get ketamine or whatever? so many here on reddit love medication. check anti depressant poop out effect, ie tolerance. and why should you take deugs to get rhrough a fucking degree?.? this society is fucking stupid. you shouldnt have to half ki will yourself to do well in this fucking society.	not depression

that feeling when you figure out a piece to your puzzle i am not exactly sure how to describe this feeling. if you re like me, you have been living in the dark. you struggle to understand why you are the way you are, why you re so sad, and why you re so lost. every so often i feel like someone tells me something or through great internal scuffle something that opens my eyes a little bit, a piece to the puzzle of why i am living the way i am. it feels like hope, even if its just a little bit. they come by so rarely but even that little piece helps lift my spirits, gives me a reason to keep pushing on, i suppose. i do not really know how to describe it other than this sudden burst of tranquility as your eyes are opened just a little bit more. it is been about years since i was classified as clinically depressed and i have only come by just a few of these pieces . living with depression this long numbs your emotions but when this happens it reminds me what it means to feel alive. i do not know if my depression wi will ever really go away, this void within me caused by delusion and uncertainty has been fi willed with this intense but everlasting aura of pure sadness. unfortunately, this sadness has attached myself to my soul, and it wi will always be a part of me as a result. but the drive to find more of these pieces is whats keeping me alive. for now, at least. thank you for taking the ti ame to read.	not depression

i used to be happy i was happy when i was younger. i never thought depression or despair would ever reach me. i was full of life, energy and hopes for the future. all those things are now gone, especially the energy. i wouldn t say i am the smartest brainiac in my area, nor the dumbest, but i do consider myself having above average intelligence. i took an iq test when i was younger and received a score of , i am an ib diploma recipient and was very active in extracurricular activities during my public school years. i did not have the best childhood and i saw things that children should not see, but despite the situation i was in, i was sti will hopeful for the future. my dream was to leave one day and never look back. i wanted to go on an adventure of my own and leave my dark past behind me. my parents were always living their own lives and made me feel like a hindrance to them. when i was years old my mother found out my father was being unfaithful. at first, she rejected both my father and me. i would seek her and she would yell at me to stop annoying her. i found some compassion from my father when he was around, sadly he was rarely around. she packed the few things we had and moved us to another state. i wouldn t say she was the worst mother ever, but she was not making the situation better either. she would leave with friends during the night and leave me with people who we did not know very well. because of her reckless decisions, i was molested repeatedly. i never told anyone until i was older. when i was years old my father visited us for the first ti ame. my mother told me to be good and to not tell hi am what she had been up to. they rarely paid attention to me during this ti ame. they would lock themselves in a room and i would play outside with the rocks. when the day came for my father to leave, i wept and begged hi am to stay. he promised he would be back the following weekend, so i waited outside every single day, rain or shine. he returned two years later. i do not blame one parent over the other for the things i had to endure during my childhood. things weren t exactly good before the affair either. my mom would whip me and slap my mouth for insignifican not things. i would see gang violence regularly since gang members shared a room in the same apartment. i found solace in the single book available in the apartment a catholic bible, full of pictures of saints and jesus. my parents took me to church one cold night. outside was a crucified statue of jesus. i was years old when i laid eyes on the white stone. i remember weeping inconsolably b c somehow i knew he was hurt and cold. i tried to take my coat off to cover the statue, but my parents told me we were going to get a blanket from the apartment. ever since i can remember i have had a connection with god. something inside me always knew that god loved me and that no one else is love mattered. i was a sad kid, sure, but knowing that god loved me was enough for me. i kicked my ass in school b c i was determined to run away. when i started my junior year in high school, things went south. i could hardly sleep due to sleep paralysis and night terrors and it got progressively worse. my first experience was when i was years old, but it got worse to the point i was afraid of sleeping. i could feel an evil presence in the room during the paralysis and it would whisper things i could not understand into my ear and would lick me. it got so bad i missed a lot of days my senior year and i was so tired i had to tell someone, so i told my counselor. they helped me as much as they possibly could, but it was not enough. eventually i experienced leaving my body and being in another realm. i know it sounds ridiculous, but i am trying to describe my experience as best as i can. needless to say, i was petrified. i got sick of it, so i took matters into my own hands and started gathering information from whatever books i could find about these experiences. somehow, after years, i was able to control it and wi willingly stop the vibrations. i do not know what was happening, perhaps i wi will never understand, but ever since then i was never the same anymore. i remember entering my body again after begging god to help me. i saw a mandala looking portal that sucked me inside. i remember seeing so many colors, shapes and hearing beautiful chi ames. i woke up panting and with an ice cold sensation on the top of my head. i know that whatever those experiences meant, god was watching. i sti will experience odd things like that from ti ame to ti ame, but i have learned to stop it deliberately. during my senior year in high school i fell into a deep depressive state because of my experiences and because of the problematic relationship i was in. as you can i amagine, college was very difficult and i contemplated suicide multiple ti ames a day. i ended up dropping out and started school again two years later. i am sti will in school, but i am afraid of making the wrong career choice. you can not just do what you love anymore. you have to make sure your major is marketable to find a job out of school. i can feel my hopes, motivation and energy seeping out of me because i can not find anything career wise that brings me joy. i am good at everything, but talented in nothing. i learn very quickly, but get bored after a while. every semester i start very motivated, but then that motivation leaves me and i start feeling depressed again b c i feel like that wi will always be my life. i feel stuck and all i want to do is sleep to get away from the pain and thisappointment, but i can not. i have realized that i need a purpose in my career. a purpose that does some good in this world. what that is, i do not know. the only thing i know is that i want to make the world a better place for all organisms. i feel like if i am serving something greater than myself, i wi will never feel unmotivated b c everything i wi will do wi will be rewarding. i feel lost and i want to find my place. i have come to accept the fact that no one wi will ever care for me and i am okay with that. i just want to be useful. i know that my analytical ski wills are my forte and i want to find a career that requires them so that i may better serve the world. i do not realy care about acceptance or bonds, i just want to be an integral part of society, so that i may die knowing that i left behind a better place. i do not mean to bother anyone with my long post, i just needed to tell someone.	not depression

just when i thought it was all getting better.. i have my first job interview in months tomorrow, i was nervous but excited. i thought that maybe this was the turning point, maybe i could put my life back on track. my father made some comments that sort of annoyed me and when i went to leave he started screaming calling me lazy, degrading me and acting like he is the one who gets no respect. i ran to my room, slammed the door shut and just cried in the dark. when my mum came to comfort me i told how her the truth, how he was one of the reasons i stood on the edge of a cliff and considered jumping off. how i just want hi am to love me and be proud of me. but no matter what i do, no matter how hard i try. it is not ever good enough. i am never good enough.	not depression

insane people around me due to coronavirus, ive had no school since monday, my parents got mails from school saying online classes would be held. it was to start from today, that is tuesday, and we were supposed to ask the teachers about what we found difficult etc. in my case, i have an exam and because i finished my syllabus me and my classmates are not invited to any classes such my sister. my mom walks in on me going through a powerpoint and starts shouting about how i should be in a class and how i need to write on my books and everything. as i was trying to explain to her what i was really doing, she shouts at the top of her lungs and calls my dad. my dad gives me more bs and because theyre not even trying to understand how i am supposed to studying for my exams i start raising my voice trying to make them understand, short while later my dad cuts the phone and my mom is just being a bitch about what i am supposed to do and everything. during this some words come through my mouth, which are rude, and i admit that theyre rude. but to escalate this even further my mom decides to make a big, and i mean big deal about this and starts madly swearing. this makes me infuriated and i walk away and slam the door. after this my mom spoke some words that compleately broke me, she started crying and exclai aming how i shouldve never been born and how i am just a mojor failure in everything... i amagine your mom ssaying that. that hurts man. i knew that i was a mistake they told me this before how they even took abortrion pi wills and then later stopped but that hurts. and then i started crying infroknt of my computer. then after half an hour of continious cursing and taking my name, it was lunch ti ame and my mom came in my room, physically bullied me and told me that i need to eat food. doesnt seem very motherly does it? and after all that my maid came afterwards looked at me crying and instead of understanding the situation and leaving me alone she thinks the best thing to do is to go and talk to a loser about how good her daughter is at everything. after indirectly telling me how big of a loser i am and how good her daughter is at everything she tells me, you are a big boy, big boys should never cry, even if their mom tells them bad things now keep in mind that i am , this just remindended me how much of b.s. i am going to get in with my dad after he comes home. and for those of you who are wondering. this isnt even my step mom. i am sorry if you wasted ti ame reading this bs i just needed to lay it down somewhere.	not depression
lost i am writing here because i have nowhere else to say this fyi this is a throwaway account i have major depression thisorder been in and out of hospital ti ames and social anxiety has got me to the point where i barely take any of my uni classes and mostly go out to get groceries and stuff round night when there is less people. i am currently rolling on xan bars so if my grammar is terrible i am sorry because drugs are mainly my go to during a relapse which is bad i know. during my high i came to realize that i am the friend that is left out or at least the one they dont have ti ame to talk with, whereas when they want something from me they wi will hit me up knowing damn well i wi will not say no which i should but i find it easier to keep them at peace i wi will listen to what they have got to say and all and as soon as i bring something to the table its as if i am just another ant on the kitchen floor if they ignore it itll leave. it may be the xans talking but i doubt it but its left me really empty thiscovering this. i am just an asset to them nothing more... i know this is a throwaway account but any good advice would be helpful	not depression

coronavirus creating anxiety and isolation graduating from college and this happens it know it sounds si willy and selfish in the wake of this but this was going to be my senior semester of college. i was already pretty terrified honestly that it was ending so soon. so much left to do. not sure where i was headed in the future do i return home? apply for grad school? internships? stay in the city i go to college in? i was working hard and sti will cultivating new friendships. i was trying to make and maintain connections and was planning on staying at my student apartment through the summer to continue hanging out with my friends before i departed. then my parents convinced me to come home for break during this coronavirus scare, school campus is shutting down, people being told not to socialize. seems like my state may go on lockdown any day now. i feel like shit. i know they would not postpone graduation. i am going to graduate, just maybe without a ceremony or without really getting to see my classmates again before it. it just feels like everything i have worked for is just kind of over. like that. overnight. i feel like shit, i can barely sleep, and every minute it feels like they could cancel my flight back at the end of the week and i wi will be stuck at home. this really upsets me. i have no motivation to do anything. i honestly feel like giving up on my classes and just tanking it this semester. i would honestly rather start over than just kind of fade out. that is what this feels like. like i am fading out. no goodbyes. no celebration. i have sunk so many hours into stupid projects and fucking on campus jobs and finally it is my ti ame to just rest on my laurels and have fun... and i get to sit at home on my laptop waiting for this thing to end... which everyday they are saying is going to take longer and longer. i honestly feel like shit and feel like i have wasted my ti ame. i am honestly only posting this because i can not sleep because it is all i keep thinking about. i tend to get depressed if forced to isolate. which is ironic because typically i have low self esteem. i undervalue myself. i feel like i am always the one who has to reach out. i feel like i am exhausting to be around and people thislike me. i know it is because people are busy but that is not what it feels like. i oftenti ames feel like a pest, even if the people i reach out to always or usually reciprocate. so i kind of isolate anyways but i have the freedom to hang out if i wish. i can go out and grab a cup of coffee and just kind of enjoy the atmosphere of wherever i am at. i can go to places on campus and meet friends. i engage with different people in classes. so there is sti will a lot of connections. now i am going to be holed up in my room, trying to figure out why i am even trying anymore. i am not even sure returning to school would help all that much. it is honestly making me resent this mass coronavirus panic. and i know that is shitty, because it is obviously a major issue, but nonetheless that is how it is effecting me mentally. it is just been a series of thisappointments lately, none of which i particularly want to delve into. it is just a lot has piled on and i have a lot on my mind. nothing objectively catastrophic, a lot of it is just my own neurotic personality, but i hope everyone can understand how even little things can feel overwhelming when they happen all at once. it is just so much bad ti aming at a really critical turning point in my life. i even have the fear i wi will never see some of my college friends again depending on how long this thing goes. like i never got to give them a proper goodbye. even if that winds up not being the case, right now it seems like a possibility, and that makes me deeply sad. i genuinely struggle with these moments. i someti ames get overwhelmed by intense emotions i can not control, i wind up fixating intensely on the negative, i have been having outbursts more frequently since this whole thing transpired. again, if this had happened to me even last year, i probably wouldn t have been so freaked out. but it is just happening at a really critical moment for me. and i hate it.	not depression
it does not get better, despite the oscar winning opti amism people exibit. i have come to terms with how depression really is inseparable and permanent. the symptoms can subside temporarily but it never vanishes. it is been a decade almost and my life had changed in a myriad of ways but in the end i am always back here. never enjoying life, living it passively and because i have to. from the start you re given a lesser of two evils scenario that you never consented to. you either get shaped by the world or you leave it. the latter of course being fucking i ampossible.	not depression

glitched or cursed the first years of my existence hi you may not know me but i am azriel form the philippines. i am years old living with my family happily. happiness is just the tip of the iceberg to any emotions of any person . this is my current quote i have. i have been depressed for years since after i have ended my elementary days and currently ongoing to senior high school. the reason i am depressed is because bullying. my origin of bullying dates back to where i am graduating from preparatory trust until when the awarding came, i cried because of not awarding a medal. this was the main starting point before after years of being bullied. i would not detail too much on my elementary days because it is too sensitive to talk about. there is a stereotype filipino boys must follow, boys do not cry, they must be strictly tough that stereotype influenced all boys because father is are reminding to their son s. from grades to i had been bullying non stop almost every day. by grade it went calm but not too much but when grade came, this would trigger the foundation of my depression. with the last week of my elementary days, they bullied me nonstop unli amited because of my attitude background from prep to grade . they bullied me all day. it was so heavy, no one cared except my friends and family. i have been guidanced since grade to because of this issue. as i approach high school, i was expecting the same, and it did by grade in march it was announced that the school wi will be renovated and i did not cried not a single tear because my school did not treated about bullying. within grade was a new life because i studied at a christian school and i have met one of my classmates form prep. i wi will hide the name champaine. i have met her in roosevelt college cubao as a prep. student. however there is one student who came from public school last year. he was treating me like hidden bullying . in overall i had a great experience from this christian school and continued here for grade . by grade i am expecting one bully but it went multiple. there are of them, boys and girl but i would not name them because of my personal reasons. these were i hated the most but afraid to report because it has been repeated in my elem days. also in this ti ameline, i had a crush on the one i have been her classmate last year. however i did something i did not know it was i willegal. on march , i have photographed her without asking her permission. they have caught the evidence i have did but i had nothing to do. that was on march , when they are scattering it. within that date, i had lost interest on her and i have promised to myself that i am not going to flirt another girl after i went home by p.m. and waited until p.m. i cried while mt little brother was sleeping because i think myself as a failure to this world. i am trash, useless, worthless. i wanted to suicide so much i have handled my scars since i have been bullied. it was too much pressure to handle like i hope one day i wi will die just one day to see who does care about me this is why unti will now am i glitched or cursed? despite i did not went to a specialist in mental health there was a treatment i have found, coldplay i have been following coldplay since grade and their music relates me wether i am happy or sad and i encourage you to listen some of their music like fix you, everyday life, a sky full of stars, yellow, viva la vida, up and up, parathise and so much more. i hope you have read it and if you re posting it on fb, ig, twitter, yt or any other social media sites pls. feel free to notify me. as chris martin said believe in love thank you for reading this post and hoping for you to visit the philippines. just remember believe in love 	not depression

cleaned the whole apartment after months of not being able to i have not cleaned my place for months. i have been struggling a lot with the smallest of tasks. thishes would pile up until i had to wash them. i tidied up my room and living room in these months every now and then but no actual cleaning. well last week i got the motivation to declutter. my mother moved out which means i was finally able to get rid of all the stuff she was hoarding. it was a lot and by the ti ame i was finished i had no energy to get out all the stuff my boyfriend did . i had no energy to clean. last night i did not sleep at all. i was thinking about cleaning the house and that kept me up until late, at that point i decided to not sleep at all so i could be able to get up early and clean. ever since the quarantine i have been struggling with oversleeping, i do not have practice so i do not have a reason to wake up in the morning. staying awake worked though, i cleaned the whole kitchen, room, living room, indoor patio and bathroom. it took me all morning but it feels great.	not depression
dear covid, we have not been properly introduced, although i have a feeling we wi will get to know each other soon. thanks to you, everything in my country is on lockdown. no gyms, no social events, no cinemas, ski slopes, nothing other than food stores e.t.c. and it is causing the whole population to freak out. everyone is whining and complaining about how terrible this qurantine is. everyone makes it out to sound like the world is fucking ending because they have to stay inside and can not hangout and party with friends. they make it into this huge deal and it is giving me so much anxiety because what they are describing as the end of the world is how i have been living for a significan not ti ame now. so thanks for helping me feel something at least. i know i am not in a good spot with my life, but i have felt no emotions towards changing that, i have found no reason to care. however, ever since you entered the picture people have started isolating themselvs, and explaining how terrible people are finding their current isolation, how terrible they are finding living the life i live everyday. it makes me wonder what an actual life is like, what i am missing out on, and it stresses me now why i can not find any reason to change, although i am sure it wi will fade like everything else. with everyone indirectly pointing out how horrible my life is i feel more hopeless than ever and now i just sleep all day and eat maybe once a day. apperantly i have no understanding of what life is, and i am just a hermit unaware of my life is decay, or at least to numb to do anything about it. i am sure we ll be in touch, and when you find me feel free to hit me, hard enough to where i would not get up. sincerely insensible hermit	not depression
late thoughts i wonder if any of my friends every truely liked me as much as i liked them or if i was merely tolerated before they leave me forever like i am trash on the side of the road? i do not think socialising and getting hurt is any better than just being alone, i wonder if anybody ever felt anything towards or i am just too emotional	not depression
fucking coronavirus need to get this off my chest. recently i have made a lot of efforts to be more social again after struggling with depression after breaking up contact with my unrequited love. after a long ti ame of having no motivation, no joy and no wi will to power through the day i am finally on my way to getting better. i have always hated going to school but it helped me get my mind off my problems and always put me in a social setting around my friends and recently i have even managed to connect with new people and even get to know girls from my class next door. also i have managed to get into exercising which helped me tremendously psychologically and from a health perspective. managed to lose some weight and get my bad food habits under control. this was a crucial step for me finally getting better. but now everything feels like it is slowly falling apart again. since the coronavirus outbreak started reaching my country the measures against it are slowly getting more strict and schools are closed since last week. i feel like my support net for my emotional health is being taken away. the next measure wi will be social thistancing which i am afraid of because the lack of social contact wi will put me in a dark place again for sure. the worst of all this is that we do not have a freaking clue how long this wi will last and this stresses me out the most because i am scared to death of getting back into my depression. i am freshly coming out of a three month phase which was horrible. i never had energy for anything and i really genuinely was hopeless about anything. i felt like nothing mattered to me, my friends, my hobbies everything that once was interesting to me seemed dull and boring and i just isolated myself and felt this horrible feeling in my chest, like i would i amplode anyti ame. i felt so hollow. i lived day to day and everyday was the same, everyday felt like a marathon to get through. that is why i fucking hate coronavirus. because it is effect on society wi will probably pull me back into darkness for an indefinite ti ame period. i really do not want to live in isolation for months.	not depression
i have tried so god damn hard to get better, just to put everything behind me and move on but it is so hard, i just can not do it a couple months ago i saw a old friend i havnt seen in years, he had not changed a bit, his look, his humor, his voice, and i had so much fun with them. for the first ti ame in more than a year i felt like i did not have to cut myself, like i had a reason not to die. that was a couple months ago and i can not stop thinking about it, i havnt had a human connection in so long, i am so thistant and i have no friends. i pushed all of my old friends, online friends away and i have no one. i remember thinking at one stage i was completely alone, but i had a couple friends back then i did not even think of when i was in that state of mind. but now i am turkey lonely, i have no friends, i have no one to talk to, i have anger, frustration, sadness, and so much more building up and i know it is not going to end well. i feel like if i continue going this way then i might to something bad, something i wi will regret for the rest of my life, i am already regretting so many things and it wi will just add on. i have lost nearly everything and no one cares enough to say hello to me when i walk into class, they just stare and then backchat about why i look as if i got wasted the night before, at least that is what one of them told me one ti ame. reddit does not help, you just post a post and it is just some people responding saying you have so much to live for and shit like that and i do not know why i am even doing this. no one reaches out, no one cares, no one cares about anything you do. lately i have tried to be so kind to people, people on the sidewalk, people at a mall, people online because for a while i believed that if i be nice to people maybe things wi will turn around for me, and i did that for more than a long while, and now i have come to realize it does not matter how nice i am, it does not matter how desperate i am because nothing matters, we are just cells waiting to fucking die. i have attempted it, i have gone to a bridge, i have gone to a roof and i have done so much more. and that one ti ame i was so close to doing it but i did not and i fucking hate myself for not doing it, if i ki willed myself i wouldn t be going through so much more pain, my family would cry for a little bit but that is it, no one else would care, no butterfly effect wi will happen because they wi will move on to the lives they had when i was alive, i just wish i did it because now. i do not even have the balls to jump off a roof, it is just a fall, a long fall that wi will only do good for you, yes it is selfish but its something i need, i have been nice kind generous and no one has done any of that for me, so it is ti ame i be selfish and get rid of my own problems.	not depression

my mom my mom has depression and anxiety. she always has though she and her doctor think it was only due to menopause.... although i believe it was worse during that ti ame, she has always and wi will continue to have depression and anxiety. her doctor recently suggested she could start reducing her medication since she is now through menopause and this is a horrible idea. i do not know if she has already started that or not but she is in a complete panic over this whole quarantine thing. we are taking my brothers brother in law back to his hometown from college today so it is a hour trip and she has been hysterically crying about saying that we are being stupid and she is so scared to travel. she has no underlying health concerns and we have very few cases here. but she can not pull herself together we are staying the night at my brother is house and returning home tomorrow and she is convinced we wi will get stuck at his house and never allowed to leave for a year seriously. i also have anxiety which i am medicated for and typically do very well but when she plummets like this, it is incredibly hard for me. it is going to be a looooooong hours.	not depression

you know you always hear money can not solves your problems and it is hard to believe until you can truly say that yourself i grew up extremely poor in a bad neighborhood. my mother, my two sisters and i have been through so much shit. we have been kicked out of houses by our own family members, i remember ti ames where my mother would have sex with guys just so we would have a place to stay for the night and i even seen a guy get shot and ki willed right in front me. there is so many other things that is i have been through, but when i was in my teens i met a girl and became extremely close with her family. i wouldn t say they were extremely wealthy but they had good money they took care of me and eventually adopted me, even after me and their daughter had broken up. once i stayed with them i thought that it was my ticket out i could finally be happy. her father owns a construction company and i wi will say now that i am a big part of it now. i make a good amount of money not anything major. what i am saying is i make enough to get all of things i thought would make me happy like my dream car, my own place, a dog and occasionally a girlfriend. i even someti ames financially help my real mom and family when i am able to. but i sti will feel empty inside i go weeks where i just feel like i am floating around like a shell. i fall so deep into depression that i go weeks without showering and my appetite is not existent. when i am not out faking a smile i sit in my room in complete solitude. i do not think a single thing in this world could make me happy. ive accomplished so many things they i know i should be proud of myself for but i never am. i am just lost you know and i figured if i have not found happiness now i do not think i ever wi will.	not depression

school is supposed to make us better. when i wake up in the mornings i want to cry. i always wake up with this feeling that there is a hole in my stomach and it makes me want to rip my guts out. i go to school and get graded and i always get bad grades and it constantly makes me feel like absolute worthless shit. i feel like less than shit less than dirt less than nothing. i keep getting bad grades and it makes me just want to go home and thistract myself with anything but school work and because of that i end up not doing my school work then i get thisappointed glares from teachers which makes me feel worse and then i get shit test grades and i feel even worse and everyone else talks about how easy it was and i feel worse and worse and worse and it just keeps going and i do not know what to do anymore other than give up and just get a ged when i am older. school should not make us feel this way. all my teachers say grades are not that i amportant and we should focus on our own learning but it is. if it was not like that i probably wouldn t be feeling like less than shit right now. everything is weighed on how good we do when we re only fucking teenagers. i have been diagnosed with depression and i told one of my teachers about it and she is sweet but god she made it so much worse. she treats me different now she gives me hints on tests she always looks at me with her un known pity and in the mornings says good morning to me with a voice you would use to lovingly talk to a baby or dog. i do not want to be talked to like a dog i want to be talked to and treated like a fucking equal like i am just another fucking student makes me feel worse and different and less than others. a place where we spend the majority of our days should not make us feel like crap i should not have to feel this way i am only and i can only take so much of this.	not depression

can not just be calling dead people.. we lost my dad monday. even though he had stage kidney cancer that had spread and a whole host of other issues, it came as a sudden shock. his chemo had been working. all tumors had shrank by at least . then weeks ago, he got sick. it played out like side effects from the first chemo drug he had tried. we didnt worry too much as he had an upcoming appointment. then monday, my sister texted me that he was gone text due to no service in the hospital . he was septic. his one kidney had failed completely. then, he was just gone. they also found pneumonia. well, they are being shady af with his body. they took hi am to autopsy and then to forensics. they told us it wi will be at least more days before they release his body. possibly due to not sleeping much this past week, i have started to wonder about things. his symptoms kind of match up with the corona virus. that combined with the way they are acting with his body really makes me wonder. my dad loved conspiracy theories. today on my break at work, i had a knee jerk reaction to call and tell hi am what i was thinking. but, as it turns out, you can not call dead people and tell them why you think they died. they dont answer. fucked me up a bit, and now i am just messy crying.	not depression

resources amp ideas for those struggling with the covid lockdowns and isolation hi everyone! gosh has everything gotten crazy with all these countries and places being closed down, locked down, and forbidden social contact. i have read sooooo much about people struggling and panicking about what to do now that social life has been removed. i struggle with severe depression and anxiety and just came out of a horrible episode recently only to also be shut down and isolated again by all this madness. anyway, my heart goes out to everyone struggling with this like i am. some of you are having an even worse ti ame than me, too, and i want to remind you you re not alone. here are some ideas and things all of us can try to do together to stay on top of this isolation situation, and stay away from suicide as an option. i know for a fact that these options can not cure anything and this is not a complete list!! please add your own ideas in the comments too. we can do this, guys!! . if we re isolated, hundreds of thousands of other people are too!! let us go find them!! thank god for the internet! we are not alone. let us use each other here on reddit, and or other online forums and options! stay online. keep talking. stay connected. we are not alone. . play video games. it is kind of like reading a book without the kind of mental attention that it takes to read. just go through the motions. try to lose yourself in it a little bit. and try making friends online through online multiplayer or something. dont have money? there are thousands of free ones. dont have a console? use your computer. dont have a computer? use your phone! . join another forum or online community. there are options here on reddit, and one google search of online communities wi will give you a hundred more! most of the ti ame they are completely free and many are anonymous if that is your thing. let us go meet people and talk about what is going on, and how we can all relate to being sad about being stuck inside. . instead of true video games , you can also play just si ampler games online with other people, and chat while doing it. online checkers, chess, words with friends, card games easy to learn, lots of people to meet. probably some friends here that wi will join you on one of those games or sites too! heck knows i would. invite me! anybody else have more ideas? please share! anyway, i hope this helps. we can do this, guys, its going to be okay. cue my irrational anxiety trying to tell me otherwise, and me trying to beat it away with an i amaginary broom lol 	not depression

it is been one full year of nothing but shitty expiriences and setbacks. i am tired of life exactly one year ago, i found out the person i would been with for years, was not in love anymore. shortly after that, we moved out of our house we had together. once i got my own apartment, i found alcohol and started to drink. not even a couple months afterwards, i got laid off from my job, a very good job i actually loved. eventually i drank so much i got alcohol poisoning. so i stopped drinking. then i found pi wills. i took them to numb the pain so i did not have to deal with it. it started getting so bad to the point where i came to my mini amum wage job high and putting others life in danger. so i admitted myself into a mental behavioral hospital to detox. there i was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. once out, i felt so much better. like i had a new perception of life. a couple weeks after leaving rehab, i had a major medical emergency which resulted in me having to be on bed rest for a week . i started to get really depressed being at home and stuck in bed. i felt like i could not complain because i had come so far, i did not want anyone to know i was slipping back into depression. so i started to cut, and self harm. it ended with me being cared for by my parents. they wanted me to move home so i felt more surrounded by people and safer. so i obliged. within that same ti ame period, i lost the little job i had. once home, i decided to turn to pi wills to help me sleep since it had been after moving in with no sleep. i was days sober. unfortunately, the pi wills were laced and i ended up blacking out and getting arrested and charged. not even a week later, i went and did it again. but this ti ame, my friend was the one who got arrested. now currently, its been a full year since i broke things off w the ex. i have no job, i have wrecked my car, got my license revoked. i am going through a trial right now, and worrying about dealing with court costs and lawyer fees. all the friends i have had along the way have left. because i am too much to deal with . there is nothing good that comes with me. and the rest of them left because i have tried so hard to eli aminate alcohol and drugs from my life. i have come to realize, i struggle badly with addiction as well as depression and anxiety. and life just seems to get worse and worse as the days go by. i have thought about suicide but i have brothers and sisters and a mother and father who i can not hurt that badly. it is unfair i take the easy way out when they have done so much to try and make me better. i am just tired.	not depression

boyfriend is leaving me. why do i want hi am more than ever? i have fucked up again. long story short, i have fucked up a lot.... like chances too late fucked up. i am f and he is . it always involves another person. not always bad. not ever justified. this last ti ame i responded to an ex who was supposed to be blocked. the conversation was short and we talked about nothing that would be taken wrong or bad. but i lied. i fucking lied. i do not know why. i was drunk when he brought it up and i just lied and stuck to it even though i knew he knew?!?!?! why? i even woke up the morning after he saw all of it and i knew, i told my coworker, i knew he knew. i had been so good. i really truly was happy because i thought i conquered my problems and then one message and boom! life over. family torn. future gone. anyways, i have some questions and want some thoughts... before i wi will just give some backstory on me. i have been sexually abused by a couple people close to me before. i used to be obsessed with sex. i wanted to be the best. i wanted everyone to know i was, i was proud but did not have many sexual partners. i did not have sex easily. over ti ame it got easier and i slept with a couple i regretted. well fast forward like years into my relationship and i stopped having a libido. i got on medicine for depression and anxiety about years into our relationship too late . well i got on wellbutrin to try and help this and it did for a while. then i upped it because it was not helping again. but everyti ame my boyfriend and i break up like this, i want to have sex with hi am every second of the day. but i can not..... is this because i can not have hi am? is it because of my past? what is this? if we fucked more during our relationship we probably wouldn t be here. what is wrong with me?! any suggestions or thoughts?! i am having a hard ti ame finding a therapist because i can not afford it and the last one i saw i did not like....	not depression

something beautiful i found in youtube comments and just thought you want to see it here it goes kyle broussard year ago the most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways except towards themselves. always remember this. when you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, do not take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early. just pull them aside and let them know it is alright and that we are all lost here. that is all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that does not matter, and truly connect with them even if just for a second to have a human moment. even subtle eye contact can do it. just do not let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. because they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world. depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds for to them, they are alone. cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can not connect even for a second. and all they want is to be loved. to legiti amately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. they need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves. they have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. they realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. to them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. but without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet sti will feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a tv show and a bowl of ice cream. they continually question their purpose which fuels their creative minds, but if unchecked can lead to self ruin. maybe find some ti ame in between checking your phone for notifications about sports and watching drama shows on your tv to give them a call and say you love them. it might just be what keeps them on this planet. taken from mac mi willer conversation pt. https www.youtube.com watch?v ycxhpghwvi sorry, on mobile i just thought i can brighten up someone is day as it did mine, be strong yall.	not depression

i do not have depression. but i need advice, i tried to post in so many sub reddits but it keeps deleting hey, i am in a year old female th grade , and right now i am in a low point in my life no i am not one of those i am andthisisdeep girls haha . at the moment i really do not want to thiscuss everything yet, but there is this one situation i do. also please mind that i am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive. i wi will try to list everything... my friend group consists of around people i think, it keeps adding up, and i wi will explain later . there is this girl in my friend group can not really say friends because i am not really close to them who keeps avoiding me. she started to avoid me around the start of the school year. she started show her thislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, i can not recall properly, sorry that if they were not going to receive any flowers in valentines day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. i was curious, so i asked something related to it sorry, can not remember exactly , i think i said something like oh! what movie? or when? like when would this event take place . she then rudely replies with who are you!? . this other girl from my friend group just stared at me not in a rude way, but in a way i can not read her expression i was kind of hurt then. this behaviour kept continuing. around a few days later, i went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently thislikes me. she i ammediately stood up and rushed no kidding, she ran away from me to the opposite side, and sat there. i just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. the group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said oh, i know why . because of this, i was in a shit mood. the shittiest mood i have been compared to the whole day. i was walking to my hsie class where of my other friends were in . i asked one of them, for her privacy, i wi will call her sally why let us call her fiona keeps avoiding me. sally replies saying i said something to fiona a few months ago that pissed her off. sally then tells me to not worry, and that fiona is a petty person . honestly, i thought okay, wtf? i actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though ti ameskip to a few days, with fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle as always! !, and with me now, i try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away . i asked someone who was friends close to fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. i explained the situation to her whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that yandere girl from yandere si amulator because i am awkward af, seriously . she also responds to something si amilar. she said fiano used to act up like that to her and i just need to get used to it. i was tearing up again not to the extend to cry le fucking sigh . she then adds oh, you do not like it? . she then says something si amilar that sally said before she is just petty ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone . ti ameskip she keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. recently i was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, fiona responds hey name and ignores me wow, how nice... . when i talk, she glares at me. and more, more, more negative reactions to me. today, i had hsie class after lunch. i was complaining not in an annoying way about how boring it was. and then fucking piano responds with maybe if you had friends . i pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. i had just enough with her play and said something around maybe i should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely? why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, i wi will say sorry and blah blah blah. sorry, i only started to notice i was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who thislike me. i would not talk about it because this thread would be wayyy too long . fiona then replies with nothing no you did nothing wrong. i just hate you. . i was spreading in a bad mood. bad morning, had a maths test, did not sleep because i was staying up studying and also extremely very stressed! the group went silent, stopped talking. i had enough, i do not want to be apart of the group explain later . i do not want to be near her. i. fucking.had.enough. i abruptly left the group sorry, should have mentioned earlier, but i do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me and walked around, staring at happy i mean i do not really know people with their friends, fake smiling. ugh for some reason i approached some closely just to stare at them. ugh fucking amazing life. also i wi will talk about my friends now. they weren t a fixed group, especially around th grade. you know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just force put them in your group? well, welcome to mine! anyways, my group is basically where new people come. there has been from th grade never met her before and an old friend who came back left . there would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one that one more now . this year, th grade, already on our th week, girls were introduced i do not even remember their names . there are certain things that creates a friend group. for example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms the bookworm group . because of this tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends , my friends group is not so closely connected to one another. like lunch is so fucking boring now. when was the last ti ame i had fun during recess or lunch? note out of days i have school meetings on lunch, just src things! now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. no little interactions created. i am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now i am. when they talk, they laugh, i do not. but seriously, i never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am i? at home. they had photos posted on instagram one ti ame of them in a party. they tagged each other, not including me only one, thanks. btw not close to her though . they printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory some are on their phone case . one picture was the korean hand heart that saranghaeyo thingy they made together as a circle. wow, like that did not t hurt i am not close to them, i feel lonely being around them, and i have no one to talk to, no one to trust. where do i go now? how do i make friends? because of this, i have reached out bout my loneliness online in a few different platforms to talk to. it is nicer to talk to someone online though.. they do not know me and keep this secret... sorry, this was longer than i thought. there is more i want to talk about i never thought something that i thought was small would end up being this long . i may post some more in the future. if there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! but i would not respond if it is too personal hehe . i need someone to talk to...	not depression

on my mind so after ages i finally asked my crush and one of my best friends out on a date. and she said yes. this made me the fking happiest i have bin in forever. after months of dating i realized that we were taking it very slowly. i thought it was fine, good things need their ti ame to blossom. after another months i realized that i was suffering under these circumstances and that it was really hard for me not knowing if she sti will liked me back. yes we kissed and yes she initiated it once but two weeks ago this happened after one of the best nights i ever had, we were talking in the car and i just asked if everything was alright with us . after a moment of silence i dreaded her answer and then she startet trying to say something. she tried and tied again and again until she finally said i am in love with someone else... and the thing is it is not another male. this has been really hard on me. i do not think she is a lesbian but i, felt how insecure she was about her own sexuallity and that she was sooo afraid that people would not accept her anymore. now i am stuck in a wierd af situation. i sti will really love her and i feel like giving up on us isnt even an option. she has been one of my best friend in ages and i dont want to loose her. but i dont know if its healthy for me if we keep on seeing each other or hanging out. i mean ive been kinda depressed for a while now, the bad feelings and thought come and go. i am also worried that if i thistance myself from her that it would intensify her insecurites. if she were in love with another guy i would probalby stop seeing her tho, wouldn t i? or at least i should, should not i? this shit has been really hard on me. i mean seriously i think about her all the ti ame. everything reminds me of the awsome ti ames we had and now i can not even watch lebian pron without being blue. thanks for reading...	not depression

i can not keep this up. the fight has left me. i really do not have the strength to keep pushing through every day. if it weren t for my wife and parents i would have checked out long ago. i can not do that to them. i also can not keep on like this. the mask is starting to crack. i have no lack for support or professional help. i take my meds. i go to therapy. i look after myself physically. i am doing the right things, yet nearly every minute of every day i just want to die. i do not know what to do anymore. i am basically waiting for the clock to run out. that is years away. holy hell is that thought terrifying. this feels like prison with no chance of parole.	not depression
i can not stop making things worse since this year started i feel like all i do is keep screwing up, i thought i could make life better compared to last year, but instead i have f cked it up more and want nothing but either the end or to just get away from this town, this city, everything and everyone. i have nothing anymore, and i have no one. i would rather be dead than feeling at this point.	not depression

nobody bothers anymore. ti ame for me to do the same. i am tired. i never post anything myself, but i have frequented in comments a lot. i am tired of responding in any way only to find myself backhanded for other people. it is like i am a freak or the plague avoided so frequently, someti ames in a row. i have asked myself, did i respond incorrectly? did i say something wrong in all that? maybe the way i wrote something ended up being confusing or easy to take the wrong way? am i just not enough? i realized that anyti ame i have messaged anyone, i was the one initiating it all i was the one to message first, i was the one to reach out to another. i never got that treatment myself nobody saw something of me and went out of their way to message me, let alone to extend a hand, to reach out just to check up. even when i see something about unloading and talking about everyone is day, i do that, and then see all sorts of people getting responses. i do not. that kinda stuff stings first it makes you question, then it feeds your already ancient loneliness, then it seeps into your depression that you have always had, and then, it just assures the fact that you do not matter neither to anyone, nor in the grand scheme of things. if i do not start things, i might as well be inexistent. hell, even if i do, chances are, it is a whole lotta nada. and i am tired of it. i am done trying.	not depression
i think i need to leave my partner of years my girlfriend and i have been together for ten years and i do not know what to do anymore. she suffers from depression, anxiety and severe ocd. over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it is just too much for me, we do not see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i have ended up having to cancel plans. it is our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she does not want go. fair enough, but i have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself. she is not from here so has no family or friends here who are not mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but i am exhausted. i can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she does not want me to tell anyone. she believes she is just in the way and makes everyone is life shit, i try and tell her it is not true but it is so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she would be better off dead, she is threatened suicide before so i feel like if i leave her even for this weekend she would ki will herself as it is not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she is better off dead. idk anymore, i really do not. i do not even know if this is just kme being an asshole i am just lost and confused and tired. i sti will love her but she just does not care about life anymore. she stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, i respected her wishes and tbh, someti ames it seemed fine but lately it is absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication. idk please help, should i leave? i am so worried about her but also worried about myself and just feel sick.	not depression
letter from my girlfriend amp x b my girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... letter to my depressed lover. i see you. i know you re in there. the man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt deserving of happiness. he is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. at ti ames it feels like there is no hope, at ti ames it feels like there is no escape. you are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you ll ever be strong enough to fight this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. wi will you ever be able to feel the sun stroking your skin again? wi will you ever see the light again? wi will you ever feel love again? why are you here? how did you get here? you never asked for this, no one would. a tyrant is an i willegiti amate ruler who controls through oppression. tyranny is not fair, it is not understanding, and it is cruel. the tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but to succumb, he wi will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no longer a threat to hi am. the tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too mighty to outthink, too present to escape. but let me tell you something about tyrants. anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain. behind every tyrant is a hurt child. behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. the tyrant does not want you to see the light, because the light was once taken from hi am, he does not want you to know love, because love was once taken from hi am, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts. but how can tyranny be defeated? when tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves the way for another form of tyranny. you do not want to ki will your tyrant, you ll be left with blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you ki will you ll have to hide, and what is the point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of darkness? no. your tyrant would not be defeated by force. he wi will be defeated by love, and i know that your love is strong enough to turn hi am around. the man that i love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. the man that i love is surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. the man that i love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around hi am feel seen, heard, and loved. the man that i love is wise, he can offer advice that you never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone is day. the man that i love wi will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and attention. the man that i love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that he can make anyone is darkness fade away. so, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down, it wi will be the man that i love. love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make hi am feel comfortable enough to talk, comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led hi am to tyranny. when faced with love, with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your tyrant wi will be able to start facing up to his actions, he wi will be able to start realising that all along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. when that realisation wi will spring upon hi am, he wi will remove your blindfold and you wi will see that you are facing yourself. but do not worry, it is just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he would not wish to do that anymore though, he wi will unchain you and remove his mask, and you wi will realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. suddenly the anger you felt towards your tyrant wi will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who does not believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. you are a man who can recognise when a child si amply needs to be held, loved and nurtured. so you wi will take the child is hand. at first, he wi will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who s to say that you would not hurt hi am? but you wi will give hi am your word, you wi will promise hi am that he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you wi will know that you are telling the truth. the child wi will weep in your arms, and you wi will hold hi am tighter, you wi will tell hi am that he is loved, he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he wi will never be alone. you wi will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. and although at first it wi will feel like a relief, it would not be easy. you have not seen the sun in so long, its light wi will feel blinding and uncomfortable, your body wi will sti will feel weak, and as you ll barely feel able to look after yourself, you ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? but you wi will surprise yourself. through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the cool grass underneath your feet, you wi will find strength. enough strength to lift yourself up, carry the child, and start walking. it wi will be challenging, and you ll worry that each step might be your last step, you ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get back up, but you ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural. eventually you ll look up and realise that the sun is not as blinding as it was when you first came out, you ll see a path, and you ll know how to get home. on your way home, you wi will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a burden for me. what if i do not want hi am? what if i do not love hi am? after all he was once a tyrant, how could i love hi am? and what if i do not even love you anymore? you have been gone for so long, what if i have stopped waiting? what if i have given up? what if i have found someone else? what if i just end up hurting you and the child more than you have both already been hurt? but all this ti ame, i have been waiting for you. i have been worrying, i have been crying, you thisappeared so suddenly i never understood what had happened. i made it my mission to find you, i was up day and night trying to save you, i called on you a thousand ti ames, i searched for clues in every corner, i even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail, it only angered hi am more. i tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, i was left weakened. that is when i realised that i was exhausting myself, and i was not helping you. so i did the only thing i could do. i stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be able to save yourself, and as i waited for you to do that, i held our space, i nourished our space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could one day feel whole again and heal. when you come home, i wi will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love hi am, just as i learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. the truth is i already know your little boy, i have seen hi am in your shadows, and i have already grown to love hi am. you also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship. she has loved you as much as i have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. when you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never come back, she worried that perhaps you did not want to come back to us, perhaps you wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us. but i reassured her, and i told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we spent looking into each other is eyes, as ti ame stood sti will and the world around us vanished, and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. our love is the truest love i have ever known, our love is the deepest love i have ever known, and i know that a love like ours, never just goes away. one day my little girl wi will meet your little boy, and they wi will love each other as much as we love each other, the four of us wi will build a home so whole, that all our fears wi will be replaced by trust, our anger wi will be replaced by love, and tyranny wi will be nothing but a thistant memory. this is not going to happen overnight, we do not want you to exhaust yourself trying to come home, we do not want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so that you can slowly but surely come back to us. if i could, i would be in the basement with you, but you do not want me there, and if i force myself into the basement, my little girl wi will turn into a tyrant again and our home wi will collapse. so although i am not in the darkness with you, know that i can sti will see you, and i am sti will here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant unconditionally, so that you can bring hi am home for us to nurture and heal hi am, so that he can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.	not depression

feeling suicidal after reading a pedophilic romance manga hi all, i am years old and are working as software engineer.. on the last days, i just got emotionally triggerred just by reading a manga that potrays loneliness and pedophilic romantic relationships.. i know it sounds so exaggereative and or trashy, but i didnt expect that manga would push my buttons deep inside, so hard that i would just weep uncontrollably and are having suicidal thoughts due to the tragic content of the manga.. was i emotionally triggered because of it resonates deep within my subconscious? or is it just because i long such relationship potrayed in it as a pedophile? or both? the last days i wasnt able to function properly at work.. any idea to shake it off my head?	not depression

dae hate washing themselves? i do not seem to relate to anyone on this planet at all. people like cleaning themselves, but why? i do not feel dirty or anything and my last shower was a month ago. why is it gross if i never leave my own room or see anyone, and do not feel gross? when i do, i shower. but i just never do. its boring like everything else in the world and i would much rather sit here and browse youtube, netflix, reddit and drink myself to death. btw this is not a complaint or anything, i just wish i was like other people, that actually want to wash. my mindset is that i do not want to change, i just do not understand why other people are not like me. for me the only enjoyable thing to actively do is my laptop, nothing else matters.	not depression

desolation depression is writing sick poetry on skin and publishing it with scars, cutting on ankles, not wrists because you re scared you ll get in trouble but you so desperately need to be seen, and never are. depression is writing the word alone and seeing the word home , accepting the pain like a gift because you deserve it. depression is admitting suicidal thoughts to paper and not to people, and loving the broken things, hoping to tie them together, thinking maybe things wi will get better, but knowing that is just wishful thinking.	not depression

my job was a source of my depression now that i do not work for them, i can talk about them heavily working for spectrum was a nightmare because of a kiss ass director, a dumbass senior director, and a bitch ass manager. when i first started there, the focus was on being a customer facing network operations center. what does that mean? if you were a customer who called in, you would be talking to an engineer who could make any neccessary change that was needed to get your service back up and running or to tell you why it was down if the issue was outside of spectrum is control. the sr. director, however, wanted our department to be a call center. what is the difference? a call center is about taking as many calls as possible, not about really resolving the issue a basic ticket creating center. if you re paying dollars per month or more, you should not be subjected to taking a ticket and waiting in line. spectrum does not see it that way. spectrum only really cares of you re paying six figures or more. everyone else is expendable. it was utter garbage. it is utter garbage! i left my previous job because i could not take the call center crap. my concern was fixing the issue at hand. i did not care for small talk, for hearing people vent, for call metrics, etc. fixing the issue was my concern! i, also, did not care for dealing with customers who were stupid. an example my internet is not working. troubleshooting for min. i am not seeing an issue. well, i keep getting a message that says that the website is down due to issues with the server. that is not a spectrum issue if you can not get to your bank is website. but you re our server! your bank is server is down. can not you change the traffic is route to get to their server? that is not how this works. i want a manger! stuff like this was common. the manager i was assigned to said stuff like, did you do everything to resolve the customer is concern? i am aware that it was not a spectrum issue but is not there something else that you could have done to fix the issue? did you explain it to them carefully so that they understood? he actually told me, it is not my job to read your tickets. if a customer is upset, i have to help the customer. he said this to me after i told hi am and proved to hi am that an issue was the customer is fault as their firewall for this issue was blocking their traffic, not spectrum. to mention the kiss ass director, he is in charge of a department that he has no knowledge in. he could not tell a layer issue from a three layer cake. no certification or knowledge for the department he is over. he would transfer residential issues to our team because a customer complained. the business department can not touch residential accounts at all. he did not look at anything or know anything. he never fought for the department. he, actually, tried to get more responsibility added to the department that would cause calls to last even longer and fewer issues to get resolved! he agreed to removing access to tools needed to help fix issues! all so his bosses could see that he does whatever they tell hi am to. i hope that, if you re reading this, you avoid spectrum. they wi will lie to you in a heartbeat of it wi will get you to spend money.	not depression

medication works!!! i have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and i have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. it really helps! a little background i got out of a year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in december . and then one person who i thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. i get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression which eventually led to insomnia, ibs, migraines and constant body aches. i started therapy in feb and have been since going to my therapist every week. and my therapist suggested i look at options for medication and try it. so since the last weeks, i am on lexapro ssri and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. but for the last days i have been observing that my energy levels have increased because i have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. my ibs has decreased and i have not got any migraines. i am really really glad the medication is helping. if anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it. i am sure if it working and it wi will help.	not depression

hi ive been really depressed lately... my math subject at school failed, i keep thinking i wi will not graduate, i have no energy to go to school anymore so i fake everything and go to a nearby computer cafe even though i only have enough money to commute to my school. i know lifes hard but theres something in my brain that broke... i am not crazy though just uncaring. but i noticed i suddenly grew an interest on one of our kitchen knives, not like to hurt people, its just an odd interest where you i amagine the knife ki willing you painlessly. but the thing is, i have a phobia of sharp things so i grew up cautious with sharp objects including knives... its not really bad, i just do stabbing motions on myself, but the point is i consider doing that normal. i also keep daydreaming while walking and oddly enough i daydream about me getting in a car crash or something si amilar, which i has a high chance of happening considering i am daydreaming. another point is my fake laughter, i dont know why i keep doing it. i know i am probably mentally i will but i have no why of knowing since psychiatrists and therapists costs very much in my country. anyway i am just rambling about my problems but i have a feeling itll all end soon. just a feeling...	not depression
ranting and also maybe advice ? i met this girl month ago and i feel in love very quick. she is from portugal and i am from slovenia.. and we thought about having a long thistance but she feels like its not going to work. we talked about it days ago and i told her i can not be there just friends because i am only making myself suffer, she seems to have no problem with it, but i just can not get over myself and watching somebody drift away while i wait. it hurts so much and the things she said about me how amazing i am and how bad she wants me to stay there, but i just can not i am falling into depression again. i told her i am going to stay but i dont know if i am capable i am just hurting myself. years of this and just when you think you get out of it it crawls back so fast ahhhhh. and i feel like the most egoistical, needy piece of shit that i can not get over the fact its over. fuck this shit and fuck life. thanks for listening 	not depression
coming off antidepressants? i have been on sertraline zoloft for a couple months. i felt like it was really doing something for me, but i have been without it for a couple weeks now, because my parents kinda suck and i can not pick up my own prescription, and i feel horrible. like, the absolute lowest i have ever felt and i do not know if that is normal when you stop taking your meds. i do not really know what to do, i felt like i started to be able to actually function like a regular person, and now i am back in my hole.	not depression

my mom just gave up on me since i was young, my mom was the only person who took care of me because my dad left when i was a baby. however, during the summer before freshman year, my parents agreed to move in together and share an apartment so that i could have both of my parents. my dad made a clear that he changed for the better and he was not going to be a deadbeat anymore. this arrangement only lasted for about a year and a half, however, because my dad recently moved out two weeks ago. my dad leaving again hurt a lot because i felt like i did not build enough of a relationship with hi am. i never really got to the point where i could tell hi am personal stuff, especially how i feel about hi am and his decision to leave again. it is just been adding on stress and anxiety. yesterday, the straw that broke the camels back erupted at school, and i ended up in a violent altercation with another student. i pushed hi am into the wall, and his head started to bleed. a lot. i i ammediately went to apologize, and he said there was no hard feelings. i was suspended for five days, and my mom was furious after she found out. over the last two days, she is been repeatedly telling me that she is given up on me and my dreams. she says the only place i wi will ever end up is prison, and i wi will never be shit. so now she is giving me to my dad because she just can not handle me anymore and all i do is make her suffer.	not depression
i am not even worthy of being counted during attendance. i go to a small school, normally no more than students are in a classroom, yet my teachers do not even realize i am in their class most of the ti ame. i have amazing teachers, and they always want to help students learn, but i am always forgotten about. i am not slow enough to need special help, i am not smart enough to need no help though. i am pretty quiet, and i almost always get interrupted by loud people. if i actually work up the nerve to ask a question in my asshole fi willed classes, the teacher gets thistracted by two idiots trying to ki will each other and forgets about me. i know i probably sound like a spoiled child that just wants attention, but i do not. all i want is to not be forgotten, to not be interrupted, to not be counted absent in a class when i am always there.	not depression

my relationship with instagram. my relationship with instagram is complicated. while i do see it as a good way to promote certain things like my amateur photography for example, i also feel like it is repetitive to an extent. i feel like whenever i go on there, it is mostly the same old kinds of posts. gym selfies, selfies in general, people who brag about their rich lifestyles, the list goes on and on. witnessing those kinds of posts over and over just am not good for my social anxiety and depression. does anyone else feel the same way?	not depression

to all of those feeling isolated and suffering right now... i have learned that life is fucking sad someti ames. you start to think that maybe things are not going to get better at all. i have been at points which i think, it can not get worse than this, but then i thiscover a new section of rock bottom, thinking, ah this is it! i assure you, there is always something worse than what you re going through. it can get worse. per that same logic, there is always the chance it gets better. i think i hold onto that and you should too. you might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. they come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. you have your back, and that is what matters at the end of the day. keeping this in mind, take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. we humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. it saved me, at least. i am sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to i amprove it. at this point, things can either i amprove or worsen, and the amazing this is that you have the choice.	not depression
choosing not to see you this ti ame it hurts..but i remembered the feelings i had last ti ame i went and saw you. it hurt..i cried myself to sleep. i went to bed hurting and i woke up hurting. once again i am left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. i crossed many busy roads and cli ambed many tall mountains to just try and please you and i sti will believe you truly do not care. it is hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. looking back at when i had you i looked so different. i literally had a glow within me. you gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. i have never been the same since then. i am not sure why i have kept you around for more years after we broke up. i know deep down you wi will never be able to make me shine like you used to..i wi will never have that glow again. i wi will never be able to feel that love again..and it si ample as to why not..because you do not love me..you do not care about me..it is funny how life works. how the people you would do anything for in this world wi will do nothing for you. how the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. when wi will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..hopefully soon..but for now as i wait i have decided to not cross any busy roads for you or cli amb any mountains..for now i wi will stay here even though it hurts i am safer here by myself than with you.	not depression

what a real friend is so right after i posted an hour ago something big happened. i was walking around thinking about my dog and i wi will do so much fun stuff with hi am. as i was walking i was so deep in my thoughts i did not realize where i was going and bumped into someone. for the life of me, i bumped into the biggest jackass in my school. for privacy reasons, we ll call hi am earl. earl loved to be a complete asshole to me. he tells me to watch where i am going and called me a dumbass. the thing about earl is he is easily pissed off if i act smart with hi am so i did exactly that because my day has been absolute hell. i am not the greatest at comebacks so i said what anyone who wouldn t know what to say. no u. he got so pissed that he shoved me on the ground with the force of a bull. i hit my head pretty hard on the ground but i was able to get back up without hesitation. i have hit my head so many ti ames it does not affect me that much. one of my friends, for privacy reasons we ll call hi am ernie. ernie noticed some red liquid in my hair. i was bleeding from my head. by this point, there was a huge ass circle between earl, ernie, and i. earl swung at me and hit me dead center in my stomach. i fell to the ground gasping for air. earl knocked the air out of me. now i know what you re thinking, wouldn t the school have stopped this by now? no. i go to a ghetto school where none of the adults care about what the kids do and that includes fights. i was gasping for air trying to breathe. while i was on the ground gasping for air i called earl a son of a bitch. earl was about to charge me while i was on the ground but ernie knew he had to jump in or something terrible was going to happen. ernie jumps in and tackles earl to the ground. ernie was on top so he began to punch earl in the face repeatedly. kids were yelling and everything. it got to a point where earl is face was all bloody. finally, a teacher came out because someone told them what was going on. they separated ernie and earl with security guards holding the both of them. the three of us were brought to the office. i had to leave school and go to the hospital so i could get stitches. i do not know what ernie and earl are currently at right now. i am just glad that ernie jumped in to help me. if he did not my injures would be a lot worse.	not depression

feel like i am failing those around me and my boyfriend by how much i do not lean on them. hey, so i am a year old guy. currently on study aboard for a year in france. i am on here because i really do not know what to do. i realized after being alone in another place some things about myself. that i have never had a person to depend on, even feeling that i have to take care of my own mother and all my friends. i recently got a bf before i left for france back home. i feel as if by how independent i have learned how to be i am not allowing myself to be with hi am fully and to fully allow myself to be happy. this goes also with i do not allow myself to do things that make me happy as usually those things are not productive and then do not mean anything to me. this caused me to not really know what to do as a hobby to make myself be happy. i am not to sure what to ask but any advise.	not depression

trapped in a worlld constructed my my mind. english is not my first language. so some of the things that characterizes me i believe are depression, sensitivity, sluggish cognitive tempo sct , social anxiety and asd have diagnosis . i have convinced myself that my version of reality is warped and greatly li amited compared to the average person. dunno, maybe i am just being delusional. i have completely abandoned my ego because possessing one takes me to a place i like to call the abyss. this basically gives me ignorant suffering. okay, i wi will try to explain this the best i can. several regions of my brain appear to be inactive and it is always been like this since i have been born. due to this and the things i have listed before, without sufficient self awareness life can become quite miserable without me realizing it. i reject my experience of reality and started considering the possibility of everyone else being soulless except me. the perfect coping mechanism! i can not validate my version of the world or other people is existences. even as i read your comments, it wi will literally turn into a feedback loop to be interpreted by my brain. so i pay close attention to my thoughts, feelings, inclinations, ambitions, point of view, emotions and basically reject them. i have this constant need for sti amulation think i may have inattentive adhd , otherwise i get bored, completely empty and start feeling really . though denying the very core essence of my being requires so much brainpower due to things listed above, and due to poor memory, i start doubting my belief. all i want to do is turn into a recluse and live a life of self indulgence completely cutting myself off of society for good. a problem that i often have is falling victi am to the flow of others like a toddler . have i lost a part of my psyche? i do not know what to believe, when to feel guility, when to feel happy, when to feel sad, what to consider an accomplishment. the world i know has been created thorugh the perspective of my mind. something i deeply hate , and thus i am a forsaken existence. i can not communicate with the outside world due to the feedback loop thingy do not know how to interpret reality . although, i do not feel completly alone because i believe in god.	not depression

what should i do about my parents? tbh, although i did not have the greatest relationship with my parents, i did think that they actually cared about me. well, not until the day they got to know that i am suicidal. they started yelling at me, and saying that i am blackmailing them cus that would only bring them problems with the police... and then they told me that after i turn i wi will be able to do whatever i wi will want which probably means... eh, is this even understandable? we had to go to some specialist but they called it off for the same reason, saying i would probably tell the doctor something bad about them . also, this all obviously got me lose my control, panic and cry as hell, but all support i got was shut up already ...	not depression

how i overcome and cope with my depression everyday hope this helps you guys too this is my first post and i do not know if anyone wi will care to read this but i am going to post it anyways. i have had clinical depression for the past couple years now and i think everyone can relate the the feeling of hopelessness. thinking if things were like this i would feel better . if only..... . i would be so much happier if .... . but you end up thinking yourself in hole of sadness and feeling like there is nothing you can do to fix it and the cycle repeats and nothing changes. this is how i mainly experience my depression. and lately i have been making changes in my life that is been helping me and i hope this can help someone of you find a way to not get rid of your depression, but cope with it and find a way to tackle it everyday. warning this is what i do personally to help me. i am not saying this is the right way for everyone but i encourage you to try some of the ways i handle day to day life. most i amportant of all get out of bed. just get out. say to yourself , , , and stand up on . there is something you can be doing besides laying in bed. i have to tell myself everyday no matter how much i want to sit in bed and do nothing and just sleep and not think about my problems, i know i can not because i would not be happy that way. there is something you could be doing to make your day seem productive and like you got something accomplished for that day. do laundry. go for a run. clean the thishes. read a book. do that one thing you have been putting off but would not even take that long to do. the high you can get from having a fulfi willing day feeling like you have been productive and done something is incomparable to anything i have ever experienced talk to someone. no matter how much you want to be reclusive and just keep to yourself i can not express how i amportant having social bonds and commuting with others is. i do not care if you do not have friends, most of us really do not. literally talk to your coworker. strike up a convo with someone in the grocery line waiting to checkout. hell have a conversation with your uber driver. communication and expressing thoughts are such an i amportant part of mental health and talking to people always makes me feel like none of us are truly alone in this world, we are all part of a collective group just trying to get through together. remind yourself everyday that you are worthy. this is the hardest thing i struggle with. when good things happen to me instead of feeling happy i feel sad. i do not deserve this i am not suppose to feel happy i am not worthy of this . you are worthy. you are worthy of living. you are worthy of love. you are worthy of attention. you re not the useless piece of shit you think you are. we all deserve happiness. this is essential to live a fulfi willing life. i can not stress this enough all of this is easier said that done and i realize that. i know because it took me forever to start doing these things after i realize what was truly making me depressed. i hope some of you though found inspiration in this and try some of these out. thank you 	not depression

i do not want to work get a job but i am a burden if i am unemployed i am and living at home with my mom, not going to school though i wi will be in the fall and i have got medical debt, student loans to pay, etc. honestly never thought i would live this long, i planned to ki will myself before i got to my s. i feel pathetic for not wanting a job, and i know i just add to my moms stress. i worry i am ruining her new marriage by being a drain on her and her new husband. neither of them make a lot of money, and i am just mooching off of them by living in their house and using their utilities. i have not been able to pay them rent this month, and two bi wills just came in the mail for me. my mom always says to get a job but i do not think i can. i do not even want to, and that makes me feel worse. i have had jobs since i was . i have worked retail, food service, janitorial, babysitting, pet sitting, and hated all of it. working a job is unbearable to me. my last suicide attempt was because i could not stand the thought of continuing to work until i am old and decrepit. it is like torture to me. like wearing a corset and standing perfectly sti will for hours on end while people spit on and insult me. i am not normal, and it takes an incredible amount of effort for me to pass as normal for that long. i do not like talking to new people, and i absolutely hate bosses managers etc. i hate the whole damn system, the idea that i have to be profitable to some idiot who thinks i am scum in order to earn the right to live off of top ramen and cereal. i have tried my hand at being a freelance artist, but no luck. the results are not coming fast enough and the debt is piling up. i would rather off myself than get another mini amum wage job, but as my mom loves to remind me, dying is expensive. thanks if you read, hope anyone else out there is doing better.	not depression

birthday depression? yoooo guys, so today is my th birthday. i have this feeling of underwhelming thisappointment, like i have not achieved enough by now and that today is not what it should be. i spent the day inside i live in nyc and coronavirus is on the rise and only went out twice to walk my dogs. i worked from home, editing a video project i did not enjoy until i wanted to cry with frustrating from revisions and worked on my own youtube channel which i like most but really did not do much i enjoyed. my boyfriend is obsessed with following the fast spread of coronavirus. he took me out to dinner last night and kept saying things jokingly like this might be your last and its funny but also just all very depressing. i am also on my period with cramps love that and feeling ugly and like crap. anyway, i am not sure what i am expecting to gain from this post but i was wondering if this is normal.. it is already pm here and raining outside but if anyone has ideas on things i could do to feel better, i would love to know. thanks.	not depression

can i tell my depressed friend that she has let me down? my best friend of over years has been depressed for most of our friendship. it came to a head when she got pregnant years ago and had to come off her meds unexpectedly. it was a very low and dark ti ame for her, and she would scream and cry, run away and throw things at us, but we just grabbed her and held tight. she came through, credits us me and our other best friend with her recovery. she praises us for saving her life and always being there for her. but she does not maintain her mental health once she is better . she hates that she has to put any effort into it, because she does not have ti ame and she is too tired. all she does is work, look after her child and watch tv in between. she stopped seeing other friends, blaming them for abandoning her, but in reality, she became very difficult to be friends with. it is now at a point that i need her i am getting married but she is decided that she can not attend as she is pregnant again. she only talks about herself and does not respond to anything i say about my life or when i ask for advice. there is no conversation anymore. essentially, she is so sick that she can not see or think of anyone but herself and now i just feel totally let down. should i tell her? or just try and move passed the fact that i should not have expected support from someone who can not help themselves?	not depression
how did it get this bad? ever since my daughter died all my friends have abandoned me. i can not talk about how i feel to anyone any more and have to look strong for those around me. my wife, my other daughter, my co workers. how did it get to the point that i trust nobody anymore?	not depression

awareness of depression ram dass has a bri williant way of putting things into perspective. one thing in particular he said about depression really made me change my point of view of my depression and anxiety. he explains how we can seperate ourselves from our self identification of the depression. a short part of one of his talks goes something like this person a i am really deeply depressed. person b are you noticing your depression? person a the noticer is just noticing. person b is the noticer depressed? person a well no, it is just noticing. the lesson is to cli amb into the noticer more and more. reduce your self identification with the depression.	not depression
only one way out... so i am a nursing student who just got placed at a pediatric mental health institute and honestly it scares the shit outta me. there are year olds that are taking medications for depression and even year olds that want to ki will themselves. i wonder how these kids havent even started life and they are already hating it. it honestly sucks. tbh i went through a period of ti ame where i was depressed as well but its scary to even think what these children have went through or are going through that brought them to this horrendous place. i hate calling the sadness that i went through depression because that word just triggers me to think of everything that is wrong with me. i coped through my sad ti ames by turning to religion but i know not everyone is like me. i dont even know how to help these kids and i dont think stuffing them with drugs prescribed by the doctor wi will ever help. it hurts me everyday to see them because i wish i had the power to rewire their brains and make them see the goodness in life. life is a constant struggle and is not a place i like either, but that doesnt mean you should just quit. you need to keep going. you need to find one thing and try to get to it. just one goal. it is hard when you wake up and you dont even want to get up, just starting your day by wishing you died in your sleep, but trust me, one day you wi will like something about life. and you wi will die in the end which may make it seem like you are just living for no end goal or purpose, but i believe i am not working for this world but the afterlife, and even if you dont believe in this, just try to make it your goal to make others lives better and make others happy before you die. no amount of money wi will ever make you happy if your not happy with yourself. so push yourself and cry and keep going. sacrifice yourself for others and dont expect nothing in return. the smile you give to others by tearing yourself apart wi will give you comfort, and hopefully make you smile one day. and if it doesnt...i might come visit you and make you smile 	not depression

hope that is what i felt when i thought about you. hope for the future, because i knew no matter what, i would have you by my side. we were damn near perfect for each other, and i loved you more than anything. the day i met you, i knew i was going to fall for you. how could i stop myself? you were beautiful. your perfect smile, curly brown hair, and those eyes that seemed to look right into my soul, it was all so intoxicating. life was beyond perfect and i spent my days with you on my mind. when my da died, you were there. you held me when i cried, you were perfect. when i left for the funeral, that is when things changed. i began to fall apart. i came back to school, and i spent every minute of the day with you. i was depressed and you made me feel better. i was failing all my classes, but i did not care because i would rather be with you. then, you left. you moved out, you lied to me about why. i met your mother, although you were rather weird about it. you drove off without kissing me, which threw me off. i got to see you the next day, meet your friends. i loved spending ti ame with you, being part of your life, and i loved your friends. i was excited to be around this more. when i totaled my car, that was the last ti ame i meant anything to you. you had taken everything i had to give, and other than sex i was worthless. when we talked on the phone it felt forced, and i was scared i was going to lose you. when january came around, i was excited. i was doing well in school, and your birthday was coming up. i had a surprise for you. you thought you were just staying the night with me, but i was going to take you skiing, because you had never seen snow before. but the night before, you barely talked to me. i tried to call you, but you brushed me off. i barely slept that night, i was so excited to get to spend ti ame with you. but when i woke up, you had not left. an hour rolled around, then two, and i called you. straight to voicemail. i texted you, and you did not respond. around noon you finally woke up. that is when it began to end. you told me you had tried to ki will yourself the night before. i was so shocked, but i did not let it bother me. i comforted you and asked you what you wanted me to do. the next day, i borrowed my roommates car and drove to the hospital to see you. i wanted to surprise you. i had your christmas presents, which you insisted you did not want. i texted your sister and asked her what room you were in, and she asked what i meant. i asked if you had gotten out of the hospital and she said you were never in the hospital. that is when i saw it. you had slipped up, and your friend had put a post on instagram. you with your boyfriend. only it was not me. it never was me. from the beginning, you had been lying. i called you and i asked one thing. why? why would you do this to me? i wish you would have reacted any other way. you started crying. you told me how sorry you were. i asked if your sister knew, and that is when i found out. you had been lying to everyone. i wanted so badly to tell everyone, but i did not. i wondered what else you had been lying about so i asked your sister, and i found out that you had made up almost everything about yourself, even your last name. so now i am left in this position. i am in love with someone who does not exist. that person you made up, she sti will haunts my dreams. i sti will hear her laughter and i wake up reaching for her. but she is not real, just a persona that you made up to get what you wanted. regardless, i sti will see your face at night. so look at what you have done. are you proud? you have done what nobody else could. after everything else that i have gone through, this was the straw that broke the camel is back. i am a broken man now. there is no doubt about it. i barely sleep, i eat maybe ti ames a week, and i rarely leave my room. i wake up calling out your name now as well as da s. so now i am dropping out of college, it is ironic that it is for the exact same reason you told the school. clinical depression. i have lost my hope, my desire for the future. i have no drive, i stopped talking to people, and i just yesterday told my family that i need help. so i am going to get better, i am going to be successful and happy and do everything i can to forget about you. but late at night, when i lay, walking the line between sleep and consciousness, i know i wi will sti will see them. those eyes, looking right into my soul.	not depression

suddenly i am completely alone got my heart broken by someone in my friend group and now he invites them all to hang out except for me and nobody says a word to me about it. they all used to talk about how annoying he was and i was the only one who saw the good in hi am. now they all choose hi am and leave me far behind like i was never there in the first place. i never saw any of this coming and now all i do is sit at home while they are all having fun. i have never felt this alone and humiliated in my life.	not depression
opinion wanted please, is it just a phase? i do not expect anyone to reply but i feel like putting my thoughts into words would help. maybe it is just teenager shit but i used to never cry as a kid and i used to pride myself on that. now i am a mess i take everything too seriously and i cry so easily it is so embarrassing. today has just been a low point for me so i would like opinions and advice. basically i had two exams on wed and thurs music the end to the torture of going up to bray to play the viola. being honest i thought i did fairly alright... well maybe not. but last friday my bf came back home from across the country he goes college somewhere else so i got to meet up with hi am well there was a lot of tension between me and my parents. when i got into the car not a word was said between us and i tried to brush it off but it sti will makes me tear up to this day. and today i just burst into tears in front of my friends when they were making fun of me like they always do. is it just because i have been lacking sleep and it is a phase?? and what do i do with parents who do not approve of the relationship, parents who are like obstacles?	not depression
thank you people just wanted to thank everyone that posts here or other si amilar places. i am a fairly regularly depressed person and it crushes me to death. i am used to the sink, touch bottom scrape and then bounce back to surface momentum i have worked for myself after many years of dragging the bottom steady. life is great and a terrible burden and everyday i have to find a moment to get my breathe and find up again. i like gravitate to all the terribly depressing songs that let me appreciate the beauty of art so many people have bestowed in their own way whether music or art or just words. anyways man, it is a good, and terrible feeling knowing so many other people are feeling it too. it makes me want to surface and bring some sad soul with me for a second, hit that parting glance of like, best of luck, and dive under again. i am glad i have been gifted with this curse of caring enough for it to affect me and i just wanted to let whomever know thanks for suffering a little with me. hope your moment is a little better and whatever and wherever you end up, know i cared if only for a moment. thanks.	not depression
invalid pain i am just so sick of trying got open up to others and they compare your suffering to people is around the world. like i get it, i am not the only one, but that does not make my suffering invalid because i am not alone. it also makes you question yourself, should i be this deep in the pit of despair when others are below me? which just makes it worse. just so sick of invalidation. was told it would get better every year of high school. i am a junior now and have seen no change on the horizon. fuck everything.	not depression
i am going to quit my job tomorrow i feel so useless. i only work days a week and i sti will can not handle doing even that, i cry every evening before it is my first day back in and every morning before i leave. i have a fucking mortgage at and i know i should be grateful that i was in a place where i could afford it but it is such a huge burden on me all the ti ame because whatever happens i can not have a fucking break. i need to make money or i wi will lose the house. but i can not face going into work anymore, the amount of ti ames i have thought about badly hurting myself or falling into the road on the walk in just so i do not have to go. so i am just going to quit and if i have to move back with my mum and rent my house out so be it. i wi will be depressed living back at home but i wi will be more depressed if i have to spend another fucking day at that job.	not depression

for me it is not the depression, it is my lack of belief that it wi will ever get better. just as the title says. i have been living with these feelings since i was young, and i have never gotten better, not even by a small measure. by this point, all my opti amism is used up. i do not see any version of me with a future, and everything just feels bleak.	not depression

i do not necessarily want to die, but i want the person i am to die. i am sick of the person i am. i am constantly anxious, never voice my mind, never stay motivated, and am afraid of failure. as a child i was coddled because i was the depressed kid that they wanted to keep alive. so i never learned how to fail because everything was always too safe. but i also never learned how to get over my traumas and have become this non confrontational, quiet, anxious, talentless nobody. i desperately want to be someone who does not give a fuck and is not afraid of failing. i do not want to lead a safe, safety net life. i have been trying to work on my thoughts, and well as increasing exercise and trying to push myself to be more outgoing, but it is hardly working. i have been doing this for years. how do i force myself to change? and i mean drastically change. if i stay like the way i am now, i would not last more years. i want to be someone who does not give a fuck and gets excited at the concept of success and failure and does not need to be coddled by every person i know. i am so sick of being that person. are there any books or talks someone can recommend, or a way you go about changing yourself that drastically? i want to be completely different. i need to stop being afraid. i need to stop being coddled. i want to live. and i want it to be my way. but i do not know how.	not depression

i do not understand society i do not understand how people can be so pragmatic and emotionally stable enough to work most of their lives doing shit they probably do not like. i do not understand how confident people are, they can make friends with the si amplest effort, can nail job interviews, can have the power not to be trampled on by others. i do not understand biological families and why should random strangers give a fuck about each other. i do not understand why is everyone is going crazy over political shit that wi will probably never affect them. i do not understand this urge to live at any cost, the i willegality of death and suicide, the measures and precautions people take to preserve life. i do not understand most of humour unless it is bleak and morbid. i do not understand the appeal of going to social places, like cinemas, bars etc. movies and tv shows are boring as fuck, i watched thousands of movies, and hundreds of tv shows during my life, but it always felt like a chore to please others watching with me, always looked at the clock or streaming ti ame eager for them to finish. i do not understand what did i deserve to be born hated. i do not understand why we re all here. who cares whether we live or die? to be entertained by boring shit for those few hours people have after work, only to sleep, and have to wake up at twilight? why do we live? why am i here. can i just thisappear?	not depression

nature of depression basically what i see as depression is suppression of positive emotions and intensification of negative, when you are depressed, you can only see what is out of order, you start to compare yourself to someone else is today rather than yourself is yesterday, which makes you resentful, bitter and as a result deceitful. get your act together, put your house in perfect order, accept responsibilities and accept the fact that there are people higher than you in the hierarchy.	not depression

feels like all my passion is just gone my life has been rather stressful as of late, i ended up dropping high school due to not really caring. the only person who was able to really convince me to try and do anything with my life is my therapist. now, i have had a few different ones through out my life, and this was the first one that felt really comfortable talking about things on a more personal level. however, just recently i found out that they wi will be transitioning me off to a new therapist. this is mostly because my original one has too many people they have to work on. i wi will admit that it felt like terrible ti aming, since we were just looking into possible alternative schools i could do. i met my new therapist as well, and i honestly just do not really like them, or at least feel comfotable. the only problem is they are one of the last ones i can see. i just do not see myself working with them out of being uncomfortable. it kind of feels like everything i have been working up on as kind of been ripped away. mostly because i have a really hard ti ame opening up to new people. i just do not really know what to do anymore, i guess i have just kind of given up.	not depression

i just want everyone to know that their not alone. i appreciate having this platform so i can see that for myself. we share a lot of the same problems here but there is always hope. how about we share insecurity we have that triggers our depression. let us thiscuss potential solutions in the comments that have worked in your life. my insecurity is people thinking i am stupid. i have skipped every presentation in university because i am afraid to be put on the spot. i dont go to classes where the teachers call out students because i am afraid to say the wrong answer. someti ames i feel so much anxiety when i talk to people that i mess up my words and can not form a proper sentence. i dread talking in front of groups. this insecurity is preventing me from connecting with people, and showing my true self. when i sound nervous people dont take me serious, they cringe, or just feel bad. this makes me even more stressed out knowing how people see me. i am trying to read more to expand my vocabulary and to become more confident but it is a long process. some days i just lay in bed pretending i am someone else completely.	not depression

here is how to dig out of your hole. now do it say you re , just graduated, and not sure what to do for the next years. say you re trying to.......find a path. well something that really helped me is crafting my vision first. i spent about hours researching and figuring out what it was i wanted to do. instead of just going out to flip burgers etc just for the sake of staying busy . take freaking ti ame to ask yourself how you want your future to be. so many people just go from retail job to retail job, not stopping and asking what the hell is my future? i even quit after my first day at a sweat shop factory because i did not have a vision there. i was on break with a guy who looked like shit and asked hi am, how long have you been here? he said ten years. i did not want to be hi am at . he was my anti model. now i have crafted a vison. thanks to graham stephan, gabe bult, and others.the vison is to be retired by with part ti ame math teaching. based on that i made steps. steps work at local company, switch to higher paying job, save, invest in property, cycle properties, retire by , teach math and enjoy life and family. now that i have a vision, i wi will do whatever it takes because of i have already set my focus on the horizon. everything in the middle are just steps along my personally crafted path. but this is i amportant find people who actually took paths si amilar to your vision. on youtube, on podcasts, and in real life. make sure they were nirm people like you and made it work. model their paths. and go kick ass in life.	not depression

get relief from depression a short guide i am not a psychologist, but i do consider my self an expert in going through and getting out of depressive episodes. have helped plenty of friends in the past, so i thought i d take the ti ame for whoever needs to read this. this is my get back to being functional asap guide. you obviously need to check out more books therapy treatment to completely heal from the roots. . running. once you re depressed you ll either be super lazy and sleepy, or not sleeping at all, so both those wi will ki will your drive for exercise, but this is something you really have to push yourself to do. i think running works best cause if makes you go outdoors. any other exercise would do, but i could not personally do a team thing or be at a gym, so running is my best option. i have run sleepless at am. it doesnt matter. if you re depressed you have to ki will that monster asap. . reading i can not read fiction when i am going through an episode, but reading about depression and psychology has helped me i ammensely. i recommend lost connections by johann hari and how to change your mind by michael pollan. . watch your food. sure, binge on fast food for a while, or do not eat at all for a day or two. then get back on track and plan meals with close friends so you have to eat something normal, cooked well. if you re not eating at all, like i do when i feel like crap, after a while it wi will mess with your head as well. . no substances, especially pot. i am not a drinker anyway, when i am well i might smoke some pot a couple of ti ames per week, which becomes deadly when i am not well. my mind wi will go down that spiral so fast on pot, i know i ll have a bad night. . get out. no tv, no couch. plan something with close friends, tell them to invite you everywhere. you need to be out of home as much as possible, either hanging with loved ones, or working on something you like. . microdosing. this is a recent one for me, but it has worked wonders. in the past i ve been subscribed prozac, xanax, remeron, etc. nothing has worked as well as microdosing on psylocibin. it wi will give you energy, drive, it would not make you high, and you would not get intoxicated. its as healthy, cheap and effective as it gets. i ordered a grow kit from holland and i grew the mushrooms myself, and i ve never taken another stupid, toxic pi will since then . these tips help me, and i hope they ll help you. they work together, its not the same if you just do one of them, so do not just take shrooms and sit on your couch, you re going to have a bad ti ame. again, i am not a doctor, i just consider myself experienced. would love to hear your thoughts. good luck to everyone.	not depression

my mom does not like me and it is really contributing to my depression. i think somewhere in there she loves me. but she does not like me. she does not want to talk to me or be my friend. she never reaches out to make plans. if i did not initiate things we would never see each other. her and my dad live together, so when hi am and i make plans i wi will see her and go say hi and bye. i always feel like i am interupting her t.v. program when i do. if i try to initiate plans with her in person and that usually works. a little walk or brunch or a movie. i text her though and she never replies. even to just the si ample i love you or miss you. i feel guilty complaining about this. she wanted a child so bad. they tried for years to have me. she had a miscarriage before me. i feel like a thisapointment. like i did not turn out the way she wanted and so now she is changed her mind. i hate feeling like this. some women do not deserve children. i know that might sound harsh, but no one deserves to feel the way she makes me feel. she makes me feel like i ruined her dream. i know she is most likely depressed just like me, but fuck man. this shit just hurts. today is her birthday, and i was feeling bad because i have to work all day and would not have ti ame to see her, then i remembered that she does not try to see me or call or text on my birthday. so i guess i have nothing to feel nad about. i shot her a text. it wi will be ignored as usual. i just wanted to get this out somewhere. i feel guilty complaining about this because i know her and my dad did their best to raise me. but i am not grateful to be here. i am terribly depressed and question my existence at every turn. i feel like i am just a product of regretful baby fever. they were too stupid to realize that i might not come out the way they wanted. my dad has accepted me. my mom can not. the only thing i have going for me right now is to try and live my best life out of spite, so maybe one day she wi will see how happy i am and want a peice. and i wi will be there, to give her the same shit energy she gives me now. 	not depression

need help moving on hi all i should probably start this by saying that i do not think i have depression or a mental i willness or anything like that, but i have never been sadder and lately i just have not felt like myself and i was not sure where else to turn to for advice. so there is this girl in my close friend group who i have feelings for but she has made it pretty clear that she does not have an ounce of interest, although she sti will wants to be friends idek if we re sti will friends though . our relationship has become really awkward and strained and i feel like every move i make is the wrong one and makes it even worse. lately she is been feeling down and it makes me miserable to see her miserable, and i feel helpless knowing all my efforts to make her feel a bit better have not done much. everyti ame i think about this though i am reminded of how little i am worth to her compared to how much i care about her, and it is become this cycle of sad thoughts every night. at the same ti ame, i have been dealing with some personal stuff and the little things i once appreciated just are not as nice anymore. i do not even enjoy the stuff i once enjoyed. like i recently hung out with my friends but as ti ame went on i kinda just wanted to go home more and more. they are all great people though and they have given me good advice on how to move on, but it is proving harder than i originally thought. when i get home now, tbh i just sleep because at least in my dreams i do not have to face reality. i feel broken and do not have much motivation to do anything. at first, i thought it was slowly getting better but i came to the realization that it is not after i started feeling sad someti ames at school, even though before i only really felt sad late at night. it is almost like it just accumulates over ti ame. i would really appreciate any input on what i am feeling rn. anything helps. also, thanks to whoever took the ti ame to read the entire thing	not depression
i can not stop overthinking todays events so i donated blood for the first ti ame today a d i feel happy that i could help even just a little. .but , the whole situation around it even though a normal one has bit one i have been overthinking since this morning and i think without posting about it somewhere i would not feel ok. so i recently moved form a small balcanic country to italy. since september of to be precise. the attending doctor compli amented my italian surprised i had been for such a short ti ame only in italy but as i said i would been watching italian tv since i was a kid and it could be the reason the very handsome nurse guy commented that italian is a very wide spread language in x my country and the doctor laughed about it . now here comes the fuck up which i never meant to say but i said and as many ti ames i reply the scene i regret saying it. so basically the doctor asked if this was my very first ti ame donating blood or my first ti ame in italy. i explained that i would never done a donation in x because i was scared . now the doc was very curious and a bit surprised as to why and i said that hospitals there are not very sanitary and its kind of a common fear to not donate blood . in fact this is the idea my parents have and i by no means think that way. i have always wanted to do a donation but my mom and dad forbid it saying it was dangerous and i could contract a decease if i went to a hospital to do so in x. but somehow i ended up saying what my parents think instead of my true beliefs and i feel bad for putting my country down like that feeling like i am in italy to escape a scary place. i am here because the economy on x is even worst than italy. livin in x is basically surviving . anyhow it sounded bad and the doc laughed it off. to top it all my veins were very small and the nurse barely could find a decent one , and he practically stood there besides me holding my arms so the pressure would be ok and the blood would flow. i turned yellow right before it ended since my blood pressure dropped and had to be fed sugar water by the other nurse and i could not even understand her when she asked if i could do it my self so fml. at the end the nurse guy continued to say that the blood was a little less than it should be , the bag was sti will wrigley. and he told me that at the end it wouldn t draw blood anymore so he had to stop it there. everyone got up but they told me to stay there and he the nurse told the other donor buy buy because yarejare has to stay with us a little more and everyone was a bit worried if i was ok. the who thing made me feel kind of bad. like i could not even do a si ample thing like that and on top of it my mom made fun of me saying i am not someone who can give blood so i should not do this a second it. to be honest my parents always tell me i am naive and stupid for wanting to things like volunteer work or blood donation and that i will never be mature enough to understand. i feel like even today i thisappointed them and my self . my dad though did not sound so annoyed as he was when i insisted on donating blood which is a minute walk from my place so it does not even cost me ti ame or anything so in conclusion i feel like i had the most awkward encounter doing what my parents belittle me for. tl,dr trash talked about my countrie is hospitals while being overall the weakest blood donor of the day. also parents do not even support what i do	not depression

forcing a workout exercising regularly usually is a big help for my depression and anxiety. i have also been trying to lose weight recently so have been working harder to fit it into my schedule and taking advantage of weekends for longer workouts. i had a really tough friday afternoon yesterday and ended up taking some klonopin and falling asleep early and sleeping in. today i have a bit of post benzo grogginess and am feeling really unmotivated to do anything. does anyone else force themselves to work out when they are feeling really bad? i do not know if it is worth it and wi will make me feel better or if i should just let myself have the day on my couch.	not depression

the same things that i am thankful for, i can be depressed about the very next day. i am currently wallowing in my own self pity about things that i know are not the end of the world. but i am unable to convince my subconscious of this. yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because i need to remind myself how blessed i am or this wi will happen faster, i was raving about how great my current situation is. i was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much i have to look forward to. but instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. i only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. i was listening to a podcast and they were thiscussing things they would like to do this summer. i guess i could not handle the idea of somebody doing something i would miss out on, and i began to feel i had no way of keeping up. i want things to come to me effortlessly. i do not take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than i am either. when a depressive mood sets in for me, i am unable to comprehend ti ame. i no longer have the ability to understand that i can do so many things in my life because i am only and i have so much ti ame to accomplish all of these things. but i guess the i am only years old thing is starting to wear on me. i have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. of course this is not true, it is just the way i inexplicably feel . so when i start to think about the fact that i want to travel, or i want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case i begin to feel sad. i tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. in my mind, i hate everyone and this is why i can not do this, i have dogs so i can not travel or really leave the house much, and finally it is because i am broke. aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just are not true. so i really have no idea why i believe them. from this point, i began to nitpick every little thing about my life. everything that i do not yet have that i feel for whatever reason i deserve. everything that i have gone through that i feel is a negative is now amplified by in my head. it began to eat away at me. i would like to have the opportunity to travel, i would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, i would like the opportunity to live a full life. this leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. suddenly i wish the dogs weren t such a burden on me that i could travel though i know this is not true and there are dozens of ways i could travel despite being a dog owner. i also love them more than anything in the world and i absolutely hate when i use them as a crutch to something that i do not do. i start to be unable to control my emotions and lash out verbally at them and anyone else around me. which is a trait i gained from my dad and i absolutely hate. i usually am able to recognize it and today i was, and it is usually reminds me that i need to write it out and try to overcome. but when i try to write it out, i find myself getting stuck. i start to feel like i am being thisengenuous with myself, and then i get confused about the way i truly feel about things. literally all of the things that i am depressed about, i was finding reasons to be grateful for just days prior. but, suddenly my current living situation is not enough, and i need to go shop for furniture and decoration and then my funds are not enough and i need to be responsible and i am such a piece of shit for being so materialistic. then my body is not good enough and all the work i am putting in, in the gym is for nothing and i am wasting my ti ame. then i am just lonely and i need people around me but the universe is not putting the right people in my life . the hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days i can poke holes in all of it. unfortunately this is not one of those days and all of those things seem valid to me even as i type. anyway, sorry if i could not condense it in a way that made a lot of sense. i really want to be vulnerable and share on here, because i know so many people go through si amilar things. i really hope that people can relate and feel better. if you read, i hope this resonates with you in a positive way, thank you all for letting me share with everyone today.	not depression

trying to help other people but can not i am happy and bubbly so i must know how to make others feel better, is the reasoning they all come to me for help, i am assuming. recently it has not been like that. i have been stressed on top of stressed by so many different things from different parts of my life, but people keep coming. and they share with me all their sad stories and situations. the worst part is that i empathize with them and understand why they want to do certain potentially harmful things, more than i pity them enough to give helpful advice. it thisheartens me so much to think that there is nothing for a person with the situation i am described of to do. i hate it i do not want to think that way at all, especially at the expense of another person when they are coming to me expecting some life changing advice. maybe i used to be able to help other people and bring smiles back. but now i feel like as a person who rarely smiles anymore i can only do more harm than good if i let people talk to me.	not depression

someti ames i wonder that maybe not being being depressed about the reality of this shitty world is wrong. it is like it is clear for a thinking ,empathetic individual that pretty much everything about this so called reality is wrong .and most people prevent themselves from thinking about this on purpose.they thistract themselves with love ,family,friends ,some kind of purpose,but in the end it all comes down to the fact that pretty much everything is pointless and does not really make any sense . and in order to be a successful ,fully functioning individual in this society ,it is necessary that you suppress these negative emotions and stop thinking .they just want you to become a robot who does what he is told ,reproduces and does not cause any kind of trouble. it seems to me that depressed people just can not help not being ok with the reality of this world .that is why the society does not want them .they think too much.they understand too much.they care too much .they can not help not asking questions .they can not be robots .	not depression

major depressive thisorder, alcohol abuse, and how to cope my story and tips i am using this as a personal writing exercise so no need to read if you do not have the ti ame the worst advice someone with major depressive thisorder could get would be... do not talk to anyone about it. once i did eventually find a therapist we shined a light on things. we realized there was a point where i stopped drinking to have fun and started drinking to cope and that fucking blew my mind. my therapist was right at some point in college i drank so i could temporarily say goodbye to my problems and the origins of that stem from high school i am guessing it was not until a breakup and a couple suicide attempts that led me to get diagnosed. i wouldn t get out of bed because what is the god damn point? those are my tips for taking on major depressive thisorder. if you have any comments or questions do not hesitate. and again i wrote this for myself so sorry if it is a little scrambled. i hope everyone can find light in the darkness.	not depression

i feel extremely depressed when my parents leave the house i am a teen girl. i used to be so excited whenever my parents went away, because every so often they would leave for a few days at a ti ame and i would have the house basically to myself. my sister lives with me, but she wakes up very late and comes home at dawn every day so i am basically alone. i am extremely introverted, always have been. the thing i used to love more than anything else was being alone with my door shut tight so i could watch youtube, read, crochet and play computer games all day. and i would get pumped for staying up as late as i wanted, because it takes an extremely long ti ame for me to fall asleep and i like being able to thisregard ti ame and do things when i feel like it. whenever my parents go, they never say a word to me and i find out later. i used to see it as a pleasant surprise. but now, when i see that they are far away my sister set up a life for them so i can see their locations , i feel so incredibly lonely. i can not function when i am alone and there is no pressure on me. my daily life is high pressure because my school is competitive and i go to an academy where i do research outside work. when i am finally left alone and no one is pushing me, i automatically withdraw and avoid all of the responsibilities i am used to. i just drift through the day, feeling empty, barely eating and thistracting myself from everything. i get so detached. i forget about everyone else and stay in my room for days on end until they return, and then have to readjust to being a part of society. and the worst part is, when i do nothing with my ti ame, i feel the guilt gnawing at me incessantly but i can not get the motivation to move. even typing this is hard. and fuck it, what is the point of even writing all of this on a forum when nothing that you can say wi will ever fix how i feel or genuinely change me? when my parents leave, i suddenly feel how alone i truly am in the world. my mom died when i was years old, and i remember vividly the moment when i saw her in the coffin. that is when it kicked in, that she was dead, that someone i loved was gone forever and the world would just keep on spinning. my parents i have a really loving step mom are really old to have a kid who is sti will a teen. my dad is and my mom is . both of them have had shitty lives and chronic stress. whenever i look at them, i see the i amage of them in coffins, exactly as realistically as the memory of my birth mom. it is scary how real it is, and i know that every second that passes i am running out of ti ame to spend with them. i have cried so much about it and get anxiety every ti ame i see their faces. it is selfish for me to want them to stay alive when it is their ti ame to go. i know both of them would welcome death, because life has always been really awful. as a teen, it is uncommon to admit this, but my parents are like an anchor for me in the real world. i have anxiety which someti ames thistorts my perception and makes me feel like no one gives a shit about me. my family often feels like the only safe haven for me, the only space where i matter and i do not just thisappear. and it hurts how much they love me, unconditionally, and i feel guilty for being as inadequate of a person as i am. when i think about my parents deaths, i think there go the only people who wi will ever love me. being alone reminds me of the real world, in which everything hurts and it feels like there is really no solution. and i know how pathetic i sound right now, trust me, but the truth is that i am really i ammature inside and i sti will feel so lost and insecure in the world. someti ames i wish i could grow the fuck up.	not depression
how to tone down the defense mechanism so i have realized due to my anxiety and depression, and maybe slightly due to some toxic shit in my last relationship, i have a lot of defense mechanisms when interacting with people and the biggest one is constantly being on guard and keeping up a mean front. i know i am not a mean person, there are a lot of people i like at my work for instance, i love making others feel good and if i can go above and beyond for someone i care about i wi will. i know i am a nice person but for some reason i feel like i am always pushing myself away from everyone and my joking behavior comes out as mean and people think i am being too dramatic or too serious. i do not want anyone to think i am rude but someti ames that is the tone that comes out first and it is hard to control.	not depression
i dont know what i am doing with my life i thought i was going into a career that i loved but seeing my peers surpass me in almost every facet of the industry has crushed me. now i am questioning my ski wills, my future, and i am worried for myself. i struggle with wanting to do something great but my depression has bedriddened me. the thought of having a mediocre job in a mediocre firm is my nightmare, id rather die. now i am considering changing majors but what if the same thoughts hit me again? i can not keep running forever. i feel like i am at a dead end.	not depression

depression is . . . depression is . . . wanting to break up with your boyfriend because he deserves better, he deserves a human with a functioning brain. crying in the car. crying in the shower. or si amply not crying at all. figuring out ways to create your own death in where it would not give anyone you care about ptsd, like would it be feasible to drive miles and miles and miles away to an unknown location? where people would just think i went missing or had an unfortunate accident, like hiking and falling to my death due to slipping on a rock because suicide is too much for people to cope with because she was beautiful and intelligent and this and that and some more superficial bullshit. there is no way she would want to die. no way in which she would be selfish enough to do something so terrible to all of her loved ones. what if i said that i understand suicide and i understand depression. how it is incredibly not a selfish thing, it is selfless in its own warped and fucked up way by trying to get out of this unescapable cage that is called your brain. in the end, i would not ever do it due to the fact deep down i know i have purpose and i know that i am here for some reason. someti ames though, this thing called a brain with thoughts tells you other things that make it a little bit harder to step forward.	not depression

man my uncle is doing terrible right now.. my uncle bought a miniature golf course. the guy he bought it from was years old and wanted to retire. he spent about dollars , on the golf course, which was half of his savings. but here is the thing, to manage the golf course he had to move out of richmond, virginia, to akron, ohio. he bought a new house before selling his old house, only to find that his attic has tons of water damage. the repairs itself wi will cost about dollars , when he only spent dollars , on the house in the first place this was in the s . the worst part about it is the house he bought in akron which is a really expensive city to live in cost about half a mi willion. he took out loans expecting to pay it off because of how profitable miniature golf courses are, especially in a really upscale place like akron, ohio. but the story gets worse. the golf course itself has tons of problems. most of the clubs are not pga standard. the old owner was thisobeying the law and dodging taxes to maintain a profit. when my uncle became a new owner, the pga did a mandatory inspection, fining my uncle dollars k and forced hi am to spend another dollars k in repairs and equipment upgrades. on top of that, now that the golf course has such a bad reputation, he is losing business, and people are going bowling instead. for those of you that do not play golf, bowling and golf are rival sports. this is sinking my uncle into a serious depression costing hi am tons of money in therapy. so anyway my family goes out to akron to cheer hi am up, taking hi am to the olive garden. but my bitch sister could not just be normal. she starts screaming at my uncle for supporting joe biden instead of bernie sanders. my sister then ki willed his pet goldfish he always takes to restaurants with hi am for good luck. my uncle has had this goldfish for years. my sister made such a huge scene that my entire family including my uncle is banned from olive garden forever. since my family especially my uncle is super italian, this was a huge blow to his ego. so basically my uncle is in serious debt, his miniature golf course is failing, my sister murdered his goldfish, and on top of all of that he is also banned from olive garden even on sundays .	not depression

after battling depression and social anxiety for years, i finally decided to take meds. i finally decided to give it a shot after years of my therapist trying convince me to do so. made and appointment with a med provider and now i am on my second day of taking paxil. i feel like i have no other choice. my life has been so fucked up by my deoression and anxiety. i have tried so hard and far too long to fight this on my own and it is always been step forward and two steps back. i have tried for years and i finally realized i can not overcome this on my own. and there is nothing wrong with that. i just have to be honest and hope to god this helps me.	not depression

my mom just snaps at me out of nowhere and for the most unreasonable things some background info i currently have a greenhouse in the backyard of my parents home since i live with them. we also have this water system that cleans the water by filtering it through salt, among other things and i need to let the water run for a good minute after i turn the salt system off before i water my plants so they do not die. anyway, after i finished eating dinner with my family, i helped clean up the area but my mom was washing the thishes and i needed to take the compost out to the greenhouse since there was a full bag. it was getting cold and dark outside so i asked my mom if it would be okay to turn off the salt system to water the plants. i honestly did not think this was going to be such a big deal, if she just told me no, sorry i am washing the thishes right now so i kind of want it on i would have been like okay, i wi will wait. but instead, she made this face and sighed loud as if she was exasperated then continued to say i am washing the thishes, can you not see? you have never cleaned or washed thishes in your life so you do not even know how hard this is. i hate it when she does this and it makes me so mad that she can not ever say anything in a nice tone to me. this is why i never talk to my family.	not depression

fear of losing family for the past week i have cried at work the most. for the past week i was holding back crying in front of people, my bosses, my parents. crying for reasons i did not expect. flashback when i entered this job, which is my first job, and seeing a tweet about not letting anyone at work make you feel like family. flashback when i was having job interviews after another and kept getting rejected due to my poor verbal communication ski wills but this job accepted me anyway. flashback to that one person who interviewed me in my current work who is now my boss. flashback to when i met two other people and their work team that somehow adopted me into their team as well despite my weakness. in a way, i had two work families, despite the warning tweet i first read about not letting anyone in. these two families somehow, at least made me forget how i do not even know what to do with my life. these two families somehow, made me forget a high school and a college life i wanted to forget. these two families somehow, saw something within me that made me feel worthy of staying here. these two families somehow, wants me to move out to another team to a client that they say would make me progress my career better. progress my career? that is a good thing right? but why am i crying? no one in these two families treated me as a friend or anything close. no one of them tried to help me when they knew i has no friends. no one of them said everything is going to be okay in a non work context. and yet i am crying. i am not losing them permanently, but it sti will feels like that way. losing them somehow reminds me of my greatest fear. and when that happens to my real family, i wi will be losing the last thread that keeps me in this world...	not depression
i am not going to commit suicide. ever since i had depression started having thoughts of ki willing myself i started smoking. i promise to never commit suicide, but if i ever get a chronic i willness, i would not take the medication needed for me to live. if i die, i want it to be caused by the choices i have made in my life. if, by some miracle, i do not get an i willness i wi will try to live my life as hard as i can. i am not sure of this counts as suicide. 	not depression

when the hunger kicks in and you do not even know why your saying what your saying. today i was in a manic episode, but it was during packing away the apartment. so i honestly have no idea what is in what bag, but i know the stuff is packed! so being a no friends kinda guy, i only really hung around my girl. now that she is back home, i noticed i have nothing, and no body to lean on. no family i can call, no friends i can kick with. i did this, this was what i wanted when i was younger. now? i think i messed up bad, i did not realize the ti ame it takes to really build strong friendships and now i am look at next year like, would anyone really care if i died? i mean yah my girl, but that would be crazy, she would probably be the only person to come. was being alone worth it? like now when all you need is a couch and some food for like weeks ti will you get paid again. now we go sleep in the lil ass z try to pack everything in into a z hahahaha you have no idea. honestly packed mostly everything she owned and had no room for my stuff lol got half a book bag of stuff... i did not want her losing all her stuff, again. idk, i try to be a good guy, but does it even matter? no idea what to do, but, yeah....that is it idk	not depression

am i a horrible person for lying to my roommate? i feel like one... i got stitches in the bottom of my right foot because i left a box cutter blade on the floor. i bought them when i was not doing well and i swear i never used them. i used coping ski wills and did not cut. i am almost a full year clean from it. one must have fallen on the floor because i stepped on it and cut the bottom of my foot wide open. i did not want my roommate to worry about the razor blades so i told her it was a paring knife and that it got thrown away. i also lied about what it was to the nurses because that hospital treated me for my suicide attempt. i got help since and i am doing better. not suicidal. i did not want them to think i would cut myself. i mean, why the hell would i cut the sole of my foot. my right foot?? i can not drive or work or walk without crutches for at least weeks. i kept it a lie because i did not want to worry them. but my roommate found the razor blade that had been stuck in my foot in the trash. she must have dug a bit to find it. i tried to explain why i felt i had to lie, but she wouldn t listen and said that i was now a liar in her eyes and she can not trust me now. i tried to apologize but she just stormed out of my room. so i am just laying in bed pissed off and feeling guilty. i mean, she had to drive me to the hospital to get the stitches. part of me is cringing because i should have told her the truth. but the other part of me is angry that she wouldn t even hear me out on why i tried to keep the truth from her. i just wish i could rewind ti ame and stop all this drama from happening. i just.. need some advice here.	not depression

is my friend severely depressed? and if so what can i do? so i have a huge group of friends that i am apart of because of my boyfriend, and we all get along great, however there is one friend in particular who lately i have noticed, just seems so down in the dumps, one day he posted on his insta that he had a rough day and just wanted people to send hi am funny positive stuff. i replied and asked hi am if everything was okay, and oh boy i did not expect his response. he said he had just left the cancer center after hours of his grandmas chemo and consultations, and i did not even know his grandma had cancer. i felt so bad for hi am and i myself just wanted to cry. then he tells me that he is been living with chronic migraines for the past few months. i just wanted to hug hi am and tell hi am everything was going to be ok. i keep talking to hi am over the next few weeks, si amply because i am just worried about hi am even though in the past we had not talked much. another day, he tells me that he is content with being unhappy as long as we re his friends are happy. and that just broke me, like i do not think i have ever heard someone so broken before. more ti ame passes and he seems to be a bit better, then he messages me and tells me that he finally cried about everything and thanked me for being the only person to ask hi am how he is been doing and taking the ti ame to talk to hi am. to me this was super alarming, as it was worded as a last message goodbye, but nothing happened to hi am. i am just worried about hi am... the other day his dad got arrested and he says it does not bother hi am but i think it does. today he asked me for some good music and i gave hi am a playlist, is there anything else i can do to help hi am?	not depression

i just want to write out my feelings there is no real rhyme or reason to this but i do not really care. for a few years now i have just been sad. i feel like i have experienced every general emotion there is to feel. i feel like there is not a purpose to life, since everyone dies anyway and we re all on borrowed ti ame. i wouldn t blame you for laughing but i am only a year old guy and i just feel lost. i have no idea what i want to do with my life, and i know nobody else does either, but i absolutely hate this feeling. i can not make any decisions on my own. i have lost enjoyment in things i used to love. i am a very ski willed soccer player but i can not even find the motivation to go and kick a ball around anymore. my coach even told me that he can get me to play at the college i am going to i picked my school basically at random and i am not sure if i even want to continue. i think a lot about how i would ki will myself i amportant to note that i would never ever do it and i have trouble believing that normal people never even think about it, meanwhile it crosses my mind at least twice an hour. i am naturally awkward, from the way i walk i have been told i have a nervous walk by one of my friends to just having a conversation with me. i second guess myself, i stumble over my words, i rarely ever say how i am actually feeling because i do not want to upset anyone else. i am very intelligent sorry to sound like a jackass , but i f ing hate school. i can not stay focused on anything because i find it all pointless, and even when i actually try my best, i can not stay on track with the assignment because i just find the guidelines set by the teachers to be stupid, so i end up getting frustrated and editing out huge chunks of my work... only to get ripped to shreds by my teachers when i submit it. i have not told anybody except for one extremely close friend who happens to be on antidepressants how i have been so sad, and the only reason i told hi am was because he has personal experience with it. my dad is very old fashioned and would just tell me to man up as he is said to me so many ti ames in my life i think even god may have lost count. i have not told my mom because she is a psychiatrist herself, and she has a way of making things incredibly uncomfortable for me. also because i have younger sisters, and what kind of role model would i be if they knew i hate myself. it is like i put on a fake persona every single day and nobody knows the real me, i do not even know the real me. i am constantly fighting the urge to cry, no matter where i am. in class, i have to use the bathroom because i started tearing up. at a party i am moderately popular but the only thing people say about me is he is really nice i leave early because i feel so out of place and sad that all i wanted to do was go home and cry. there was a girl and she did make it better for a while although we never even dated, but that is a long er story but things did not work out. i am not too torn up about that, but i would be lying if i said i did not shed a few tears over her. i could go on for so many pages that i could probably write a series longer than game of thrones, but if you read this far, then i have probably wasted enough of your ti ame. i am not asking for anything, and i know this place is not my diary, but i just had to let it all out. thanks again for reading, if anyone actually did.	not depression
i do not even know how to continue... i was at the start of this. i was in th grade and i was good with my friends. we hung out and did talked and stuff like that. but out of nowhere they just ignored me and would talk to me. this went on for weeks and everyday i would just come home from school crying because i literally had no friends. so i got pulled out of school and was homeschooled. since then i have been diagnosed with depression anxiety ocd and tourette s. it makes everyday and i ampossible challenge. fast forward to about a month ago. i am now in tenth grade and have a absolutely no social interaction whatsoever. it sti will made me depressed but it got a little better over ti ame. i texted one of my old friends and we actually talked and played on ps a little bit. i was beyond happy i actually had someone to talk to. we played together once or twice a week for about a month until out of nowhere he would not talk to me again and has blocked me and is completely ignoring me. i know it sounds not like much, but the one thing in my life giving me happiness was ripped away from me. and i know if he eventually wants to talk again i wi will make the same mistake even though he is a complete jerk. i mean just with everything in my life going on and the one thing making me happy being ripped away from me i do not know how to continue. i wish i was not such a wi amp otherwise i could ki will myself and end my everyday suffering. but of course i am too afraid to do it. i do not know how to continue. it is funny even though i want to ki will myself i do not want to die. i just do not know how to continue how to make myself even remotely happy.	not depression

i feel like i am worrying my life away. i have always been a worrier, but ever since i was about , i am the worry has sky rocketed. when i get over one thing, then something else takes its place. they are things most people probably woudnt think twice about, but it wi will send me into a full blown panic. there hasnt been a moment i havnt been panicking except for in my sleep for the past years. i have tried meds, which only made my anxiety worse. i ended up taking days off of work, because i suddenly became terrified of driving. i also recently took a few days off, because i was worried about the caronavirus. i have tried going to a therapist, which helped with the issues i was dealing with at the ti ame, but like i said, new issues just replace the old issues as soon as i get over them. also, therapy was just way to expensive. i have had people guess i was in my s. that is how much the anxiety has taken a toll on my physical appearance. i just dont see an end to this. i feel like i am destined to live a life in constant fear. if it weren t for my family, then i feel i would have left this earth a long ti ame ago. i am just existing at this point. anyone else out there like me?	severe
i really do not see any reason to continue living... i recently found out that because of the medication i have been taking for the past years, i am at high risk of pssd post ssri sexual dysfunction , loss of emotions, anhedonia, i ampaired cognitive thinking, lack of empathy, etc. tbe risks are long term, even lifelong for some people. i take the highest dose for these years as well, making me even more at risk. i also could be permanently unable to trip on psychedelics, or even get drunk or high. besides sex and love, but that is harder to get , tripping on acid was one of the most i amportant things on my bucket list. this ssri bullshit just reinforces my feelings of being sexually worthless, and just not being a human being.	severe
scared to ask for medication from gp? hello, i have been in therapy for a while, and my therapist suggested that i seek medication. my insurance does not cover seeing a psychiatrist, so i have made an appointment with a general practitioner. i have not seen this doctor before. i have been on various antidepressants in the past, and one in particular worked far better than others for me. it is not a controlled substance, and has no potential for abuse. so i am going to go into the doctor is office and ask to be put on that medication again si ample, right? welp, i am terrified. i am afraid she wi will say no, think i am a drug seeking malingerer, or just otherwise react poorly and not prescribe me the medication. has anybody gotten medication from a gp before? do i actually have anything to worry about? anybody have any words of reassurance? it is been ten years since i have been on medication and i am pretty nervous about getting it. thanks in advance.	severe

after suicide attempts i am dreading going back to my job hey. i am in a psych hospital at the moment and am probably leaving tomorrow. it was due to suicide attempts and chronic depression with all the dressings. i work as a dog walker. lots of days i walk dogs for about four hours, and most of them are reactive agressive and untrained. basically dealing with that helped push me over the edge and now i am facing it again on monday. love the dogs but i do not handle tiredness or stress well at all. because of not working for over a week i have almost no money a little cash enough for a week or two of food and c in my bank account. with dog walking i do not make enough to cover rent and my parents help me financially. i just do not know what to do. thinking about monday brings back all the despair and hopelessness but i am terrified of telling my clients that i am done. i have no qualifications, no specific long term career ski wills or experience and huge trouble interacting with people. i just do not know what to do as if i quit i wi will have to face a new job and no money until i find one. i was accepted to do a six month course in photography but need a lot more money to register. just do not know what to do any more and outside of my dr and therapist nobody actually listens.	severe

persistence is key... hey guys. i f have been struggling my depression and anxiety since i was about . i have been through most types of abuse that you can think of on a long term basis and had nervous breakdowns major depressive episodes. i am telling you because one year ago today i was made homeless, for the second ti ame that month. i was absolutely failed by my family for the last ti ame. i have been on anti depressants since i was but obviously, they take some tinkering so lots of chopping and changing and no steady regulation until about years ago! after my second nbd mde my doctor tinkered one my ti ame, giving me the maxi amum dose of my current medication and increasing my anti anxiety medication. this helped a lot! but becoming homeless and moving into a hostel, i hit rock bottom. rock. bottom. suicidal thought so intense and strong but contracted by the i ammense love i have for my partner was torture. like, actual torure . so i started seeing the hostel therapist. she gave me tools to start changing the way i think but to also go back into my memories and process past trauma. i do not know what really happened from there because my brain and subconscious seemed to just take over! so far we have . regulated meds . therapy . coping mechanisms put in place in ti ames of crisis sounds perfect right?! like shit just fell into place?! hells no!! things were so tough! the past year has been brutal! speed forward to this week. again, i do not know what happened as my brain has just been driving and i have allowed it . i have been sluggish in the mornings but got a second wind in each late morning early afternoon! i have been productive! i have left my flat! i have been wearing makeup, showering, doing my hair, going to the shops... ect. i was convinced i was going to eventually succumb to the torture of my brain and get so tired i would just give in to the temptation of opening up my arms. when people say give it ti ame, please try and be patient! get frustrated, shout, cry, sleep in, leave the washing up housework or whatever... whatever you got to do to get through the day, do it! because right now is happening . you need to take care you right now you . this post ended up longer than i intended but if you got this far, please remember, hard work is not always visible. it can absolutely be internal and exhausting!! go forth and love yourself! 	severe
starting my first ever ssri celexa today. also on buspar. could use some insight! cross posted in r anxiety starting my first ever ssri celexa this weekend. also on buspar. could use some input. after being on buspar for a few months, it is helped my anxiety to the point where i do not really have panic attacks anymore, and my general daily anxiety has subsided a bit. but i am definitely not . even though the anxiety is subsiding, i sti will do not feel normal. in fact, i have felt blank for years due to anxiety and depression, my baseline is quite low. i do not really know what it is like to feel normal or . i am just used to dealing with it day to day. i told my doc all of this the other day while checking how the buspar was working. when i look to my future, i do not really see one. not because i am suicidal or anything thankfully i do not have those thoughts, but because it just feels like i am living day by day without much projection in my life. i go to work, go home, and my social life is really bland for a yr old guy. the doc said that depression is definitely comorbid with my anxiety you do not say! and prescribed be celexa. i have never been on an ssri, the only med i have ever been on regularly has been buspar. i am a little nervous to start it, for some reason. i am supposed to take my first dose this morning. doc said the only side effect i wi will probably run into is drowsiness. she specifically chose celexa because apparently it has less severe side effects when compared to zoloft for a guy my age. anyone have some input for my situation? it would be greatly appreciated!	severe
 idk if i have depression, tbh. all i know is i am worthless, useless, stupid, fat, and unpredictable. i think this all started when i just shower everyone with trust and love. let me tell you something about myself. i was jolly, quirky, playful, and si willy when i was a kid. i am friends with everybody in the class. back to the story.. i met my childhood ex best friend back in th grade. were so close that no one could ever separate us. you d see us having lunches together, have tutoring sessions together, playing together, and everything that normal child besties do. but everything changed when we met our rd best friend. they started to hang out much more, leaving me behind but i did not mind cus hey, i am glad that we have more friends to do everything with. all went well until th grade. my ex best friend started to get thistant like she would always try to avoid talking to me, having eye contact, or even sitting next to me. i got really sad that ti ame. what did i do to make her avoid me? and that lasted for months. ti ame passes by and graduation was approaching. we had a little kick off party for the whole class. i was a bit hesitant on attending the party bc i was just not in the mood for anything but i went anyways. not bc the teacher said everyone should go but bc my mom told me to spend the last day of school with my friends . so i did. and that was not pleasing at all. when i arrived in school my other friends i ammediately asked me if i was going to my ex best friend s pool party the day after graduation. of course i did not know about this so called pool party my best friend wi will held for her friends . so they were shocked as i am. one friend stood up and told me something about me and my best friend is rd best friend from th grade. she told me that she is been bad mouthing me from the very beginning. j just fell totally silent at that moment ad my world began crumbling into pieces. fast forward, graduation was over and ti ame for high school. i was sti will down the whole summer and i wanted to get away from people i knew bc i would think that they were all gossiping fallacies about me. so i decided, no. i want to go to a new school for a change of environment. but it was not what i expected to be. i had a hard ti ame making new friends and with a span of days, i quitted that school. then my mom moved me to a high school in our town where all of my elementary classmates were. luckily, they were based on the science oriented classes. and i was enrolled to an arts based curriculum. everyone was nice to me and i started to gain confidence again. until a group of friends bullied me for years. so i found refuge in food. i began to eat a lot when i get sad, or happy. all was fine until i gained weight and my body was not pleasing to look at anymore. and guess what, those bullies started to pick on my body a lot more. they would be shouting walk faster, fatso. you re blocking our way and shits like that. so, i started to eat less thinking that if i would be skinnier, everyone would like me. years went by and i did lost a couple of pounds. i found myself happy again. now, during my teenage years, my father would always have something to say to every action i make. idk why but i just thought maybe he is just tired from work. so i let it slide. but on december , my crumpled up world burned into ashes. my father and i were sitting on the bench in the mall, waiting for mom to finish in the public restroom. he was complaining to me about the agency he was working at, so i just listened and told hi am that it is going to be fine. but then he uttered, i wish i had not build this family too early. that made me stopped listening to hi am and those words kept repeating inside my head. so he regretted having us? having me? or this family? like wth? we were a mistake? is that why he is always hot headed with me? shit happened and i could not take everything they were throwing at me. the pain was unbearable to the point where i would shiver every night while crying. someti ames, i would just contemplate whether to take my own life or not. but then i thought of my mother. i wanted to give her a better life and make her smile more. i do not want to leave her first because that would crush her. so what i do is someti ames, i would just grab the nearest sharpest object and cut my wrists. it was painful but it was good. it is so addicting that everyti ame the pain was too extreme i would do it again and again and again and again until i can feel the pain on my wrists, not the one in my chest.	severe
i feel like i am rotting. do not know what to do anymore... i liked myself in . in i had a big breakdown and was hospitalised. since then i feel like each year i have been slowly rotting away, losing every part of me that made me feel unique or interesting, just becoming nothing. i think my soul died. i feel like an evil, awful person every day and that the universe is going to punish me for something. i feel cursed and like i can not set goals for the future because i feel so sure if i try to do anything with my life something awful wi will happen to me and ruin everything. i am feeling pretty hopeless. at this point i am honestly not sure what to do. i used to be very social but i find i am extremely overwhelmed by everything recently and have been isolating myself a lot of the ti ame to decompress. it makes me so sad that i can not follow my passions but doing anything positive just makes me feel guilty like i am not allowed to be happy and that i wi will be punished for it horribly. i have been told i have ocd, depression and anxiety. i spend nearly all day consumed with ideas that terrify me. i am really stuck on my obsession with morality and good and evil. i am afraid i have done awful things and forgotten about them or someti ames i have upsetting false memories that are hard to tell if they are real or not. trying to be a good person is very i amportant to me and the idea of hurting someone ki wills me. i have tried lots of different medications and some of them work for a while but then seem to stop. i am on mg of cymbalta currently and it helped for a little while but not really anymore. i do not know what to do anymore. i have a psych but they are busy so i only get to see them once every few weeks but it is not enough. i feel like if i have any chance of getting better i need much more intensive help or a big change in medication or something. sorry for the rant, i do not know if i am explaining myself well, i am just sick of feeling like this and watching myself slowly thisappear and rot away. i hope that reincarnation is real so that when i die i can have another chance at life because i often feel like this one is ruined. i cut myself for the first ti ame in a few months last night and then i ammediately felt embarrassed and guilty. i can not keep going on like this. does anyone have any advice of how i can start fixing things? i have tried so many ti ames and it always just falls apart again and i am so tired.	severe
thoughts had depression for years now, but lately it is really really getting to me. everything feels almost like a movie, nothing feels real anymore. i find myself having to faking emotions for people, happiness, sympathy etc. it is exhausting putting on a smile when you would rather be in your bed. i feel bad for the people in my life, i can never give them my full . most ti ames i feel like a burden to everyone, like they would genuinely be better off without me. i would say drugs are the only thing keeping me standing. one day though, drugs wi will ki will me. and for some reason i am ok with that. i am super fucked up because i have that rotten perception stuck in my brain about life, about how there is no point to life, and the second you die it is like you never even existed lights out.	severe

a life rant i moved across the country with my boyfriend months ago. his work wanted to move hi am and we saw it as a golden opportunity to see a new part of the world together. i had just completed years of an engineering degree. i was miserable. that years took me years to finish. those years were a rollercoaster of depression amp anxiety. i decided to ditch that degree. moving felt right. i did not know anyone in our new city, but in all fairness, i did not have many friends at my university anyway. my plan had been to complete an online degree and get a job. i quickly decided that doing a degree online was not for me, so i decided to start a nursing diploma. i am a month into a month program. i can not concentrate in class and the hours of sitting in a chair makes me crazy restless. days go by and it feels like hours. i crash in bed when i get home and sleep hours a day. everything is going downhi will. i have been switching depression meds over the past few weeks and i feel awful. i do not have a doctor that i trust. i know my boyfriend is stressed about my condition but he does not know what to do with me. i have no motivation to leave the apartment, workout, cook, clean, or study. i am eating junk and gaining weight. i just want to not exist. i am thinking about suicide for the first ti ame since high school. i know i could never actually do it. i just feel like i have all the tools to succeed right now, and yet i sti will just can not do it. it feels like every doctor i see, every person that knows about my depression, they do not think it is that bad, since i am clearly showering, eating and not going to ki will myself. they are uninterested in referring me to a specialist, even though the meds amp therapy have not been working. they rush through my appointment and print off an rx for another antidepressant. or raise the dose of the current one. what the hell am i going to do. how do i stop being like this. i just want to hold a regular schedule of waking up, eating, showering, going to school, studying, working out, cooking. why does going through those motions make me want to die. or at least fall asleep. where do i go from here.	severe

do you also get overhyped whenever you feel better? hey long term depressed guy here, recently i am really spending a lot of ti ame and energy and money to get myself somewhat straight so i can live a life that i want. but as a result for the past months i live on a constant roller coaster. i had developped some psychosomatic symptoms like headaches, fatigue and brain fog long ti ame ago i guess as a getaway to avoid feeling whatsoever, but since recently i am all over the place. i can cry few ti ames during the day because i am tired and sick of myself and the world and especially coming back to the same states of mind that feels so familiar and everlasting. however i someti ames just click out of it meditation helps a lot but i end up at this somewhat overhyped state of projecting myself into the future how i wi will do all what i want and be like i want and learn what i want and suddenly things start to interest me and hope is alive. but. what is holding me from doing what i want whenever i feel better is my lack of concentration and this overly happy feeling that everything wi will be alright. like i am too busy about thinking and projecting myself into the future rather than actually taking action, and if i do take action, i end up kind of feeling overly proud of myself like a kid who did something stupid that everyone could but sti will feeling special about it. i always feel like i am everywhere but the present moment and its frustating and tireing and always leading nowhere else but to a dead end where the relapse is waiting. i was wondering do you people feel this too or is it my fucked up personality that is dictated by my genes or parenting ir whatever. thanks	severe
birthday blues it is always around my birthday i get mad depression. it is always either the week before or even the whole month. birthday is on the th and i feel like i have nothing. i have no one so what is the point right? , i hate feeling so hopeless specially when people usually are so happy and joyful about another year. well i am not. i could care less about the next year or the year after that. i got prescribed some medication, and i just do not know how it is going to make me feel or how i am going to react to it. i just want to feel normal and like i matter i guess. nobody really cares and it makes it worse because part of me does not. i hate being here. just venting i hate feeling like this.	severe
i have kinda just lost interest in most things hi, i am new here. i have never been diagnosed with depression, and i think i struggle way more with anxiety than depression. over the years, however, i feel like i have been losing interest in life. i hate to complain, and i realize that my problems are tiny probably compared to most other redditors on this subreddit, but i felt like i had to get some of this out anyway. anyway, nothing really excites me anymore, and the only things i derive moderate enjoyment out of are edm and weightlifting. i have been dealing with some shit in the past few years, including family health problems, social anxiety, addictions, etc... but i have acquired some coping mechanisms for these. however, i have no idea how to cope with a complete lack of interest in the things life has to offer. the biggest issue i am having with this lack of interest is figuring out what to do in school. i am in my th semester at an expensive university right now with a major in mechanical engineering and computer science. i am doing ok in these, but i have very little interest in either and that is causing me to lose a lot of motivation and thiscipline. there is a chance i am not interested because i have not really committed myself to either had professional exposure, but i do not want to be wasting my family is money on stuff i am not passionate about. i have no idea what area of study i would switch to either, as again, i have no other identifiable interests. being stuck at home because of coronavirus has given me some ti ame to think about this stuff, and i am trying to figure out what i should do. i wish i could just force myself to be interested in things, but i think it is a combination of anxiety, low self esteem, and maybe depression that is preventing me from doing so. i was thinking of taking medication, such as prozac, but i do not know how effective that would be. what kind of course of action would y all suggest for someone in my shoes?	severe
i have not eaten a proper fi willing meal in weeks. i have been on zoloft for two years, i am basically on meds so that i do not have such intense lows and possibly off myself. i sti will deal with depression but it is not nearly as bad as it was in my absolute lowest someti ames i forget that even tho my emotional symptoms are not as present i could sti will be better. i have kinda forgot how it feels to be mentally ok and stable. i forget that i can sti will take better care of myself even if i have been worse . i am trying to become human again, making sure to shower several ti ames a week, going outside and eating proper food. i have kinda just lived off instant noodles, gri willed cheese, chips and snacks for a long ti ame. i forget make proper meals for myself. anyway, i am currently making myself some proper food and hope you all remember to care for yourself too. drink some water, eat a good meal and remember you can get better. you re not actually stuck in a rut, it is hard to get out of it, but it is possible. take one day at a ti ame and do your best.	severe

relapse after years in the last few months i have felt myself relapsing, and theres nothing i can do about it. it is helped me realise a few more things about myself, which is good, but as anyone here knows any upside is drowned by the negative. in life i am lost. i have goals i feel like i want to achieve, but truth be told i have lost what it felt like to be passionate about something awhile ago. at this point i just go through the motions replicating what i remember passion and energy felt like, while apathy eats away at whatever i have left. my friends are to busy with there lives for me to bother them with my issues. my family has never cared about my issues, and would prefer to pretend they and i do not exist. work is the same as you can i amagine in the usa, you re a cog they use ti will they see its breaking and then they throw it away. i do not want to harm myself and am not considering suicide, nor do i think i ever wi will again. but i can not do anything except invision this person i want to be and wish i was, everday knowing i am not that person and seeing how unlikely it is i wi will ever be that person. i feel like i have become a void and now i am consuming myself, and i do not have the energy or the knowledge to stop it. it does not help that i got depressing news today. a convention i was looking forward to, after finally finding out days ago i would be able to go to, got cancelled because of the corona virus. sorry for my ramblings.	severe
i really do not see any reason to continue living... i recently found out that because of the medication i have been taking for the past years, i am at high risk of pssd post ssri sexual dysfunction , loss of emotions, anhedonia, i ampaired cognitive thinking, lack of empathy, etc. tbe risks are long term, even lifelong for some people. i take the highest dose for these years as well, making me even more at risk. this ssri bullshit just reinforces my feelings of being sexually worthless, and just not being a human being.	severe
not sure whether to post in r depression r anxiety r social anxiety or r offmychest i work in a cafe waiting on. someti ames when i go up to tables, i can not say what i want to say, i structure my words completely wrong. this happens a lot when interacting with people i do not know well. the worst is when i am asked a question which provokes an ani amated response, when they joke and i reply quietly, or with something that makes no sense. very awkward for me. i have started to notice that because i am only working day a week, i also do this with my coworkers. they do not often make conversation with me, since i inherently give off bad body language, i really do not mean to. i pretty much walk around with a guard either side of my eyes, always looking straight forward or as if i am thistracted. i always have the assumption that the other staff joke about me, i feel like an outsider to the group which also consists of returning customers . it is really difficult to fit in when i am like this. i am very worried this is due to some unrelated events that have happened in the past. i think i am suffering from ptsd. i am hooked onto some thoughts about events that have been and gone. one of them involves grief, and without trying to get sympathy, is a very bad situation for someone to be part of. i wi will often use this thought along with others to conjure up a thought along the lines of if only other people understood i think this is very bad, and i am not sure what it i amplies for me. maybe a personality thisorder? maybe i need to talk to someone about it? i wish i could be comfortable when i am not by myself.	severe
caffeine alternatives to function albeit depression? hi! i am diagnosed with major depressive thisorder, tho my meds help me manage. the thing is, i am pretty dependent on sources of caffeine to aid me in performing my responsibilities. the meds really work more as the shit that helps me get out of bed, but it does not extend as much to keep me rolling, especially with mentally demanding tasks as you know, our brains kinda bog down etc. . however, i am trying so hard to get out of uni and shit, so i am really doing my best to get everything done. in fact, i actually seem pretty high functioning because i do things that just helps me get shit done assuming the stress is not bringing out the worst of my mdd . that said, would you have suggestions accounts of things that keep you rolling to perform your tasks? i either go caffeine overload coffee energy drinks going with just one of either is not enough, has to be both or just get depression naps. the latter does not sit well with me although it is really what my brain specifically needs considering the mental load my brain wears itself out from. i just lose hours to those naps this is apart from my lengthy night sleep and it makes me feel emotionally shitty after that i have failed to do the task. would just want to hear what you do to keep up because someti ames i get anxious that my physical health wi will start deteriorating further because of my horrible and excessive caffeine diet.	severe

i need urgent advice feels like i am going mad i am not sure where to go from here. i have been sitting in bed crying and writing my ex girlfriend a suicide note which i plan to deliver to her tomorrow. i feel like i am losing my grip on reality. and before anyone tells me to wait or sleep on it or whatever, that is what i have been doing for years and it has turned my brain into black rotting goo. i have been struggling with depression for over years. i made the decision to be hospitalized for the first ti ame last month and spent hours on a psychiatric hold. i thought i would finally get the help i needed or at least some direction. it was a terrible decision. i just said what i needed to say to get out of there as soon as possible, but it offered me no relief. i have been on countless drugs and tried countless therapies. no one can offer me relief. there are no decent treatment programs in my state. only programs for substance abuse users. where do you go when you have exhausted every option? when no doctor or drug can help you? when you have no options for long term treatment? i can not go on like this. where have people who have hit rock bottom gone? a person can only be suicidal for so long. you only have so much inner strength.	severe
starting and titrating up on medication advice for those struggling hello everyone. just wanted to give some advice to those struggling as they start medication for the first ti ame or are increasing their doses. since i had a very bad experience with side effects my first ti ame using medication, i thought it would be good to share my tips for getting through this rough period as i try meds again. basically, i have three pieces of advice go slow. even if the doctor says increase every weeks, for example, do not blindly follow that if you re experiencing bad side effects. take twice as long if you need to. when i tried doubling my dose every weeks like the doctor and official guidelines recommended, it was hell most of the ti ame. racing thoughts, insomnia, lethargy, drowsiness, muscle aches, etc. etc. my second go around with medication, i took twice as long between increases and experienced only mild side effects. tiny increases. many doctors and official guidelines recommend start higher than you may be able to tolerate. if the prescription is for mg, do not be afraid to start at half of one quarter of that dose. same goes for increases. many doctors and guidelines suggest making jumps per increase. when i did that, again, it was hell. but i did not know better. do not be afraid to use a pi will cutter and make smaller increases as you go up in dosage. divide doses. if you start feeling wonky after taking a dose, try breaking it up and spreading it out over a few hours for a few weeks until your body gets used to it. there are many who divide their doses into am and pm, and some who divide them even further. if you re experiencing horrible side effects, you re less likely to continue using medication, and even if you re resilient enough to ride out terrible side effects, why torture yourself and put your job, relationships, and happiness at risk? finally, just listen to your body. even if experts tell you one thing, if you re feel like garbage when taking medication, go slow or go small.	severe

youth teen mental hospital cost? i have been having frequent thoughts and consideration of self harm and suicide and think requesting to go to a mental hospital for a bit might help. i am desperate at this point because nothing has seemed to have been working so far. countless therapy sessions, talks with my doctor, increasing and decreases my dosage of prozac, i even got sent to the emergency room one ti ame by my therapist so that they could take me to a mental hospital but deemed me fine and sent me on my way even when i looked in the doctors eyes and flatly said i have frequent thoughts of suicidal and yesterday i got the closest to ever cutting myself in my entire life . the only thing really stopping me from talking to my parents, therapist or doctor about this is worrying about the cost for it happening. my parents already have to pay for so much shit that i have caused like my meds, therapy sessions, frequent doctor visits and that one emergency room fluke visit must have cost a shit ton even when all they did was give me a cold hamburger and took my blood. i only feel like it would be an even bigger burden which would only make me more suicidal honestly, which is a bit ironic since i am trying to go to a mental hospital to get help for that. i am from georgia, almost years old now. do costs vary from area to area? if anyone has any experience with this, what is a general idea of what the cost would be. i have a job right now, so maybe i can save up for my own stay. i am so desperate at this point that it might come to me just having to pay for it myself. that would probably take over a year honestly and i do not know how long i have before i do something rash. i appreciate any advice with this, thank you.	severe

xpost from mental health wanting to move on yet feeling not ready to move on i have this inner conflict. after talking to people with major depression resistant to treatment who have recovered, i feel like i want to move on. they had severe depression which had no relief, but they recovered. i start to think, i should not have any insecure attachment or codependency issues. i can move on like them, even if my appointment is postponed . months. the other part of me is thinking, can i move on from having an insecure attachment style to my mum? i want to be mentally stable and go overseas to work, go to the countryside, explore the bustling city. i want to ride scary rollercoasters again without getting too anxious. there is life outside a hospital and constant outpatient appointments. probably black and white thinking. its not an either or thing. i was so ready to move on, i managed to stay on for months on my part ti ame jobs, things were going well. like i knew i got to a point where i did not have serious self harm urges or suicidal ideation. i felt like i was healed by god too. christianity . i hated some parts of my past, but i loved some parts of my past the clubbing, the rollercoasters, the events which i went to. i hated being bullied or left out or failing academically. but i loved it when i could actually excel in the modules i loved, and i could write about cool stuff. i was so ready to break away from the identity and labels people have given to me. but there are some events and situations which wi will bring me to feeling useless again. and stupid. like accountancy or being in a social setting where i do not feel welcome. like i feel, how hard is it to wait . months for the next appointment? just live my life and do shit even if i do not have much of an income right now and wait for ncov to tide over before finding new jobs? then the other part, is a child like baby part which needs protection. can not touch accountancy at all costs, my adhd pi is making it i ampossible, even if i may have severe levels of social anxiety.	severe

hellooo, i do not know what i am doing. i have been depressed for as long as i can remember. at first i was just sad all the ti ame. i would cry over stupid stuff and i felt like the world was just crumbling around me. then my mom had me take her antidepressants then i actually got on my own and became addicted to this anxiety medicine. i ended up overdosing and ever since then i am not even sad anymore. i am not angry. now i feel empty. i do not remember things well, i sleep too much, i sleep too little. i eat too much, i eat too little. i do not exercise but i do not like myself. that is it. that is the root of it all. i just find that i do not like how i think because it is so empty. absolutely mindless. but i am too content to try and change any of it. my last therapy appointment was a few weeks ago. i told her i was content with being sad. wanting to die. i was content. she responded with, well, why are you here then? i was then counting all the minutes down to the last because man. what was i doing there? what am i doing? even writing this i just feel completely undeserving to express how i feel but how i feel is so hard to express because it is nothing. most of the ti ame, it is nothing.	severe

medications... hi everyone, i just joined reddit. as someone formerly diagnosed with depression and an anxiety thisorder when i was i am now , i was wondering what medication you have found that has helped you manage your symptoms. i have taken celexa, prozac, effexor, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, and seroquel. the one i have taken the longest and had probably the best experience is prozac, but it makes me terribly tired and sort of dulls me out. i am on mg right now, but i am feeling pretty depressed and hopeless. the current state of world affairs does not exactly help either.	severe
how many ti ames until you found the right antidepressant? i have been on zoloft it makes me feel nothing absolutely zero. i feel numb and made me tired. it helped with my anxiety though a little too much. there are ti ames i need to feel anxious, and this antidepressant did not allow me to do that. the one i am on now is called wellbutrin which is more of a sti amulant which is why i was switched to this one but it makes me feel angry and i ampatient even though it is the one that worked the best out of the two. it helps with my depression greatly but honestly, is it worth it if i am going to be a ticking bomb? i feel like shit after i explode. i am tired of fighting honestly. i never wanted to get on medication but i have got no other choice. i have figured my options are either this, an addiction to some drugs or alcohol , or suicide. i put aside my pride, and my preconceptions to get help but now here i am. battling it out. like most depressions some days are better than others but right now i am so tired. it is hard. let me know what medications have worked for you. thanks.	severe
ahhh i am back on my meds and it makes me twice as suicidal as before. just great. also i have found myself thinking about my ex a lot more and it is absolutely fucking with me. i want to just neck myself i amma be honest. i am so tired.	severe
depersonalization depression autopilot i have just recently learned that the feeling of auto pilot that i have been having is in relation to the depression that i am having about adopting a child. my baby is due april and i have been having a lot of issues with the stress of the homestudy the stress of getting the house ready for the child. about three weeks ago i started shutting down. i did not want to go out, i did not want to eat much, and i did not even want to go to work. the last two weeks of the depression was basically being on autopilot. this is actually called depersonalization thisorder. when situation gets too stressful your mind begins to cope with it as if it were watching it from a different perspective, hence the term autopilot during that ti ame i quit smoking and had to be determined to make some changes emotionally and mentally. i am really big on not letting emotions control you because i believe our emotions lie to us. but the weird thing about it is depression is not an emotion it is actually a situational thing. when you re depressed you do not feel. i need to be determined not to let this depression to continue to hold me away from who i am. this was gradual. but more and more i feel like myself. taking control of my thoughts and my situation. thank you god for giving me google and the mind to put two and two together.	severe
my manic depression i have manic depression, it is like you have a constant conversation with yourself and a lot of ti ames out loud. my girlfriend would frequently ask who i would be talking to in the bathroom for mins out loud and i did not even realize what i was doing, it ranged from self harm to even someti ames just planning out the day and conversating, but been prescribed zoloft for weeks and they are all gone i did not even know that it was not normal i thought everyone was like that in a weird way it is like i am free of that and can hear and see more clearly because my mind is setteled i was never alone it seemed because it literally feels like somebody else is inside your head speaking to you but mine it was just like an alter ego in my head controlling my feelings, it happened one night where i went out with friends and was a little intoxicated suddenley it started speaking to me ended up in a hospital for trying to commit suicide than a pychward shortly after it was the worst but best ti ame of my life because since then it is altered my reality and medication and treatment makes it so much eaiser best thing is to get help, i only write this so maybe somebody reading can relate and i can say you wouldn t ever of thought i was going through this was in a fraternity and a semester away from getting a degree have a girlfriend and one night it just snapped and i lost and half liters of blood and was getting surgery in the hospital if you think you are depressed and beyond sad and you can not remember what the weather was like get help if you are isolated you are not alone and things only get better wrote this for me as a form of expression	severe

i am tired of hearing that my negative thoughts are not true i am at the point where i do not even know what to say when i vent. cbt does not work for me because i know all of the things i think are true. things really are that bad. i am and in need of dentures that i can not get, i am a shut in, my last real long lasting relationship was years ago, i have no friends, i sti will live with my parents, i can not attract others attention organically and nobody puts effort into a bond with me because they do not think i am worth it. i am at a loss of what to even do. every day i do the same shit and i am so agoraphobic that i can not even leave the house any more. i am in therapy and i have only had sessions so i am not really expecting results yet but i feel like i need deeper help than a once a week minute session can give me. i need to be resocialized because i have literally been living in complete isolation for almost years now.	severe
a rant that i made in ive gotten better why is depression even a thing? it is such a terrible thing. i makes tons of people ki will themselves, someti ames without a reason. i had and sti will have depression. i know what it feels like or the general feeling of it. for me, it came out of nowhere. maybe not nowhere but i dont know what caused it exactly. i can just guess maybe it was because i moved to a new state and am not a socialable person, so i just felt lonely or what. or maybe it was because of my dad. i honestly dont know, but i am not here to talk about how i got my depression i am hear to explain what it is done to me and many others. some of the people i look up to have had depression like suga bts and sultan sketches. and mainly that is that reason i look up to them. they have lived through it and i hope i can to. now a few days ago i broke. i cried and i seriously thought about ki willing myself. i have been better since then but sti will because of depression my personality got more conserved and shy. i mean i was shy before but never this shy. i avoid talking to people because i am afraid i might do something they dont like or intrude on them. like i dont want to make other people feel like being around me is a chore for them, so i just dont talk to others. i mean if i say something, i might offend them or just get to close to them just to be a third wheel. trust me i have been the third wheel of many many friend groups. i would just be in the back following them and listening to them as they talk, but never saying anything. i have had some friends that i really connected with. those great friends should be enough for me especially when i have such loving aunts, uncles, grandparents, and parents. but i sti will feel so lonely. i feel like i can not tell anyone about my depression because it would only burden them. you see i can not talk about other people is depression, but mine literally tells me i am inferior to everyone, i dont deserve anything, and i am always bothering others. this means i think thoughts about how this other girl is smarter than me and another person in nice than me. i want to die, but dont deserve that. so, i should not pass on my sins to others and be peaceful when i am dead, while they suffer. i dont deserve the peace. lastly, the bothering others one means i dont talk to others because they dont like talking to me, i dont ask for help because that means i am taking up someone is valuable ti ame forcing them to help me out of kindness, pity, or just to help out their persona. anyway i need to sleep. oh yeah, so depression also made me depend on ani ame wow such weeb to essentially run away from my problems and or depression because it introduces me to another world for a few minutes and i am only thinking about that world and not mine. this is why i gravitate toward books, movies, and ani ame that are action, romance, or someti ames comedy based. it also made me lazy lazier by not giving me the wi will to do other things, helps not a good thing me procrastinate more because honestly i just want to go back to watching that amazing ani ame i have an ani ame watched list. dont judge so i can be happier and forget about my problems. i am such a coward, running away from my depression instead of facing it head on. that is probably why my depression left for like months not completely then knocked on my door and said, guess who is back??? depression is back. anyway i have to sleep it is almost midnight.	severe

i tried to ki willmyself, now feel even more lonely. on wednesday night, i overdosed on co codamol and citalopram, went unconcious on my bedroom floor and my brothers found me and called an ambulance. woke up in a amp e trauma room with an airway tube down my throat and on a drip. stayed the next day and night on a ward receving nac treatment and spoke to a mental health nurse for about ten minutes. i did not want to go inpatient, so agreed to home treatment instead i have been inpatient before and fully hated it . turns out home treatment means a nurse came to see me at home for minutes, spoke to me a little and then left. now i have an appointment with my cpn in over a week is ti ame. i am just sat at home feeling so alone and forgotten. my family and friends speak to me sti will but it all feels so strange, like i should not be here. i do not feel completely safe and do not have any plans to attempt anything, and i do not want to go back to hospital. what options do i even have now? i find it incredibly difficult to open up to people and it takes months to start trusting mental health workers. i know that if i went back to hospital or rang for my suicidal thoughts, they would almost certainly put me back as an inpatient on a mental health ward. and since i do not want that, what else can i do?? i feel so helpless and stuck, my chest is heavy and i am scared.	severe

i have bipolar thisorder and a lot of chaos in my life because of it. in a girl i had been dating for years and i broke up. it was extremely rough on me. so rough, in fact, that i quit my job of years, burned through my savings, ki will my credit, and checked myself into a mental hospital for a few days. the doctor there diagnosed me with bipolar thisorder and prescribed some meds. i took the meds for awhile and jumped from shitty mini amum wage job to shitty mini amum wage job. i was only staying at these places of employment for a few days then id quit. i found the meds were just making my moods worse and i stopped taking them, and moved back in with my parents. i found a decent job that i held for months and actually met my current girlfriend there. that was a hard ti ame in my life, but i got through it. cut now to , my girlfriend and i have loved together since july and we re really happy together. recently ive been feeling the depression come back and i dont know why. i quit my job where i was making k a year to take a few months off. i burned through the little bit of cash i had in my savings and now have to get back to working. i have a job lined up, not a great job, but it wi will definitely pay the bi wills. the thought if going back to work is crippling to me. i know i have to hop back to work to support my girlfriend and i, but it is a hard mental block fit me to get over and i am scared i am just going to quit again. i went back to the doctor to try different medication, but after taking it for a month my girlfriend told me it made me paranoid and she didnt like who i was when i took it. kind of a subject change, but bare with me it is all relevant in july of i had just quit the job i worked at for months. to pay bi wills i had to sell all of my guitars. ive played guitar since i was years old and was actually in a touring band for years. my band isnt together anymore so selling the guitars was a no brainer, i had to support us. it was sti will one of the hardest things id ever done. i hadnt played in awhile and thought it wouldnt bother me too much, but it fucking ki willed me. i feel music has defined very much of who i am. in my band i played guitar, sang and wrote all of our songs. i felt attached to my instruments. my girlfriend is also a musician and has a guitar around the house that ive been rethiscovering my passion on. i feel pathetic because i feel uncomfortable playing her guitar. she always says honey, we share everything it is your guitar too , but, and i hope this doesnt sound shitty, i take playing guitar a lot more seriously than she does so i feel sad and awkward not having my own guitar. she works at a national guitar retailer and gets a ki willer thiscount. she convinced me i need to get my own guitar again and i agreed, but the problem is we arent financially at a point where we can do that. she sti will ordered the guitar i wanted to the store and put it on layaway for a few months, but i dont feel like i wi will ever be able to pay it off. my old drummer is coming home to visit in may and we are trying to get a show booked, but i am scared for some reason it wi will not happen. we have a really good presence in our area cus we played here for years, and again not to sound like an ass, but we always brought a decently sized crowd. every venue in the area is booked. we decided we want to play a show in our old studio, we have played shows there, we didnt think our studio manager would care, but when we asked hi am he said i wi will have to think about it which is fine it is his studio i totally understand that, but i am sti will a little thisappointed. to make matter worse, we have to get half this guitar paid off before i can take it home. with only one month between now and the show, my job not starting for another week, and all the bi wills we have to catch up on, it feels like i wi will never get to play music again. my one creative outlet and the thing that means so much to me, i feel like i wi will never get to do again. i feel completely hopeless. of course the most i amportant thing in my life shifted from muisic to my girlfriend and our small fanily of ani amals, so i feel guilty for trying to make my music a priority and all. i just sit and think about me and my best friends opening old shows with tubthumping and the crowd singing along and having a great ti ame and i just dont think i wi will ever get to recapture that feeling again and ah fuck ive started crying as i type this out. sorry this post is so long. i feel hopeless and it is all over dumb stuff. like who gives a fuck that i wi will never play music again, or at least for a long long ti ame. who cares that i feel like i can not hold a steady job and dont know why. it is selfish of me to want to put myself first at all and i feel really dumb that i even typed all this out. i just dont feel like i have anyone to talk to. thanks for reading if you did read it.	severe

i feel completely trapped in my life and have no idea what to do any more besides just dying i have been unhappy for a very long ti ame. i think some of it is because my life circumstances are horrible and some of it is just because i have depression and a bunch of other chronic i willnesses. i can not really do anything about either problem bc i am completely overwhelmed and i have basically no support. whenever i try to address my terrible life circumstances, it backfires and they get much much worse. i am in grad school and it is absolutely awful right now and i can not leave and when i try to talk to advisors, deans, ombudsmen, etc their help is next to useless, someti ames talking to them makes the problem even worse than before. i am completely dependent on grad school for income, health insurance, etc and i am so physically and emotionally exhausted that i do not even have the capacity to look for a different job. i am honestly so incapacitated by depression that i do not really think i can work at all but i am not even sure that i can go on thisability right now. i have a lot of health problems that are poorly managed and basically no support for those either. i keep telling my doctors that i feel awful and have zero quality of life and they mostly just ignore me, tell me i am a hypochondriac and there is nothing wrong, treat me like a human scab and talk to me like a house pet. my therapist and psychiatrist keep telling me how great i am doing and when i ask them where they get this idea that i am doing great they would not answer. i keep repeatedly, urgently telling them that i feel terrible and they basically just tell me that i am fine and i do not need anything. i do not know what to do. normally when you re having a problem at work, you talk to the people at work about that problem and they help you. normally when you have a medical problem, you talk to a doctor and they help you. i do not even have the support of my family right now bc they keep talking about how great i am doing and how i am so much better. whenever i say that i do not feel better, i actually feel worse they just tell me that i am stressed and that i wi will feel better once i take a vacation. how the fuck am i supposed to make my life better if all of my support systems are offering me no support? everyone says ask for help when you need it when someone is considering suicide, but here i am repeatedly asking for help and being told i do not need it and nothing is wrong. how the fuck am i supposed to refrain from suicide if i am literally trapped in a life that makes me miserable and no one wi will help me?	severe

super depressed and i am scared. so i have dealt with anxiety and depression since i was a teenager, i was diagnosed when i was with depression, social anxiety, and general anxiety. i am now and i have spent all these years managing my depression and anxiety without medication. but whenever i feel myself slipping into that dark place i always get scared. wi will i pull myself out of it again? how long wi will it take this ti ame? my husband has been laid off from work for weeks and we are trying to save money for something i amportant coming up soon and now we may have to dip into our savings to survive because we do not know if he wi will be paid for his ti ame off. it feels like the world is falling apart around me. it is been super stressful and i feel so alone. i can feel myself sinking deeper and deeper. i did not get out of bed for hours this morning and i only got up because my husband coaxed me to. every single ti ame i try to reach out online i get shunned. i am in a facebook group for highly sensitive people and i posted my concern there, the post was removed. i posted it in other subreddits. post removed. i read all the rules and i do not see anything that i could be doing wrong but it just keeps happening and i for some reason just keep trying instead of taking the hint that nobody cares and i am such a screw up that i can not even vent on the internet properly. i have probably overlooked something in this subreddits rules since i am a screw up and scatterbrain and so this probably wi will get removed too but i just wanted at least one person to see me...to know i exist. it is weird i want someone to know i exist but also have the intense desire to just isolate myself and i amplode. i know what to do, i know i need to go for a walk, exercise and do things that bring me joy. i am just finding it hard right now.	severe

 ss i am currently going through a hard point in my life. one of those, i have a good life, why am i sad? . i have been here before, with more valid reasons. angst concern of future and present , has been developing into depression concern of the past, and indifference . scratching to stay above. looking for peer support, kind words, and help. scheduling an apt with my therapist asap. this wi will sound scrambled, but. i do not have it as bad as some people here. i am not suicidal. nothing horrible has happened to me. it is more of that, subtle baseline sadness that you can not shake. i am just sitting here by myself bawling and the idea of spending ti ame with people is so unappealing to me. and that is just not me. it is horrible. i had an anxiety attack last week where i came close to passing out and i hyperventilated which is usual. but i just have not been able to bounce back since. the panic attack occurred because i was attempting to build my core, as i was on schedule to have a surgery that would i amprove my quality of life on cancelled since covid . i just feel like i am drowning, but i have nothing to drown in. and i am just continuing to try and try and try to pull myself out of it but i keep getting bogged back down like a fishing bobble. things keep pulling me under. nothing in particular, but nothing is bringing me pure happiness as it has before. i live in an area that has the most greyest days and cloud coverage in all of the us . it is just gloomy. no sun. on warm days, it is sti will overcast. typically i have combatted seasonal depression with welbutrin, vitamins and tanning. i have avoided tanning, as it is at my gym and once again, social thistancing due to covid . anxiety is in the air but in conjunction with that. anxiety to me is the fear of the future or what is going on. to me. and depression is negative reflection on how bad things were are. and i just do not want to see my friends lately, and have no desire to do so. and like, i like those people and i am social to some extent. i just feel like if i stop cleaning, or moving that i am actually going to fall into staying in my bed all day depression. and it scares me how close i am to that. and i feel even worse, because i do have a really good life with good people. i can not explain why i feel this way. it just feels like nothing is as bright as it use to be and it hurts. and i feel like i have been a bad friend to my close friends and i hate it. i feel like i have not been available for them. i have pregnant friends, long thistance friends, who all have reached out, sent me gifts and thinking of you . countlessly reach our to me. and i reiterate, hey i am not mentally there today, but please do not stop inviting me out. i appreciate the invite .	severe

anyone can relate? hi, i uh found this subreddit. kind of want to just vent since i do not really have anyone to talk too. people are either really busy, or arn t really interesting in anything i haves to say. i gotten used to it, being alone you know. taught me to watch people, and learn emotions and such. however.. there comes that price of feeling of worth and self worth is not being there. or having any real value to anyone really. i tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago due to ptsd, and years of just guilt and loneliness building up. i got that one friend and then lost that one friend because i am fucked in the head from growing up without any real social group to be in. i did get called after my mother saw how many pi wills i took at once and me just drolling on the floor passing out. i was put in i ampatience for awhile about weeks. worked with some clinician and i did felt like i was supported, and liked. all the doctors that heard my story, and my experiences. i was told i had a big heart, a very big heart. which i have a hard ti ame believing in because of the things i done, and the things i could not fight back on. i guess another big part of my feelings is that i could never forgive myself, i could not forgive myself for not being able to fight back being sexually assaulted, i often feel like it wouldn t matter since i am male, and males are viewed a invulnerable, but it si amply is not true. i remember seeing terrors of people is eyes, and alot of haunting memories that just fucks with me. anyway i do hang out with this group at school and when i just vanished for weeks. no one asked the question of what happened to me, it was like i was a ghost. it really got me thinking if i really mattered or not. i get people do care about me, and i am able to do great things. i get the crap, but... i sti will just want to be able to have friends.. like actually friends that can try to work through my bullshit i am trying to work on. and accept me for who i am. this is not a pity post, this is a can anyone truly relate post.	severe
i do not know what to do anymore getting therapy is taking a long ti ame, my anti depressants have not helped at all. i just do not know where to go from here, it only seems to get worse and worse. one thing that really ki wills me is knowing that i can not rely on other people to help me get through it, it is up to me to take the steps in order to get better . i do not even know what getting better means anymore, i honestly do not see how i could be any different. i do not want to put extra weight on people is backs, even if they tell me it is ok to do so... sorry for spamming this subreddit, i know i am a burden but i am really hopeless now. nothing seems worth the effort.	severe

another failed suicide attempt. things get better? my ass. again it doesnt matter what happenned to me, why i am suicidal, because ive lost count on the reasons. my earliest memories of my life, i was depressed, dead mummy aint helping. so anyway yesterday after punching the crap out of basically everything that was in my bedroom i rode my bike and went to the german railway, i took a nice pic of it and sent it to my only friend who understood and got or pretended to get worried. so i lay on the railway with some music and wait for the train to run me over. it came and i learned that trains have a very loud horn. i dont understand what happenned. i got off when it was like meters away. i couldnt control it. it was against my wi will. when i saw the sunrise the next morning i was so angry, i wanted to punch the sky. and noone cares or knows. only that guy on the other side of the world. oh and i am insanely stupid and a dirty little bitch, too. just a reminder 	severe

fuck hope. i am tired of hope. i am tired of excitement. i keep on getting excited about things in my life and i keep getting let down. i am just fucking tired of it. for some backstory, i have autism spectrum thisorder severity moderate , adhd, a learning thisorder, depression, generalized anxiety thisorder, panic thisorder, and a few other things aside from those. the greatest hits parade. i always knew i was autistic, and had this confirmed by a few psychiatrists, but never a formal diagnosis. that is, until a month ago. i finally managed to get an appointment with a great establishment that did assessments for free. i walked in with just depression and anxiety on my official transcript and walked out with that whole laundry list. none of it was a surprise, really. after telling me the diagnosis, the dr. expressed a lot of concern over how symptoms as severe as mine should have been handled starting when i was very young. she had no idea how i had survived years like this, and expressed that she wanted to get started with treatment asap. i was super excited. for the first ti ame i would start getting real answers and real help. she said they would get in contact with me about scheduling an appointment as soon as they could. a couple of days go by. i am sti will excited, i can not wait to find out when my first appointment wi will be. a week goes by. i am starting to get upset and confused. they said we could not wait even a week to get started. what is wrong? two weeks. i am angry. i have given up hope. i do not care anymore, and i do not want to talk about it. finally, they get back to me. and the appointment wi will be another two weeks away. i was crestfallen. but at least i knew when it would be. fast forward to today, the day before the appointment. finally, finally i would have the chance to talk to someone who understands me, i can be myself without fearing ridicule, i can talk to someone without feeling inferior. i am so excited. until i get an email saying all appointments are cancelled for the next two weeks because of the coronavirus. why do i do this to myself every ti ame? and why does it always happen to me in particular? within the past three years, i could count on a single hand how many ti ames i have been excited for something and that thing actually even happened, not even taking into account whether it lived up to expectations or not. everything i get excited about falls through. every ti ame i am hopeful i get let down. it feels like life is a kid crouched by an anthi will on a sunny day with a magnifying glass and i am its favorite ant to torture. i am so ready to give up. i thought i was days away from starting my journey to getting the help and services i needed finally, after years of suffering, and yet even now, life finds a way to keep pushing the light at the end of the tunnel further and further back. i guess i should expect them to extend the period they are canceling appointments even longer than two weeks. i mean, it would just be foolish to think something could go my way, after all.	severe
how does getting meds work? at my last appointment my psychologist not psychiatrist decided that it would be best for me to go on medications. we both agreed that we would try other options first and go to meds as a last resort. she decided that it would be best for me to go on depression medications. how does it feel work. i know where i live she can not directly prescribe them, so how soon wi will i get my medications? i know she wants to talk to my dad and see whats worked for hi am since he has depression as well and has tried various drugs. basically whats the ti ame line for this sort of thing. i have no clue how it works and id ask my therapist but its a late night question and just a curiosity i dont need to address outside of an appointment.	severe
tools to help manage treatment resistant major depressive thisorder? i have been battling depression for years with no relief. i am currently in therapy, i am on my third anti depressant, secondary medications do not seem to working but i have only tried two. i want to know if there is an app or a website that can help me on really bad days. somewhere i can get help working through my emotions and get general information and self help stuff. anyone know if this exists?	severe
when the medical system could not seem to figure out what was wrong with me, i sort of gave up i was odd growing up. a funny odd, that got along with most people. i had friends in high school, but kind of pushed them away because i loved hockey too much. i trained all the ti ame, and looking back it was a great escape for me. i had such bad anxiety, but there is no thiscri amination on the ice, and i was si amply the best. i felt invincible. the only thing i wanted in life was to win a state championship, and i dragged my team to a good seed in the tournament my junior year. but going into it i got my first concussion. i played through it because my whole life goal was in front of me, then i got another one. then my senior i got two more. then in college i got one, and played through it until things got... bad... so i have recovered from all my concussions and am now dealing with post concussion syndrome in my junior year of college. my memory tested as severely i ampaired, i can not put words to my thoughts, and my anxiety is stupid bad. i can not even be in a car when i am not driving, as my heart wi will literally be pounding the entire ti ame. so the only thing i have ever truly loved is hockey, i can not play that anymore and no coach likes me enough to have me help them. i have never built good relationships with head coaches, because i have always been so close to defensive coaches. i am honestly a ridiculously smart hockey mind, but that means absolutely nothing once you stop playing. so now what i have worked on my entire life means nothing. i forget what i am doing at least ti ames a day. i use waze to get to places that i have been to thousands of ti ames. i miss several doctors appointments and forget to schedule so many. my parents and siblings treat it as a joke because i look fine. i have li amited ski wills for the outside world, and honestly have not cared nearly enough about finding an internship. i am tired all day, in part because i am depressed and in part because of my head. i can sleep for a long ti ame... much longer than the average person. i was robbed at gunpoint earlier this year and literally forget what happened and the da is constantly bugging me about that situation. my friends only liked me because i was fun to drink with. now that i can not drink they do not like me. i have found more friends that i am more comfortable with, but telling them this a few months into a friendship would be a great way to end up with no friends. i have ibs so my stomach is constantly tossing and turning. the only thing that settles it is weed, but my parents would murder me if i ever got caught with it. i used to smoke fake carts, but now i do not really because i am afraid of vitamin e oil. the gym is my only escape because i can not play the sport that i love. the gym is now shut down for coronavirus concerns. ever since i got home from break the only thing i found wholesome in life are my two cats. one i knew did not have a whole lot of ti ame left, but suddenly took a major turn and looks like she has maybe a couple weeks. the other was supposed to live for like idk, five more years. today i woke up and she has paralysis in her back legs. like wtf. i just needed to rant all of that out. you can comment if you would like . and tbh the only part of that story that is exaggerated in the slightest is me dragging my high school team. we were a lot better than i give them credit for.	severe
lather, rinse, and repeat i have really been a depressive since the age of now . in my late teens, my anxiety became too much to handle and i reluctantly jumped on the psych med merry go round. i used ssris for a couple years and experienced some benefit, though never achieved full remission. due to the emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, among other side effects, i decided to quit. years later, i am sti will fucked up from the drugs. i suffer from anhedonia, decreased libido, head pressure, among other symptoms. the original anxiety is sti will present perhaps more so with an additional later of drug induced depression added to the mix. i have been trying to live as normally as possible with thes lasting side effects, but i am effectively faking my way through life. i am in graduate school to ki will some ti ame, but i enjoy very little. everything feels full and meaningless. every ti ame i wake up, the first thought is not again. how many ti ames must i repeat this draining, joyless day? they say you have to play the hand you re dealt in life. when is it ti ame to fold?	severe
aspergers,depression,anxiety and possible schizophrenic teen looking for a answer. i am some combo package when it comes to being all sourts of goofed up. for a long ti ame now people having been telling me to go to a metal hospital because i am suicidal. one person has stated they have seen people like me die because all the thoughts. it does not help being told to ki will myself at least once a day since around th grade and i am a junior now so the thoughts got to me around last year. i do not want to get help because people wi will think of me as a freak or a lunatic. i just need help please.	severe

i can not go on like this i stopped taking medication over months ago. my mom cleaned my apt last month because she was trying to help me and took away the remainder of my pi wills in fear that i might choose the easy way out again. i guess she was right in doing so. anyways, i have been feeling really low lately and i looked up my refi wills and turns out i have more refi will for a couple of medications. i know it is not wise but i plan to go tomorrow to get those refi wills, not because i plan to get better but because i really need a way out. i am just tired....of everything.	severe
why do i do this? little backstory to give you an idea, i have dealt with major depression and anxiety silently for many years until it lead to a suicide attempt almost a year ago. i went to therapy throughout the summer until i went back to school and have not been to therapy since. i really liked my therapist and i want to go back. the other night i wrote out a whole list of all the things i have been really struggling with since we last talked it is a pretty damn long list lol . i wrote out the list so i would remember it pretty bad memory loss from depression . after completing the list i told myself i would tell my mom the next day that i need to go back to see my therapist. instead i just went on without ever telling her and not planning anything. i have to tell my mom because therapy is expensive and insurance does not cover it what a joke so i would need her help financially. i do not know if it is the financial burden i feel like i am putting on my mom or that i am just afraid to bring this up to her and have her freak out that i am going to do something again. whatever it is i do not know why i can not just do this because i know it is what i need. and this is just another perfect example of all the issues going on in my mind. i do not know, just needed to vent a little and maybe get some advice or motivation to help with this.	severe
it is been over years and i have not healed i loved a girl very much. things ended not how i had i amagined they would. it was like a worst case scenario. my life has been a nightmare ever since. i had already been through tremendous pain before in life, but nothing compares to the pain of losing a girl you love. it took me over a year to stop throwing up regularly because of my twisted stomach. i panic non stop because of this girl. i have not talked to her in over three years. i think about her non stop every day. this panicking gets worse on weekends. i always have a suspicious belief that she is having sex with other guys, when in reality i know nothing about her. this suspicion gets worse on weekend nights when people are more likely to be out partying. the jealousy of me wanting sex with her is insane. i am sti will a virgin at . i wanted to lose it to her so badly. my life is turning into me living at home with my parents with no job for an eternity. i am very smart and handsome. it ki wills me when i look at my face and think about how this relationship failed. i am always told that girls like me, but i can not grow an attraction anymore.	severe
my depression keeps being ignored...they say it is just puberty ...i am ...that is all i can say my mother said that depression is just puberty and that my therapist is overreacting with my diagnosis...i am so i do not think it is puberty i was diagnosed with ocd, ptsd and depression year ago and it is only been getting worse since then. i live in student home at college not far away from home unfortunately and my mom calls me today and says yea...your depression is just your hormones during puberty. tell your therapist to stop overreacting because i have enough problems with my life already. ...of course i hung up and took pi wills because i felt a panic attack coming. i literally have nobody. my dad is abusive, egoistic man who does not care about anyone but hi amself and my mom. i have no friends because of social phobia and anorexia, depression etc...i guess they are all scared of me somehow. my grandma passed away, my grandfather is abusive too and everyone else is either dead or too far away. i am losing my mind and i need someone...i feel like attention seeker so that is why i always say i am fine and shit but i am not fine or okay...i started self harm again and i ended up on er last week. i did not tell this to anyone yet and i feel like shit. thank you to anyone who reads this or tries to help. you can just say hi....it would mean a lot 	severe

i am starting zoloft but feel hopeless i have been on a ssri before years ago and while it helped somewhat, it made me apathetic and more bored with life. however it worked great paired with my old adhd meds. i just feel so anxious and exhauted because i feel out of control and my psych would not prescribe adhd meds right now, my ocd and depression has been getting worse so i just accepted zoloft.. but i feel like i would not be satisfied with zoloft and my psychiatrist is literally going to get mad at me when she knows that.	severe

i have been extremely depressed for the past year and the one thing i had to look forward to was my vacation, which has now been cancelled and i do not know how i am supposed to handle everything anymore throwaway account because i am too much of a bitch to post on my main. i am years old, had to drop out of college after one year because i am too poor, have been working an extremely dead end job for the past six months and just do not know what to fucking do anymore. i went to college for one year but had to drop out because i could not afford it. i have zero friends, and my job is overnights for hours, four days on four days off and only pays mini amum wage. i am male and i work with five ladies who are all each over so there is zero fucking connection between them and me. i do not have a car yet so i am sti will stuck at this job for at least another couple of months until i can get one because i am getting carpooled right now. my only friend moved to mississippi a few years back and we have been growing more thistant and hardly have anything in common anymore. when i am not at work the only thing i want to do is sleep and i get very little enjoyment out of activities that i used to love, and on days i do not work it is hard to force myself to do anything. my parents are poor so they can not afford to put me on their health insurance and i can not afford it myself. the one thing i had to look forward to was a vacation to portland that i have been planning for over six months, but now due to all this coronavirus bullshit i have to reschedule. i can reschedule my plane tickets but my airbnb was booked outside of the refund date so there is dollars down the fucking drain. i do not know what i am supposed to fucking do anymore. that was the one fucking thing i had going for me and now that is been fucking taken away from me as well.	severe

feeling absoluetly worthless diagnosed with ocpd, and major depressive thisorder. i am writing this because i do not have access to proper psychotherapy, and i am not allowed to take medication as they have side effects. i am feeling absolutely worthless tonight, i want to sleep and not do anything. the only good thing about my whole week is the pizza i order on saturday, and that is the only motivation for me to keep fighting through the week. i am emotionally numb, i only feel low. i have lost friends, and currently have no friends at all due to me being so dull and quiet all the ti ame. i am always i ammersed in my thoughts, and i have no real talent or ambition of any sort. my teachers say i am a failiure and want me to get me to stop taking their classes i had excellent grades previously but due to my ocpd my grades fell and i can not concentrate in class hence resulting in answering wrong everyti ame they ask something. i see everyone around me having fun each day, hanging out, while i am just wasting my life away. i desire to sit in home all day, eat, and waste my life away and eventually die a mess. i dont feel sad, i feel slightly low. my parents think i am happy and my condition is getting better apart from some of the obsessions i have, but it is not true. i am breaking down emotionally, mentally, and physically. i can not take this anymore.	severe
my depression complexity here is my horror story my father was never in the picture. at age my mom had a new boyfriend and from ages he sexually harassed me, molested me, and verbally abused me calling me ugly, etc. when i told my mom, she kicked hi am out but i suppose my child subconscious hid the fact that he shortly after came back. i have been suffering depression ever since. low self esteem, antisocial behavior, miserable. it was not until my late teens that i would remembered what happened and why i was like this. fast forward to age i suffered a mental breakdown once being severely depressed for months. i was in a manic state for about a months ti ame. hospitalized twice within that month. a ti ame in which my subconscious decided to reveal something else eating at me. i remembered that at age i would sexually abused my half brother which was at the ti ame he has another father i feel sick. i feel like a monster. i also realize though that this was a result of the environment i was in but can not help but blame myself anyway. my mom is sti will with my stepfather and they have two sons. brothers whom i have to pretend i am okay because they do not know what he did to me. everyone that knows pretends it never happened. while i suffer silently and feel as if under water slowly drowning. i am now . i am a single mother of two children. what on earth do i do? the world seems to be crashing in on me.	severe
depression caused by anxiety. i am starting to develop depression which i had before i think it is being triggered by the constant anxiety that i feel. someti ames i do not want to get up just because i know i am going to have an anxiety attack that day. sleeping not being alive just sound so much better. it is like life is a game that i am tired of playing and just want to turn it off.	severe
i am trying to scale down my depression naps. i have chronic depression, and it makes me sleep a lot. i usually sleep about hours a night and then i nap up to hours a day. my therapist and i have been thiscussing this and we want to work on scaling them down. i am excited to try it, but the only problem is i have an extremely hard ti ame trying to move when i wake up. i have heard of people sniffing ammonia or squeezing a stress ball to get the blood flowing. any suggestions?	severe
i am seeing a doctor tomorrow, any advice? after putting it off for so long i finally made an appointment with my local gp regarding my mental health issues. i am and have fit the criteria for depression since i was i would say. i have experienced low mood, loss of interest in almost all activities i used to enjoy, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts not often . the suicidal thoughts tend to occur more in the winter ti ame, in the summer months i actually feel a bit better. i guess the main symptom is chronic apathy and hopelessness. it was rather manageable until october last year when i thiscovered some thisturbing news that i was adopted and that my biological father was a serial rapist who raped my biological mother. after finding this out i feel i have become a little nutty . my girlfriend became especially worried, as i would always pick fights with her and in her words become rather unstable . i wouldn t say i have become delusional, but i now very quickly assume the worst in people and spiral into a very bitter place at the slightest wrong doing. i just want some advice with what to say. i do not really like talking about my issues with strangers, it just feels really uncomfortable like i am somehow showing weakness. this applies especially as i am a man. another thing that scares me is talk of antidepressants. on the one hand i feel i could benefit from such a medication as a tool to get things going again, however the side effects also make me anxious. the loss of libido scares me, mainly the horror stories i hear of it never coming back after cessation. however what scares me more is the emotional hollowness a lot of people describe, that when they do feel happiness its somehow meh . i sti will feel really happy someti ames, but its very rare and temporary, and i do not want those moments to feel less special. i see these symptoms a lot online and on reddit even, with warnings that they wi will ruin your life and that you should only use them as a last resort. how true is this?	severe
ireven and venex xl hey. i did not know where else to go to ask but is there a difference between ireven mg and venex xl mg? i know it is the same dose but i was on ireven for the first month but i met a different doctor in the same practise to get the repeat prescription. i wish they told me there was a change because it makes me very anxious that i am changing brands because the first three weeks getting used to the drug was so horrible i do not want to go through with that again. sorry if this is not to the usual theme to this tread, tbh i did not read posts before asking so i am not expecting much but ty for reading this post because idk who to ask x edit been one this drug for two months not one	severe

i hate feeling good for a few days only to feel like shit the next. i really thought i was getting better. i am on mg of zoloft since december and have been seeing a therapist since august who is just an amazing lady. i can not express to you guys how much better these things made me. i exercised almost everyday. i restarted school and a new job and stuck with both i have a horrible history of quitting everything because i just lose the energy and motivation i was so happy. but now, it is the same again. i thought at my new job people actually liked me, but recently just found out everyone is blaming me for everything going wrong drawer shortage, bad review, truck not put away and talk behind my back. i thought i was not that bad....i guess i thought i felt like i belonged. to make matters worse i have a crush on one of the managers. rumor is he is screwing another manager but everyone thinks they are good together so it is okay. last shift i saw hi am he pretty much bad mouthed me in front of my coworkers and then ignored me the rest of the day. i called in today after having perfect attendance because i did not have the strength to go in. my friend was starting to accompany me to the gym, which turned out to be the stupidest choice ever because all she does is flaunt about how fit she is, making me feel like crap. i do not know if it is the bad weather or not getting to socialize go to school because of the cornavirus. or maybe my meds have stopped working again. i just want to die. i am so sick of everyone acting like they like me until they do not. i am sick of being happy only to feel like shit the next day and laying on thw couch all day just wanting to give up. i just hate this life. i just want something to actually work and actually work full ti ame.	severe
really sick and tired of waiting to turn to get a therapist basically live in a conflicted household, read my r ama post on living in a shelter to get part of the backstory. i am just tired of waiting to get a therapist because right now i can not get one and i really feel like a private not a community free therapist would help. and i am so sick and tired of my shitty life i ampacting every aspect of my life and turning me into a shitty negative person. i just do not know what to do, i only have friends i can rely on but i have talked about this with them before and it is feels like i have exhausted my resources. i have tried meditation, journaling, mindfulness, exercise, all that. and it did help....for a short while. but that nagging negativity is sti will always there.	severe
i wi will ki will myself i was strugglling with my depression for years now and theres just no way out. at some points i thought it would get better, i thought i found a way out, i thought i eli aminated the reason for my suffering but it is just that si ample. i am the reason for my suffering. it is my mind, my attitude, the character i have become in the last few years, unfortunately without me really realizing it. i think it is just too late for me and i just want it to end. i do not know exactly when or how but it wi will happen and nevertheless it scares me. this is a feeling which i never wish somebody to have. maybe this is the last post i wi will ever publish on the internet maybe not. the only thing that helps just a little bit someti ames is to come here and read about people who feel the same way, people who got the same fears, the same problems, which is of course a blessing and a curse at the same ti ame. i just hope everybody here gets ok i mean here in germany we say die hoffnung stirbt zuletzt hope dies at least but my hope died a long ti ame ago.	severe
 ronaszn hey guys i recently got diagnosed with depression and had my first therapy meeting a couple weeks ago. as many of you know, first therapy meetings do not give you coping strategies, but are more of an introduction to what is going on inside your head. with the coronavirus situation, i wi will probably not be able to attend therapy sessions for the next month or two. on top of that, my main coping strategy, the gym, is also out of the picture due to the situation. and even more, as a college student the job market does not look too promising out of college. the whole entire situation has cemented the feeling of hopelessness inside me, and i feel like i am almost getting punished for trying to get better. my mind is completely voided of any opti amism, and getting better does not seem achievable anymore. i just want to know what some of you guys are doing to get through this situation, and especially my gym rats out there, how you are getting through gyms being closed due to social thistancing .	severe

i have dealt with depression for over a year and i am seriously thinking to stop taking my meds life genuinely feels better now, my doctor told me to not stop taking the meds and you guys wi will probably tell me to do so, but life severely i amproved for me, my grades went from an average of to this session, i got a girlfriend who loves me as much as i love her, i have dedicated myself to things that are more i amportant in life, li amiting my videogame ti ame, starting working out a couple months ago, started to believe in god again and i feel that god is sending me a sign to stop my meds. i have stopped taking them for a week now and i have been lying to my mother that i took my meds. just wanted to share you this with you guys to tell you, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. love you all and i hope everyone that deals with that mental i willness wi will get out of it one day	severe
i am now and feel just as awful as i did last year. for starters not a single one of my friends remembered my birthday, so that one was rough. but otherwise, around a little over a year ago i quit my job i have the luxury of not needing to worry about finances right now , and then a month later i entered therapy and started trying medications. every medication of the ish i have tried has had no effect, and i mean none literally. i have also gotten absolutely nowhere with therapy, i even tried a couple different therapists this year, because i was told that if you are not getting anywhere with your therapist it might just be because you do not mesh with them. it is hard to keep being hopeful. it is almost i ampossible these days to i amagine a future where i do not feel so awful all the ti ame. it is been a bad birthday, and a bad life.	severe
my uni just shut until at least third semester end of april i have seasonal depression, this year has been extra bad, thought i was coming to the end of it. now my uni shut, my sports club sessions trips are cancelled and i have realised how much i rely on both of those things for happiness. what makes it worse is that i would not even be able to see my boyfriend more than once a week. i should probably get some coping mechanisms that are not physical have the possibility of not being available but have no idea where to start	severe
i can not help myself anymore i have been dealing with depression for years now.. and in it is early stages when i would get insecure about looks i was able to make myself laugh by screaming randomally if i had the chance to i would fuck you! it made me stop crying and i would be able to laugh my sadness off. i learned to hate myself because of people around me that got mad at me for small mistakes. although i know it is because of them, i can not get myself to stop hating myself because of mean people. it became a part of me. it is like that piece of glass that gets stuck on your foot...and you step on it pushing it further and your skin just grows over it. i then met this guy that made me really happy, and he told me he liked me and i was going to tell hi am i liked hi am too.. the whole ti ame he had a girlfriend. i found out through a friend and at first it did not hurt me. i just went eh it is okay, but then i was going through a bad ti ame and i noticed that i had to start every conversation with hi am, and that he steadily started ignoring me. we used to play games together, but i noticed he stopped playing with me and stopped talking to all his friends all together and only focused on his girlfriend which i understand. the problem is he started being meaner for no reason and questioning everything i said. i found myself sad again and crying daily for a total of now a month. i am crying as i am writing this portion, i thought he was a good friend, i thought i had someone to rely on when i am sad. he helped me through a lot and we told each other everything. it is hard to move on and love someone else. it is harder to love someone when you can not love yourself. i have been having suicidal thoughts for three weeks in a row now, and i can not bring myself to ask for help from my friends. they do not take me seriously when i say something they just pass it off or tell me i sound like an eboy. i understand that, but it really hurts when you re begging for help.	severe

lonely someti ames i get really lonely. i just want some attention is all. i can not take this feeling. i have a great boyfriend but because of this coronavirus he can not even come over. i feel so alone and all i want is friends to talk to and comfort me. why is this so much to ask for?! i just want to be normal. i hate having depression. meds help but not all the ti ame. i just...can not take this...	severe
 years since i was diagnosed... i just turned a few days ago and it is hitting me that i have been depressed since i was . i just dropped out of university because i do not give a shit about anything. i feel like my whole life has been a waste and i have nothing to show for it. i have tried tons of medications, therapy, and inpatient treatment but i am sti will like this. my self esteem and motivation is so low that i feel jealous of anyone who is doing better than me aka all my friends. self comparison is ruining my life. i am so bitter. it is so fucking frustrating being clinically depressed for years and never being able to change long term. depression stole my youth from me and my life would have turned out so differently without it. i do not think anything or anyone can help me.	severe
you know therapy is so weird so many people go to therapy i do too but my therapist does not really all help me all we do is talk about my problems and she tell me something i already knew just using bigger words. why am i paying someone for something i can get from random people online oh wait that is right my anxiety amp depression solving pi wills that come with there own set of problems but again i do not really need a therapist for that my own family doctor can proscribe those so why am i wasting money on this shit it is so frustrating the therapist is only really there to in a roundabout way tell you to solve your own shit in a healthy way. but who came up with what is healthy for me i just want to cut loose and break everything in her office smash every piece of glass and rip everything thing apart and maybe during that moment maybe if only for a small amount of ti ame i wi will forget. forget those around me that left or those that are dying that i can not help or those who for reasons can not even remember my name after knowing me my entire life. but that is not a healthy way to really deal with my problems i guess or at least that is what she tells me.	severe
i really need to rant this is probably what is going through everyone is head rn but i need to just shout this out into the void. this stupid virus has me at probably my lowest point in a long ti ame. i am in college, all my classes got moved to online i do not do well online, the tests are done using a program that can tell if you re cheating it literally just records you and even your eye movements and the professor can just watch you and that alone stresses me out. i am terrified i am going to lose my job because there is talk of closing down the school and all it is services and guess what i work for the school as a tutor. and i have an apartment and i can not just break the lease and move home with my family because that is not a thing with student apartments they wi will just charge my co signer which is my aunt and then she wi will be mad at me and never trust me again. and i am obviously living in the apartment because i have to pay for it but all my roommates are gone and i have nobody which makes my depression worse. my mom was honestly worried i would attempt again but this ti ame there would be nobody to save me. i thought i would be okay here because i have been going to therapy and i was doing much better before the whole virus thing and i was making i amprovements so i thought it would be beneficial to continue that but i found out that they are closed indefinitely because they are also a part of the school. i feel lost and helpless. i looked into online therapy and it is so expensive. my college is in a super small town so there are not many mental health professionals in the area and when you consider the fact that i do not have a car there are even fewer to choose from and i would need to be able to talk to someone who can deal with my multitude of problems anxiety, depression, and ocd i just have so many unanswered questions and so much stress and the one thing i was relying on is completely gone i feel lost. i guess if anyone has any recommendations for getting this therapy thing situated temporarily please let me know otherwise thanks for reading.	severe
calls from the void i have been suffering with severe depression since childhood but the past months have just been almost unbearable. i was contemplating suicide daily. i then moved countries but could not adjust, lost my relationship in the process, attempted suicide but rationally stopped and returned home i ammediately. between then and now i just can not stop the thoughts, every day i wake up to my inner voice convincing me to end it all. i can temporarily avoid it by keeping myself occupied but it is exhausting and i feel like i am losing the battle. my anxieties are getting worse, my sleep is almost non existent and the thoughts come to me the moment i am not busy. quarantine is also forcing me to be alone with my thoughts which is making it twice as difficult. i have therapy but it isnt working and my dr isnt wi willing to prescribe anti depressants until i have completed therapy. is there any advise for situations like this, how are people coping in si amilar situations, is this normal ?	severe
been depressed for a long ti ame and not sure how to get out of it i have had issues since my ti ame in the service but they got worse after my wife admitted to having an affair and walked out about a year ago. i did the normal self pity party, crying, no sleep, barely eating, drinking too much, etc sti will kinda do that but even after i started to wise up nothing seems to go right. everything i do seems to backfire on me some way. my best friend walked out on me, i left my closest friends besides her when i got out of the military, my family has always been the type where we do not talk about emotions, and the people i have actually opened up to since she left ended up talking shit behind me back and laughing about me. job wise i do not really have any marketable ski wills in the private sector, can not find a job that pays more than mini amum wage. i am staying with family right now but i can not seem to save up any money because whenever i do something happens, either my truck breaks down or my ex is asking me to pay for her latest speeding ticket, her groceries, gas, etc and for whatever reason i give her the cash. i mean i know why i do it, it is because i love her. we have had rough ti ames in the past and when we were broke and barely scrapping by, there were days i did not eat to make sure my daughters and her had enough. i just want something good to happen or at least something i know how to handle. i have been applying for jobs with miltary contracters in iraq, syria, afghanistan so that i can at least have a decent paying job that makes sense i have worked in factories, construction, private security, agriculture and had a hard ti ame adjusting. my transition out of the service was not as smooth as i would have liked and was part of the problem with my relationship. so what the hell should i do? i have got girls keeping me here and love them to death but at the same ti ame i am now anchored by my ex and more specifically her asshole of a boyfriend, who happens to live in an area with no jobs that fit my ski willset at all. so i am stuck being broke, unable to go after opportunities because i wi will not walk away from my kids. i have thought about therapy but no money for it and the va is too far away to do it.	severe
had my first therapy appointment after a planned attempt. suggested medication but have some concerns. i have been kind of in the battle alone for the most part around years. after a pretty bad breakdown where i had a plan to commit but was talked down lashing out at the person and possibly ending that relationship i decided to finally get help. went in and towards the end was suggested i get evaluated further for medication since it is gone untreated for so long and run rampant. i really love the idea that i could be fixed with some si ample medicine but i have concerns it wi will change me in ways i would not want. i really want to nuke the bad side of me to oblivion, but i do not know if it would be worth losing the good sides full potential. i am really afraid i wi will just become a different person completely and lose my personality. any advice testi amonies or comments? thank you	severe
forced to quit meds because of anxiety to call doctor. how to mini amise the stopping effects? been on vanlafaxine for months, but my doctor took vacation for few weeks now and due to quarantine my visit to other doctor has been canceled. i finished my meds today. i need to call the doctor to ask her to give prescription but i just freeze when i need to call someone. for days i took of my usual dose, and for last days i took of my daily dose. i know that i would not be able to call the doctor to get more meds so i wi will have to live like this for now. i got some blood pressure stabilising meds to help with side effect i had to quit meds for two days before and it resulted it really high blood pressure . i also sti will have some bromazepam for anxiety. anything else that i could do to avoid nasty side effects?	severe
how a near death experience worsened my depression trigger warning, very descriptive of my frame of mind. last summer, after tubing at my lake, i was swi amming around when i got very cold. i figured it was because i had not eaten yet that day so i got out of the water and started to walk up the stone steps to my porch. i was sti will really cold but my legs began to grow so heavy that i could not stand. i collapsed on the steps and my body was now on fire, bursting into hives that made the rest of my skin shrink in on itself. i remember my mom dragging me up the stone steps and standing me up next to our gri will while she went to get benadryl, i do not remember fainting or hitting my head on the gri will. but i did. i eventually came to half consciousness about five minutes later, unable to move, talk, or even hear. the heavy heat had lifted but there was this cold left behind. i felt so light and my nerves were coated in a sort of darkness that blinded them. i could not hear anything but a slight ringing and some white static. later, my mom would tell me my stepdad was shaking me and calling my name while she was patting my face. she also said that i was nearly completely blue and barely breathing, that she would have started cpr soon. she thought i was going to die. but all of that means nothing to me compared to what i saw. they do not lie when they say there is a light. granted it was not warm, nothing was actually. but it was beautiful. at first just the sun, but then after filtering through green leaves directly above me, it became this rippled net of picturesque peace. i remember thinking that if this was it, if this was how i died, after doing the last thing i loved, looking up at leaves, that would be ok. in that moment, i truly wanted to die. and it is odd because recovery units and suicidal pamphlets tell us that we just want the pain to be gone. so much so that dying seems like the only way out. they make it seem like we wish for some parathise on the other side where chaos is nonexistent. but they are wrong. before this incident i was already diagnosed with severe ocd and mdd. medicated for both. all the coping mechanisms. all the positive mental attitude. all the medication and therapy, could not have saved me from death. they say none of us are meant to die at our own hands. i thisagree. i think that some of us wander this earth dying a little everyday, knowing there is no point. no end. so what of this one that people found horrific? death was no end, it is completion. i go back to this incident often. in some sick way it comforts me. the idea of being able to rest eternally after the war that is my mind. i do not have a bad life. many people would ki will to have my life. and i sti will wish they could take it. but i am sti will going, because i know that, one way or another, i wi will get there.	severe

is anyone on remeron? mirtazapine i have been on mg of mirtazapine for years now, i have gotten to the point where i am extremely tired everyti ame i take it, i can sleep for hours. my psychiatrist ignores me everyti ame i tell hi am when i researched the pi will it said that after a while on the same does our body gets used to it, if you do not up the dose our body wi will get extremely tired. it is almost like he does not care, but maybe that is my anxiety over researching, he is the doctor after all. i also am on a second antidepressant trintellix i want to get off the mirtazapine but last ti ame i tried i suffered through thiscontinuation syndrome, it was so terrible. has anyone ever been on mirtazapine? have you experienced this aswell	severe
it finally happened, my libido is gone i have been taking paxil paroxetine for a while now. started with mg and now i have cli ambed all the way up to mg over years, where i managed to find some peace. i tried going down to mg but my life got a bit thisastrous so i went back up to mg. after a while, i was out of pi wills so i had my psychiatrist prescribe me more. except this ti ame the pharmacy was out of paxil mg pi will, so they gave me an equivalent medication of a different brand, which had a dose of mg pi will. i already have some paxil left over so i am using half a paxil mg this paxil substitute mg for a total of mg of paroxetine. for some reason this change made things better even though the dose was the same. it felt like i was taking a higher dose. i made sure to double check the numbers and they did sum up to mg. but i started sleeping for hours a day. i started feeling nothing looking at revealing clothing. i tried all kinds of suggestive i amages and i would get no response. it is as if i became asexual overnight. it really hurt my overall happiness because it was a way of stress relief for me. this happened about week after i started taking paxil along with its substitute so i am definitely sure the culprit is either the substitute or the si amultaneous use of the two. i know the internet is not the best place for medical advice but i was wonder if someone had a si amilar experience. my next appointment is over months later. even if it was sooner, i doubt i would be able to talk about my sexual life because i am single and i do not know what i am supposed to say. help, i can not masturbate! would leave a weird i ampression. anyways, thanks for reading so far. i wi will keep taking my meds because i have no other alternative and i do not want to get the brain zaps and other withdrawal symptoms. i just hope this lack of libido or ssri induced ed is not a permanent thing. tl dr took substitute meds, became a softer guy	severe

so many reasons to be depressed i do not believe in karma, faith, god, or high power or whatever of that sort of thing... but i can not handle this anymore, life has been so cruel towards me, i gave everything i have and sti will made progress... main reasons behind my depression are .abusive parents . i have brothers and a sister... brothers are so needy and annoying despite me being the youngest, same for my sister... i am going to talk about the last one at the end . i am an atheist in a religious country, which means if they know i do not follow their religion i will be as good as dead . my job is so crap, the boss and coworkers are unfortunately even worse . no friends . no girlfriend . the only brother who cares about me died of an i willness months ago. i was suicidal before he even dies, after his death i am not able to function in anything...i just want to experience peace for once since i was born, guess death was always a better option i am typing this as tears are running through my cheeks just before sleeping, since i have none to talk to in real life i had to vent here... when even the family is not trustworthy its the moment that i made sure that i can not trust anyone who knows me personally. i am exhausted just because i exist...	severe
for those on lexapro, should i ask my doctor about switching? can not sleep through the night, have intense nightmares. i was diagnosed with moderate major depression a few months ago and my doctor prescribed me lexapro. i started on mg. with that since i was learning how to atart taking medication on a daily basis, i would forget on occasion and i would wake up in the middle of the night yelling and thrashing. i accidently hit my boyfriend in the face in my sleep. my doctor increased my dosage to mg about months ago. after the increase, i started having these horrible night sweats which was not happening before. only the dreams on occasion. now, i wake up several ti ames during the night from sweating and nightmares no matter how low i keep my ac. overall, i am doing a lot better compared to the way i was functioning before the medication, but the sweating is making me unable to sleep and keeping me up for hours. i could go to bed at pm and not wake up feeljng fully rested when i wake up at am. i actually have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow and i plan to tell hi am about this of course, but i wanted to see if anyone else had si amilar experiences with lexapro.	severe

dealing with major depressive does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with major depressive? i am years old and i have had depression since i was around . everyday is a challenge and i am at the point in which i feel like i am losing myself. my closest friends live in different countries and i am emotionally exhausted from holding onto all of my problems without talking about them. i feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself, but my family would be thistraught over me hurting myself and they have done a lot for me so i am resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that i do not feel anymore. cereal	severe
every day for the last months i have thought of ki willing myself. i keep waking up with an i ammediate dread having to be here. nothing brings me joy anymore and the things that seem promising quickly turn into bitter thisappointment. i dont want to go through the motions anymore. my life isnt objectively bad, but subjectively i am miserable and severely depressed. ive never really planned on life past and i dont want to grow old. i dont fit it anywhere and i am constantly ignored by the few that catch my interest. my life is gray and i can not i amagine a future where i am truly happy, everything is so fake.	severe
i was told it gets better, years later and it just got numb. so first of all, i do not know if this is a rule or not, but i have never been to a doctor is and actually got confirmed to have depression, i have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, i have not left the house for years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that i had not left the house in years. even before that, i did not receive a high school education as i spent it all, you guessed it, in my house. there was a small portion in my life where i actually had friends, years ago, i was active, fun , enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally i was sti will in the dumps. most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. of course my friend at the ti ame tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure i was coming out of my shell so to say. so of course i fucked that up, i made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and i punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. sti will have not seen them to this day, besides one, my so. somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit. i punished myself a lot, i would cut myself, i would punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. my so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. these days i do not get the wi will to do so anymore. ever since then, nothing, for a whole years, most of it i did not even spend ti ame with my mother and younger sister. maybe i was sti will punishing myself. i had few hobbies or even things to do, though i did not fully enjoy any of it, i was starting to feel pretty emotionless. towards the end i actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister. it was going fairly well for me, i was starting to look at the bright side, i sti will never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison. but then my sister did something unspeakable, something i do not think i could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. i was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. ever since i have been weird around my sister, finding it almost i ampossible to connect and angry at my mother. so now, i just feel numb, i really do not know what to do, i have been trying to forgive and forget but it is i ampossible. i have been trying to go outside but i almost have panic attacks just thinking about it someti ames. i am back to the prison with nothing to do but wait. tl dr after many years, things started to look good until family trouble, now it is worse than ever.	severe
chronic harm ocd sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice? hello. depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe harm ocd. but since my relationship ended months ago, i have been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. it is like i am living in a di amensional world. nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. i used to be quite creative but it is just taken a nose dive. any work i do is utterly awful and i am amazed i am not been kicked off projects i work freelance . i wake up and i just want to be dead, quite honestly. in fact in the last few weeks i have even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where i am almost in tears from the weight of everything. i am getting help with a therapist and am on an ssri low dose anti psych. and i have taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. i have started cycling again just done miles today in fact . but i sti will feel utterly wretched and everything i do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain i am going through. the years ahead fi will me with dread i am in my s . with my harm ocd i have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. i would just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality for me, anyway i would just like to hear from people who know what is like and have helped themselves.	severe
i went to the hospital because i was having really bad panic attacks, and theycontinued in there. i ended up collapsing and the nurse who was trying to help me up said, you re attention seeking. . i literally broke down crying and asked to go home, another nurse was watching me while i was crying saying he wanted to keep me longer, as i kept saying i wanted to go home and he said i was wasting his ti ame by making hi am watch over me while i asked to cry for a while before leaving. i have never been through anything like this especially when in a hospital and when i was so weak and my chest and throat hurting so much from a panic attack. i just wanted to vent, that you for reading.	severe
i tried to ki will myself yesterday and want to quit the meds, long post so i was at a party and got drunk, not i can not walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. i just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. i thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. i miss them so much. ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this ti ame it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i want to die. this had never happened to me before. so there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. then i just jumped. i tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? but my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it. my parents came and people tried to help. only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and i am sure they wi will thissapear now, except for the one, but he can not take care of me like i need it. i need someone to be there all the ti ame and i guess that is not fair. i guess that is not fair, because that is how i lost my friends. they didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i wi will convince myself i am just bothering. i wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the ti ame or the wi will to help me like i needed anymore. now i dont want to take the meds because i truly thought i was better. turns out i was just drugged all the ti ame and it feels so fake now. i thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. that i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it thisappear . ive always been able to fight, its harder, yes, but i think i can make it.	severe

depersonalization derealization i am currently on zoloft and lamictal for anxiety. few months ago i stated having panic attacks, but they resolved with zoloft. yesterday something very freighting happened to me. as i was talking to my daughter is teacher i felt i was slowly thisconnecting from the surroundings. i was forgetting where i was, who i was talking to. this horror lasted hours. after i finally took klonopin the symptoms stopped. i am relatively a healthy person. i wi will be seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is no other underling condition. did this ever happened to you?	severe
i am afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me. so my depression is very treatment resistant. i have lost track of how many different meds and med combos i have tried. recently it was suggested that i try tms transcranial magnetic sti amulation , which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. my psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but i have been putting off actually making the appointment because i am scared. you know how someti ames people do not like taking meds because they make them feel like they are not themselves anymore like they make them feel numb or empty? it is sort of like that, except in reverse. i have had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and i literally can not i amagine what it would be like if it actually got better. would i sti will feel like me? i know that things would i amprove, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. it is been a constant for most of my life and i do not know who i would be without it. tl dr i am scared to try something that could work because i do not know who i would be without my depression.	severe
first therapy sessions sliding scale? hi i am going to be seeing a therapist for the first ti ame in a while, at the urging of my partner. for a long ti ame, i have felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so i am just now taking my situation more seriously. i can not continue on like this and i know it. so i am going. my problem is that i have mini amal insurance dollars for the year for mental health . my new therapist works on a sliding scale, but i do not know how much to pay. she is given me dollars as an option, then i got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what i thought was fair. i might be able to get on my partner is insurance at some point, but i have no idea when, i am now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because i can feel myself getting close to a breaking point. i am so sorry if this is not supposed to be posted on this subreddit. this was the only one i knew have known for a while thank you in advance for any advice you might have even if it is to delete this 	severe
better days coming. so i have struggled with depression on and off my whole life. i graduated recently and was lucky enough to land a pretty decent job. however, since i have moved and started the job i have relapsed heavy. i know it is common for people to be lonely when making a big move and being in a new environment. i tried to end it all when i was in hs and told myself i would never go back to that place. i decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and i am glad i did. i would not bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. well today i just got an offer at a company that i have wanted to work at since i started college! and best of all it is back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. i know i wi will be happy there, more so than this place. and i wi will be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short years. i am hoping this was the change that i was looking for. i made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. i start next month! btw i signed up for betterhelp for my therapy. it is not for everyone but i am very shy and have had bad experiences with psychiatrist and counselors. it was just more excuses i made to not get help.	severe

i secretly do not want my antidepressant medication to work why? because if it does work, then i have to leave my depressed self behind. i am so used to being depressed, it is really comforting. not talking to anyone for weeks, not leaving the house for weeks, not eating any food, staying up late every night, not doing self care things like showering, brushing teeth, etc. honestly i do not want to get better, i want to stay depressed if that makes sense. at this point i feel like i am too lazy to get better, i do not want to do the extra steps to get better, i am exhausted trying in life. anyone else relate?	severe

where wi will i end up if i know i can not deal with life and do not want to ki will myself. i have suffered with depression my entire life and never did much to overcome it early on when i should have. i wi will turn soon and i have been addicted to porn since i was . i used porn as a safe coping mechanism so that i wouldn t have to deal with anything in life i amproving social ski wills and having friendships, taking risks, developing hobbies, talking to girls and dating, going to college, traveling. ive done none of these things. i have had a few menial jobs and have an apartment. that is it. now i have no job, i am a virgin and i have no friends. i just quit watching porn a month ago, but i am more depressed than i have ever been. this is because when i cut my coping mechanism being porn addiction out of your routine, reality hit me like a brick wall. everything is bubbling to the surface and i am fully overwhelmed by the fact that i have completely wasted my young life. i see absolutely no positive reason to move forward. i have never felt this close to suicide being the only way out before. i am seeing shrinks about my problems and got put on meds recently this month. therapy is not helping and you know meds just numb the pain a bit. they do not do anything to i amprove me without me trying to i amprove myself. but it is gotten to the point where i have no desire to i amprove myself at all!! i can not get out of bed, can not eat. can not go outside. i have no passion to do anything. i know i can not commit suicide but i do not want to move or think. i have been in a crisis unit at a local hospital years ago and it did nothing to help me. all they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for weeks straight before they released me. all this did for me was numb the pain with medication and i was just as unhappy as i was before i went in. so my question is what happens when you do not want to ki will yourself, but you can not deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? is there a place where they wi will put you where you do not have to leave your bed? psych ward or something? i want to be put away forever. i can not deal with the uphi will battle i wi will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. i do not have any strength left to i amprove myself at all. i do not want to be released from the care of others. where do they put someone like me at his point. any advice?	severe

just got prescribed prozac. could i sti will have small moderate quantities of alcohol? hi, i was just prescribed prozac today and i wondering if i could sti will drink smoke while on it. i am in college and enjoy a drink every once in a while, as well as getting drunk someti ames smoking at parties though not as often as i used to. i understand that depression meds intensify the effects of alcohol marijuana. if i were to have smaller doses than i usually consume i.e. li amiting myself to one drink at all ti ames would that be a problem, or should i avoid other substances altogether? thank you 	severe
 tw i asked for help in another subreddit, and the replies made me go through with an attempt. i was just asking if it was okay for me to ask my s o to not leave me alone because i was severely depressed and afraid i would do something to myself. the replies were horrible. in the post, i already had called myself selfish and a burden for wanting this from hi am, and people just kept reaffirming that and telling me how inconsiderate i was and how i would destroy his life. anyways, i am trying to be okay and safe now after spending the last few days vomiting and confused and exhausted but i guess the point of this post is to raise awareness to venting in safe spaces. not everyone is going to be understanding, specially through an anonymous profile. it can be seriously damaging.	severe

i was, and am, scared of getting better before i was out i am ftm i was severely depressed for years, and was even suicidal for a while. i hated it, all i wanted was to feel okay most days and when i came out, it was like a flip switched in my brain. i was not just okay, i was genuinely happy most days. i had not felt that good since i was at the absolute oldest. in some ways, i felt like a completely different person i became more empathetic, my grades went up, i had more motivation then maybe ever before, i completely stopped doing self harm, including pinching, which is something i started doing as a form of self harm when i was around , but i was sti will me in the sense of personality. for once, i truely felt like myself. that said though, the bad days became so much worse i was not used to it, it was not my norm anymore. i am sti will so grateful to have been able to experience that, to know what it felt like to function normally. when things first started to get better trough, that was exactly what i was afraid of. that it would be worse when things got bad, and if it got really bad again, i was not sure if i even would be able to recover. to an extent, i was right. now, the period of constant okayness is ending. i am having less and less good days, and it is awful. i am having more breakdowns than i did when i was suicidal, and when it happens now, i almost always get really close to passing out, and that never happened before. i just want this to be over and i do not care if that happens because i get better again, of if it is because i get used to it again, i just want this to stop.	severe

i do not know how to deal with this... i have been struggling recently again with my depressions. it hit me very hard during the last month. my results in school are lacking behind, i messed up with a girl and issues with my father resurfaced. this all pushed me back in my dark hole, which i thought i left behind years ago. escaping seems i ampossible and every day feels more and more pointless. this entire depression feels like a parasite that is stuck with me and my body and no matter what i do there is no way getting rid of it. i can not value myself and i am self critical to the extent that it could almost be self hatred. every ti ame i get into a situation that could be good for me i avoid it, persons that could be good for me i push them actively away until they do not want to be with me anymore. the cold realization that i missed an opportunity or chance comes unfortunately always too late. the feeling of not going anywhere in my life increased drastically over the last month. especially the failed relationship with this girl devastated me. it was the first ti ame in a long ti ame that i tried letting someone into my life, with which i have big problems since my dad left years ago. this topic of my dad is my big trauma in life and i m so scared of turning out like hi am. this hurts me so much, because i see her every day, reminding me of my failure to keep something good around. things just feel pointless and meaningless at the ti ame. i am unable to do things and isolation became a bigger part of my life during these last weeks. the only ways out at the moment are getting drunk and doing excessive amounts of sport. for the first ti ame in years this feeling of not wanting to continue with all this.	severe

venting this is really just venting because i have no one to talk to. i have been depressed for about years, little moments of hope and temporary happiness here and there when i briefly connect with people. but eventually my depression takes over again and the people i connected with start perceiving me differently, i have been told by a lot of them that i become too negative. not really my intention it is not like i am choosing to be sad all the ti ame. the other thing that has been keeping me going is being good in school, up until last fall i was in graduate school which in hindsight was not really a good idea because that is when everything started getting worse. because of additional stress and my inability to make any friends. i failed out of classes and got thismissed from my school, was too embarrassed to tell anyone including my family so i just shut down and attempted suicide by taking pi wills, obviously it did not work. i knew it was not the most effective way but i was just done with everything and did not have another option at the moment. i do not think therapy is going to help me, yes venting someti ames feels nice but it is not going to change my perspective about life, i have never been an opti amistic happy person. i do not see a happy future for myself, i am not attractive at all, not really in shape, apparently not as smart as i thought i was, no one is ever going to give a crap about me let alone love me. i am just not lovable. someti ames i i amagine what it would be like if i was a completely different person with people in my life who actually love me and care about me, it is like day dreaming. and someti ames i pretend that my pi willow is a person who loves me enough to actually sleep next to me. pathetic and borderline crazy i know. it just keeps hurting because everywhere i look i see happy people, happy couples, people with perfect lives and i know i wi will never have that	severe
zoloft dose hi everyone! i just got diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my doctor prescribed zoloft. her recommendation was to start taking it at mg the first week and up the dose to mg from then on. not going to lie, i am a little worried about the dose. i see that a lot of people are starting out as low as mg. this makes me feel a little worried that my doc is recommendation is maybe too high? just looking for opinions or maybe a reference before i jump into this. i have never taken antidepressants so i do not know what to expect and i have heard horror stories about the side effects that make me second guess taking medication.	severe
advanced therapies and memory loss i have had depression for years. i have ehlers danlos thisease which is absolutely cripplingly painful physically, and pretty much ensures my brain chemistry wi will be screwed up for the rest of my life. my depression wi will be severe and wi will never end. this is not a your life temporarily sucks but could get better depression, but a depression i was born into and am basically fated to for the rest of my life just because the way the thisease works. it fucks up several systems of my body and there is very little i can do about it. i have done the basic drugs, i have been for the behavioural therapy, and i might as well have been eating tic tacs. now the doctors want to go for electric shock therapy but warn me that i might lose some of my memory as a side effect. i spent nine years in university literally crawling to class in pain to get where i am now. i do not want to lose any of my memories because all those ti ames i spent in tears in class trying to make it through the hour before i could break down in agony would be wasted if i can not remember them. i really would rather die than lose what is in my head, and that is what they are telling me i might lose with ect. if i lose my memories i can not work and i am homeless, and then what use am i? i am feeling like no matter which i turn i lose. what has been everybody is experience with memory loss and ect? i can not afford to lose the nine years of science degree. if that is in question at all, i am not going to do it, just accept my fate and fade.	severe
anyone else take wellbutrin and if so do you get side effects i weaned off celexa and onto wellbutrin because after being on celexa for about years pri amarily for anxiety in the last year or two my motivation to do anything has dropped so i wanted to find something that could better help my depression and i amprove my motivation. i have been on the wellbutrin about a month and a half and after the first ish weeks of which i weaned off the celexa, by early to mid afternoon on most days i now crash with fatigue and exhaustion. also get mild nausea, someti ames a long with the exhaustion and someti ames by itself. also i can not say the wellbutrin is actually making a positive difference with my depression and motivation but i do sleep thru the night virtually every night which i did not do on the celexa. the wellbutrin has also caused intense dreams but never nightmares. in all honesty i am feeling more depressed due to the fact that i physically feel like crap by evening. really wonder if the fatigue and exhaustion is side effects from the wellbutrin or if its withdrawal symptoms from being off the celexa.	severe

depression turning into rage i have to admit it. someti ames my depression explodes into rage. it scares me how angry i get. and after the explosion of rage i become even more depressed. because well i was just a horrible person then i cry about it. and honestly, saying sorry does not help. and it pushes people away from me. it scares me so much that i self isolate. i do not want anyone to know what an ugly person i am on the inside. then i get angry because no one wants to hang out. it is a stupid vicious cycle. and i sit here and cry which does nothing either. i have been in and out of therapy for my depression and rage for over years. nothing helps. i was originally a psychology major and actually have a masters in professional counseling. i left being a counselor because i stopped believing in the ability of it to help me and others. well that and i worked with abused children and this made my depression and rage reach heights that i had never had before or since. counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, all of it does not help. i am currently coming off my epilepsy pi wills. i have been told that it is possible that i am bipolar instead of just depressed. that my epilepsy pi wills might have been covering up manic phrases, i am scared because of this. i live alone. i live in fear that i am going to have a seizure. this is activating my depression which means i am raging all the ti ame as well. i just want the fear, anxiety, depression and rage to leave me alone. why am i sio fucked up?	severe

nothing in my life sparks joy like it used to i have had depression for as long as i can remember. but for the most part i was always able to see into the future and motivate myself to cheer up and get excited for what i can become. even if it was a short period if satisfaction. although, for the past few months, i can not shake off this feeling of emptiness and sadness. i feel so hollow and lonely and worthless. as i am writing this i finally realized i probably need professional help but for some reason, i am fighting myself over whether i should reach for help or not. i am not comfortable with asking for help, i always love to be the one helping. though i guess theres a small part of me hoping that someone would reach out, despite the fact that i try so hard to hide my true struggle with my emotions and act like i am laid back and have no care in the world. i am always going against what i need. i want a way out of my counter productive mindset. its ruining my school work and my aspiration to achieve what i want in my life. a few years ago i was upset how i couldnt find any love interest. but as ti ame passed i grew to realize that is not what i really wanted. so i took up some hobbies, which until recently also have lost their ability to give me joy. and even my long term life goals arent making me any happier. theres nothing i want or hate. i am just sad and empty.	severe
i ampulsive self harm hi everyone. i am f and i have a mild personality thisorder and i suffer from what i think is depression and anxiety. i am not just depressed, though, just this morning i got inadequately angry for spi willing water. i lift up from depression occasionally to feel other lovely emotions like anxiety, fear and already mentioned anger. anyway, i have troubled relationship with my family, mother particularly, and i have been always overly attached to my partners and picked them so they would appreciate such a trait high level of attachement rather than get thiscouraged by it. my current partner is my greatest motivation to get better, but i do not observe much progress even after a year and half of therapy. biggest problem is that he is been a witness to several self harming sessions of mine, because i am probably seeking either for attention or help or both. i have read that most people who self harm cut themselves on arms and someti ames other places, but when i lose my mind i start frantically scratching myself, pulling hair, biting any flesh that comes near my head or hit cutting with a knife and i have the urge to stab a knife through my heart. has anyone experienced this? also it happened once in a presence of my parents very recently and those are the last people i wanted to know about this. i have episodes of elaborated cutting or pinching to relieve the tension as well, but when i really get lost i honestly have no idea what is the purpose of those scary fits other than seeking for help or attention. how is it possible that i lose control so much?	severe
i am so god damn tired.... hello... the title, basically. i should probably use a throw away but i do not care anymore. i am going to warn this is mostly me bitching and whining, i am really not that interesting. to start, last year, my mom and cat died the same month. my cat actually died the week of my mother is funeral. i was very, very close with her. she was he entire reason i went to college for a degree. my cat was there for me since i was a little kid, losing her was like losing a piece of myself... before i had a brain injury. she was all that was left to tie me to normality. sure you could argue nobody is normal, but that is not easy to hear when you re bullied relentlessly for being weird. i actually had to leave high school it got so bad. to top all this shit off, i got denied thisability for the second ti ame, so now i have to wait another two years just to fucking hear no again. i submitted two fucking banker boxes of my medical problems, two! i also need to deal with voc rehab since they helped me but i can not fucking work with my thisability, i have shadowed two different jobs and failed horribly. i barely finished college despite my longest day being hours, with two of that being a break period. i feel useless and hopeless. i am , poor, and draining my bf of his money. i just want to sleep and not wake up. or have cybernetics let me have a cyborg body so my muscles and nerves are not as weak and painful as an year old. i am not going to do anything, mostly because i do not even have the energy to attempt. but i am also stuck in hell of struggling to sleep despite being exhausted all the ti ame. i wish i was normal, i wish i was not a fucking leach on society. i want to help so fucking bad but every doctor i have seen has said i can not work. anxiety on phone, can not do si ample math, have a seizure thisorder so lots of places would not want to hire me for that risk, they just have to clai am something else to not be sued can not drive, and can not lift more than lbs. i also have pathetically low stamina, like the walk to my mail box wears me out. yet the judge thinks i can fucking work. ...who knows, maybe i just have a victi am complex. i know i have tried, but it sti will feels like i did not try hard enough, that i am a failure, useless. this is with me on two different anti depressants that for the most part work, i am sure without them... well... idk. it wouldn t be good. i am sorry mom, i am a fucking failure. your support was for nothing....	severe

anti depressants have ruined so many good things for me m i do not rant very often, but i would like to share my personal experience regarding what anti depressants have done to me as an individual. i began taking lexapro in because i had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. it took a long ti ame for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. my anxiety has been terrible since i was a kid. i needed to figure it out. so late last november i switched to prozac. worst idea of my life. i started dating this wonderful girl who was independent and sweet and empathetic with me, which helped me someti ames feel like i could fight my mental health problems, but when the medication started ramping up in december, i started throwing and breaking things, and eventually we got into physical altercations. i have never in my life been in a fight with another human being. i am a small guy, i do not like confrontation, and i do not appreciate when people are irrationally violent. well, prozac made me absolutely violent. it is sti will coming out of my system and i can feel it lessening everyday, but i sti will can not seem to hold down the rage. i can not stop myself from having knee jerk reactions to even little things like what i hear or what people say to me. i am in so much pain because this medication is not helping me control anything like my doctor promised. i am going to start therapy in hopes to curb this, but i have not had these issues since i was ten or eleven years old. back in september i was happy, but anxious, and someti ames fell into depression, but i got out of it. i do not want to try anymore medication. i was perfectly fine just taking the hits and dealing with it on my own, but prozac made me feel like i had no control. i sti will someti ames feel like i do not. props to my girlfriend f , for she has not left me while i struggle with this, but i am feeling like an outcast too. i have slept on the couch for two weeks as punishment from her. i tell her how i feel and she says i wonder why and then tells me to prove i can be different. i just want this bullshit to stop! i am so done feeling like this. i want the pain to stop and i just want to be me again.	severe

prozac and my new life i have never posted anything on here before, but i stumbled on this subreddit and wow what a relief. to see the out pouring of people sharing their stories is amazing. i have recently started on medication prozac mg and let me tell you what a game changer. my thoughts are far more clear and the so much negativity is gone. my ability to think rationally now is so unreal it is almost euphoric. it is been about a month now and i have gone through so many changes with my mental health it is truly exciting and such a relief. however, as the days go by and the euphoria of this clarity dwindles i find myself becoming stressed over the flood of thoughts and positivity. i was wondering if there was anyone else out there that can offer some of their experiences or advice to keep powering forward and conquering this what i see as a second chance with mental health. to give you some background on myself i am know and was diagnosed with depression at a very young age . until recently i was not aware of that fact which was honestly a bit thisturbing to hear. also, on top of that, as it turns out, i was medicated shortly after being diagnosed and for some reason given the choice a few months later to stop the medication idk what med . naturally as a or y.o i chose not to take it anymore. for as long as i can remember i was always that kid that had some sort of erratic behavior. anything i did it was to the max. every feeling and emotion was amplified and caused me to act out in a less than constructive manner. i had and lost countless friends because of my behavior and never really knew why. as i got older the confusion and heart ache of not understanding why i was the way i was turned a lot of the embarrassment into fear and anger. once middle school came around i started to act out and get in a lot of trouble. by th grade i had been arrested for the first ti ame and severed every friendship i had but one. i then went to a private school for hs where things started to get better and i was able to reinvent myself. i was in a tougher area with tougher people who could handle me and put me in my place when things got bad. the trouble continued. i was arrested again sophomore year and the outbursts only got worse from there. i now realize that i was a person who self harmed. i tried on several occasions to hang myself in elementary school, i would make dangerous and i ampossible jumps to send me and my bike off knowing i wouldn t lad safely in middle school, i ran skated head first as hard as i could into people on the ice and on the football field someti ames knocking myself out because i like the way i punished myself, i enlisted as a grunt in the marines to go to combat and hopefully be ki willed so i did not have to do it myself, i failed in college, i failed in a construction setting, i became a firefighter for many of the same reasons as the marines, i torture myself with horrific online videos, and worst of all i was self depricating to the point of i ammobility and almost suicide several ti ames. last year i decided to seek help because i was in a relationship with a person i thought was the one. best decision i ever made. after refusing so many ti ames out of skepticism i finally decided to take medication. it took two different meds to find the right one but wow what a change. i can happily say i have made significan not i amprovement in my mental health and finally feel i can be happy. i am out of a toxic relationship and into a brand new world. does anyone share si amilar stories or want to hear more about mine to see if you relate? open to any and all questions.	severe

never been suicidal until now i am a year old kid trying to finish up my second semester in college. up until i was about i would say i had a pretty normal life. however, in january my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. he had a long fought battle but the thisease eventually took his life in january . in the months leading up to jan. , i missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse hi am on a day to day basis. it was during this ti ame when i believe my depression first was onset. i was getting hours of sleep at most everyday while i had to watch my father wither away. consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my gpa dropped significan notly and i was in a dual credit course at the ti ame with the college i planned to attend which lowered my college gpa before i was even in it. after my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof. this left a rift in my family and i hardly hear from that entire side at all now. fast forward to graduation and summer of , i started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things. this became an extremely toxic habit and i spent most of the money i had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia. finally, august rolls around and i begin my first semester at college. for a brief period, things seemingly got better and i did not feel as empty as before. however, about a month in i got a sinus infection and this persisted until february until i ulti amately had to have surgery. around early december, i began talking to a beautiful girl who i really liked and once again i had hope that maybe things would get better. it was at this ti ame though i started abusing drugs and i would take molly, xanax, coke, percs, etc. to dull the pain i felt. fast forward again to january and rush for fraternities is starting to happen. at my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being greek so it is almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends. however, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections. the house that i am well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class. inevitably, i had to go to houses where i had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely. i put a great deal of value into getting into a house because i had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things did not work out and i was left empty handed. additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then i have had very little contact with them. on top of that the girl i was talking to got into an amazing house which i am happy of her for, but this meant that i could only see her a couple days a week at most. the week after rush i got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever. my mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital. the doctor told me i needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that i also had active mononucleosis. as a result, i missed about weeks of school in february and fell behind in almost all of my classes. when i finally got back, i had to drop of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i am in at risk. at this ti ame, the girl i was talking to began thistancing herself from me even more. fast forward to today, and i slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there is good chance i need to unenroll this semester now and the girl i was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media. i am sorry if this is trivial, but i feel like no matter how hard i try life is just repeatedly beating me down. so here i am today. a broke kid who got a on his sat but could only manage to get a . in college and on the verge of losing everything i have worked towards my entire life, lonely and losing the one thing that made me happy. i do not really care if anyone reads this or not but i had to get all my feelings out because everyday i wake up and just cry. physically i feel awful, i am lonely, i feel like a failure, and nobody is here for me to even talk to.	severe
i feel like i was fired because of my mental i willness i got fired from my job yesterday because i missed days of work from being sick, i even had a dr is note for every day. i feel like my boss used my mental i willness against me too. about a month and a half ago i had a panic attack in front of my bosses and told them i was having a hard ti ame adjusting to the job and told her that i was depressed and trying to cope. today the hr person and my boss pulled me into their office and the hr lady said so, you missed four days of work and you have shared with us that you do not like working here, so we re letting you go. i was too stunned to say anything so i just sat quietly while they brought me the things from my desk in a box and walked me out. i am incredibly angry, but relieved at the same ti ame. i am also scared and anxious because i have never had no income before and i have never been fired. i really felt like what they did was so cruel. i am trying to think positive and push forward.	severe
hi everyone i am sitting on my bathroom floor with a small green knife next to me. i have contemplated committing suicide and i really want to do it, i dont have the guts suddenly. i wanted to die using helium, because its painless but i can not wait to get some helium, i want to do it now before having to live through another agonizing day. i tried go cut my wrist but i couldnt. and i tried to call suicide prevention but the waiting for them to pick up agitates me, so i drop it i dont know what to do. i can not do anything but sit and cry and hope my life wi will finally end.	severe
social anxiety makes me want to die someti ames my social phobia started years ago. my worst episode was when i barely left the house for half a year. i was rarely going out and if i was going out when i really had to go to the pharmacy or hospital it was dark sti will early in the morning or late in the evening . i went to two groups for people with social phobia and individual therapy sessions with my therapist. it got better. it was so hard with the first group. i was getting strongest headaches because of extreme anxiety i sti will get those and had to take tranqui willisers each ti ame. i started to talk to people but just the ones who attended the groups. my social anxiety is sti will bad. someti ames i am better. someti ames it gets so bad that i want to die cause it is so painful to live like this. i felt it yesterday. i really had to go to the mall to buy my partner a gift. it was a painful experience i was constantly analysing my words and behaviour, my heart was pounding, stuttering . then i went alone to the movies i like horrors and for , hours i was constantly analysing my behaviour and my words to the ladies who work in the store i also have ocd . i am anxious in public and someti ames i even have to take tranqui willisers just to leave the house. i am waisting my youth because of depression and social phobia. i wasted years of my life. i know some people have it worse. but this is my experience. i just hope i wi will get better and start living.	severe
maybe some people are meant to be sad after trying many different medications i am starting to think that maybe its not that i am depressed, maybe i just have a shitty life and should be sad about it and theres nothing to be done. maybe i was made to suffer and nothing wi will ever stop this feeling. maybe its just the way things are.	severe
do you ever get so deeply depressed that it actually scares the living s t out of you? i do not even know how to put this into words, but someti ames when i get deeply depressed, i have this feeling that everything is so god d n bleak and hopeless that nothing is ever going to fix that and i am doomed and everything is going to hell, i wi will never experience happiness again and maybe i am going to get hospitalized because i wi will be too depressed and unable to do s t and my parents are going to sit next to my bed and cry thinking what have we done wrong?? etc etc... and that scares the living s t out of me! so then it is not just depression but also terrible fear, that is, two huge problems at the same ti ame and i feel paralyzed about it and whatever i try to do about it, like thinking more rationally about the situation, it just does not work as the feeling is too strong and i get even more scared because it does not work which makes hospitalization etc even more likely, and the loop continues. the only thing that works it literally doing nothing about it, just waiting for it to end by itself, and just trying to occupy myself with whatever i need to be doing at the ti ame. that way i endure the least possible amount of misery. the strangest thing is, this kind of deep fearful depression often happens for no real reason, like if i already woke up depressed and the day is bad to start with. usually as the day goes on, the feeling thissipates and by the evening, i feel much better and often totally forget about the episode. i almost asked if this was normal... d note this is my nd attempt at posting this. first ti ame i used some common but offensive words like s t without censoring it and that did not go well, the post was deleted. it did not do it to be purposefully rude and offensive but more as a freedom taken to i willustrate the seriousness of the issue. am i allowed to say god d n or is that offensive too? never matter, i wi will censor that too. 	severe
after struggling with depression for the last years i feel like i have come out on top this is the only place where i feel like people could possibly understand what i went through and i want to both vent and celebrate a bit. i first started therapy for depression in when i was in th grade. what followed were years of therapy , in fact , multiple month long stays in mental hospitals, a suicide attempt, tons of different meds anti depressants and anti psychotics because i suffered from depression induced psychosis at one point , an eating thisorder ednos , got diagnosed with social anxiety, i self harmed for years upon years and have gotten hundreds of stitches and staples throughout that ti ame. i have written suicide notes over and over again, set myself end dates, contemplated my death thousands of ti ames. i have a difficult family situation and have endured bullying in school for many years. i dropped out of university because of my depression. i truly thought that i would never, ever overcome my mental i willness even a bit. now it is . i recently saw my therapist for the last ti ame, though i have only met up with hi am about ti ames in the last years anyway. i have not self harmed in about . years. last ti ame i took meds was about years ago. do i sti will feel down someti ames? fuck yes. i thislike my job and sti will struggle with self hatred someti ames. i sti will do not have friends. but on average, i feel happy. i go to the gym ti ames a week, i have hobbies, i can laugh and i can cry used to be too numb for that , i read a lot and work on i amproving myself, and most of all i genuinely want to live. i want to know what else life has in store for me. i enjoy being alive. if you have read this then i just want to thank you for your ti ame and want you to know that there is hope for you even if you are just like i was absolutely hopeless and thinking that there is no way to ever be cured from this.	severe
i feel like all my energy is gone hello, recently things got worse and worse, i lost all my friends, i got fired from my favourite job and my heart got broken. people start to avoid me or act weird around me. i feel like i can not talk to anyone anymore, i just feel like nobody likes me anymore and people start ignoring me. my heart literally hurts and i dont know how to handle this anymore. i do have clinical depression, and i have been going to therapy but it doesnt help me anymore so i left. can i change myself so people start liking me? if yes, does anyone have tips?	severe
feeling suicidal how do you keep pushing forward? just to note i am on medication, i have changed my medication, it helps with the anxiety. i am also in therapy and i have a great therapist. i know i am very lucky. it is been about a year and a half since this particular episode and now i am back were i started...making plans again. i feel incredibly frustrated and an absolute burden. i guess i want to vent and a little support. what do you do when your feeling this low?	severe

wellbutrin and paroxetine severely depressed and exhausted hey everyone, i would really love to hear some first hand experiences, because i am in a terrible place right now. i have suffered from depression for decades. i am currently taking mg paroxetine for depression about years and mg x of dextroamphetamine about years, not everyday . if i do not take the dextroamphetamine i suffer from severe lethargy, hollowness, lack of interest in almost all of the activities i am passionate about, horrible absence of sex drive and just a general ambivalent thisposition about everything. the paroxetine has helped tremendously with my obsessive thoughts, my insomnia and some aspects of my general anxiety however, i can not continue living life with this feeling of complete lack of passion and drive. i do not want to be on dexedrine any longer as it is effects are dwindling and so i am thinking about trying wellbutrin. i am hoping that it wi will, to some extent, help with the lethargy and help negate some of the numbed feelings of paroxetine. i understand that it is a dnri, and i believe i understand it is pharmacological action. i know it would not give me the alertness that dextroamphetamine does, and that is fine. i just want to have my feelings of excitement, sexual intrigue, and interest in more than sleeping and staying inside the house. i know everyone is different, but please, has anyone went from amphetamines to wellbutrin and how was your experience? any help would be greatly appreciated, i feel like i am completely stuck. thanks!	severe
i do not understand i want to ki will myself but i would not because i should not do it. but i do not want to live and i have no energy to live so how the hell am i going to get better if i do not have the motivation to get better? i am on antidepressants and i am supposed to go to therapy but i am not going because i do not have the energy to do so. how can someone like me who is so depressed that they have no hope of becoming better and have no motivation to get better actually get better. or how can people expect them not to ki will themselves when there is no fucking chance of getting a better life. i am actually really mad it is not accepted to ki will yourself. if in that way i am going to be happy then let me be. people who want me to stay alive do not realise how much i hate myself and always wi will. i do not remember a moment i did not hate myself. just let me and the people who do not want the gift of life die and try to see it as their sweet release.	severe
breakups and recurrent depression i broke up with my girlfriend of years about weeks ago, and i handled things pretty well for the first couple of weeks but now i feel like i have slid downhi will. i was diagnosed with recurrent major depression, and have been medicated for it, about two years ago. i am starting to notice some of my signs of depression, including complete lack of motivation, minor things being overwhelming hello laundry! , etc. at what point is it reasonable to say that maybe my medication is not working as well as it should be vs these are normal things after a break up? i currently just see my pri amary care doctor for prescribing, is it ti ame to move to a psychiatrist? i am already seeing a regular therapist.	severe
i want help but all the help i have gotten does not really help i have been depressed for years and i do not want to feel this way anymore, but every ti ame i get help or try to talk to someone about it they do not understand. the last therapist i went to helped but also did not, she pretty much said i did not need to see her anymore. i know i have no reason really to feel the way i do but i can not change the way i feel. my mom does not take it serious because of issues with my older sister. all the solutions i have tried just seem like quick temporary fixes. i do not really know what to do anymore.	severe
i called three different helplines tonight i wanted to end things tonight. i came incredibly close to doing it but chickened out. i knew it would fail and i would have to deal with the consequences. i sti will feel so rough i called the helpline given to me by the adult mental health team for their patients. i spoke to a mental health nurse. she told me this is expected because of my change in medication. she did not tell me how to deal with it. she said it is my brain missing the serotonin and it wi will be ok soon. i called nhs . they deemed it not an emergency since i did not go through with it. i am ok with that since i really do not want to spend a night in the hospital waiting room so i can chat to a psychiatrist for minutes. the call taker was very mechanical about things. she told me to speak to a crisis team. i called my local mental health crisis team. they said i should speak to the adult mental health team helpline the one i called first . they said i should take my meds for the night and then listen to some music. just mindfully listen and clear my head. it was weird. they all just decided the call was over. they never asked if i had anything i wanted to say. maybe that is unreasonable for me to expect. if i called three helplines and none worked, maybe i am the problem. they were all trained healthcare professionals, not volunteers. it should have worked. i feel like a lost cause.	severe
i hate everything about myself i can not stand who i am. i have nothing going for me. i am not depressed, i do not want to die, but i absolutely hate the person i am. i am incredibly ugly, stupid, and a horrible person. no matter what i do to try to i amprove myself i set myself back further. last year i tried to off myself and i took , mg of aspirin and instead of dying i destroyed my kidneys. i have type diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, ptsd, adhd, and terrible anxiety. everything in my life brings me pain and i can never have a moment of happiness. i know i do not want to die, i want to live, but i do not want to live being the person i am. i want to i amprove myself but all my negative qualities sti will stand true. my entire life i have always felt this way about myself. i just want happiness, that is everything to me. i do not even know what to do anymore. i am so bored of life and tired of who i am. i am a senior in high school and i have skipped every school dance because i can never find a date or anyone who is remotely interested in me. i literally have no positive qualities about myself. even if i am not in pain mentally, i wi will sti will always be hurting physically. i have good grades in school, accepted into a good college, and am going to be a registered nurse. but what is the point of the future if my entire life is pain? it is all i know.	severe
paralyzed from emotions its saturday. its a beautiful day out. there are things that i can think of to do and go. i feel completely overwhelmed and paralyzed from my emotions. the past hours i was laying in bed with my eyes closed trying to pass out or to stop thinking. i am constantly thinking of ki willing myself. i am constantly thinking of what validates me to be alive. i think purpose is self prescribed but every day since i was young i keep hold on this existential shame and want to ki will myself. i stop explainging that i am upset to people other than just saying that i am depressed. i wish that i didnt exist. i have been having thisassociative feelings where i am outside of my physical body watching a movie play in from my experiences for the past couple years. things always feel like they get worse and more hopeless. i started doing things that i feel like are somewhat close to self mutilation but i feel too ashamed to describe to anyone. i started therapy a year ago because i keep thinking of ki willing myself and i begin to plan out how i need to do it to make sure it gets done instead of trying to find what good there may be in life. i am years old. i see younger teens on here and some other ages too. i have a lot of good things in life but they do not really mean anything to me. i have a job and enough money to live in a small apartment. i do not feel like i have friends that i can really talk to and i get further from my family all of the ti ame. i am just waiting to die everyday. i wake up and fall asleep thinking that i should not be alive. when people describe to me what makes life worthwhile to them it does not make sense to me. i just want everything to fade to black. no more experiences. i want to return to nothing that is where i belong. i feel like i am crying but no tears come out. just this sinking inside of me and a soft shudder within my chest like quiet sobbing. i am also bummed because my therapist an intern who has been pretty good at describing emotional intelligence and helping me understand how to describe some things better is going to possibly stop meeting me and she said she might refer me to a different therapist. not the end of the world, but sti will sad to think of this person that i have been explaining my sadness to. that is pretty much it. i think i just needed to write something instead of balling up and pretending not to exist in bed mid afternoon.	severe
had a nightmare about suicide i have not had a major depressive episode in three years. when i was depressed, i had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and i wi will never forget them. lately, i have been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday i had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up. in the dream, it was a sunny day and i was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great ti ame. there was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and i went to go hang out with them but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious in real life she is not depressed or remotely mentally i will at all so i do not know why i conjured this up . she was saying stuff like well when i jump off a bridge this would not matter and everyone was laughing, but i burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and i could not stand the thought of her suffering. to make matters worse, i was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. one of the other people in the group looked at me while i was crying and asked, what is wrong? and i said because none of these people around me wi will be here after i end my life. then i started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people is parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could have done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. i said to myself i hate thinking about suicide and cried even harder, and then i woke up in the dream but not actually in real life . then after i woke up from that dream into another dream, i was suddenly in my best friend is house traumatized from that dream i had. i was going to see my girlfriend soon, but i was sti will depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though i have her. then i actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated. i wanted to tell my friends about the dream i had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so i thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it.	severe
desperately need help but can never seem to get results i am at a complete loss and have no idea where to look. my whole life people have perceived me as the funny, goofy extrovert. to be fair it is a role i have given to myself, growing up i would always try to thismiss anything i found negative with a joke. being the funny one allowed me to hide from reality and kept me happy. this worked fine throughout elementary school and made me a pretty happy kid, yet in middle school things started taking a turn for the worse. for as i can remember i have struggled with adhd and anger issues. after middle school and throughout high school i started developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and borderline bipolarism. i am not sure if i can say i was bullied, but i have definitely been traumatized by certain friend groups and people. for example, in grades and i was in a toxic friend group with the older cool kids . because i was the young one i was always seen as lesser and treated like i was everyone is verbal punching bag. i would often be excluded from events or embarrassed in class because of the teasing. in grade i once got confronted by an angry mob of big dudes because some guy that i beat up in complete self defence told someone that i was making fun of his autistic friend. this resulted in me getting circled and nearly lynched not literally, at least i hope for something i did not do. i sti will struggle with severe ptsd from that day. i am not fucked up all of the ti ame, someti ames i wi will go weeks feeling like i am on cloud . but no matter what it all comes back eventually. the only thing i have actually had diagnosed is adhd, si amply because i have no idea how to explain my other internal struggles nor do i want to. very rarely wi will i tell someone that i need help. anyti ame i have ever tried to bring them up friends or family my problems were trivialized and met with responses like oh things wi will get better with ti ame or just wait ti will you re an adult, you ll figure it out . well i am an adult now, and i sure as fuck have not figured it out. i struggle with the same issues i have had since i was a kid, and it is made me feel so terribly isolated no matter how many friends family i am surrounded by. i have resorted to smoking weed every single day until i pass out to try and keep my problems at bay while i try to finish university. this has made me a lazy cunt that struggles to maintain what used to be my favourite hobby, bodybuilding. i have tried quitting a few ti ames, however whenever i stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that is haunted me my entire life just comes back. i have had to quit drinking, i can not party with my friends anymore because every ti ame i get drunk i let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. i have gotten into many drunk fights, and it is gotten to the point where i wi will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. while drunk, it is either the version of me that loves everyone and wi will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it is the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. this is why i ended up loving weed so much, when i am backed i am the nice version of myself that i recognize from when i was kid. fuck i wish i could go back to my childhood. i do not blame people for not understanding, i can never communicate it properly. every ti ame i have met with my psychiatrist it is like i am describing a completely different issue, i often ti ames over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it is like i just panic and lie whenever someone try is to get me to open up. because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume i am full of shit all the ti ame and i have definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. i am only years old, and i am starting to reach my breaking point. i do not know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing i want more than to feel consistently normal. if you were to see me in public, you wouldn t guess any of this. you would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. behind that mask is a lonely cunt that does not fully understand other people and sure as fuck does not understand hi amself. i do have lots of great friends and i could not have asked for a better family, however despite my blessings i feel terribly cursed. please, does anybody have some advice???	severe
why do i even bother to get help when no one listens? my sui thoughts are getting worse so what to they do? tell me to take a medication that i dont want to take and wi will probably just make everything worse. i am in a crisis so i call a crisis line and what do they do? tell me to text an extremely unreliable person who ll probably text back like days later and tell me everything is fine as of days ago, like what a relief! that would not make me panic more! it is like i ask for help and they ask themselves hmm, how can we push you even further towards the edge? mental health care is such a fucking joke.	severe
why do you choose to live? i am super done with life. i hate living. i hate looking in front of the mirror everyday and looking at my reflection. i delusionally quit computer science when i realized even if i make k a year it wouldn t be enough to support my family let alone the people in my neighborhood. i do not know, i guess over ti ame you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. just by observing those people with same scenario my age. i look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. they are put on pi wills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. in my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. the thing i hate most about myself too is the fact i feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle east who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. there is the camps in china where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. people say the world is getting better but it feels blind. i know people in canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. the truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country. there is also so many other issues. like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercri aminalty aspect of it, but there is so many more layers to that. these artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. they get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. if middle class kids liked bubbly music i am a certain these poor artist would start making music like that. the truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you would not be able to support your fami willy so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. the other sad truth is in some big number artist make it. look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were cri aminals or lived a gangster lifestyle in this generation . a lot of these artist do not want to do that. nba youngboy jail, drugs, etc , the kelly ki willed best friend , kodak black drugs, jail, etc . why do not they just do pop? no resources, not enough ti ame to work a hour job, sing, create, etc. a lot of pop artist have big teams. if your a female in a poor area you re even more screwed. most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. their is not much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. we see those who succeeded but not many of those who did not. a lot of them did put work in too. my whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. the pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. anyways i ask myself, why should you live if you re just at the bottom? hope? we see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people do not end up like that. you have to pick a poison. in the world we live in it is getting harder and harder for people to make it out. kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one wi willing to hand that out. homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what i have seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. why should i live, work ti ames harder, sacrifice all of my free ti ame, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? also, i mentioned i hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? why should that be okay? why is that something you can tell someone. be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. i thisagree with telling someone that. there should be a fine line. i think kids should not get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. why is suicide looked down upon is what i am asking. hell, should i tell that homeless person to have hope? statistically speaking, things are not getting better for hi am. enjoy the little things. this is where i am just being a brat, but it is hard to enjoy those things when i do not know if i am getting food tommorow, and then i see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you do not have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. it kinda gets to you. what is the point of living? friends and family i never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? also people do care they just to social media to help. reality is that does not help. we had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. you can not get violent or cause thisruption or else you get arrested. therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you do not want. it seems like half the ti ame people bring awareness to stuff it is cause it is trendy too. i saw so many post on the australian fires, but a few on the uighur camps in china. i saw mi willions mourn the death of a rapper, but mini amal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it is not trendy. respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? it does not work. some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. no one puts their hand up cause it is not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support are not i amportant. . mi will on black lives and less than combined on mexican and brown. sorry random rants in random order. lots to get off my chest. what is the point of living. i am a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. i looked it up, and found only brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. the rest were predominantly white or black. statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. even brown chicks guys from other races. i would say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. the other options are not so friendly either. go to school and not support my family. bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music. what is the point in living? hell i make it seem like i am just saying for people at the bottom, but even other people too.	severe
depressed me ruined my life recently stopped a depression med with my psychiatrist is permission. my symptoms i ammediately i amproved. had been on antidepressants since i am now. i initially did great after quitting the med, but taking stock of life has been a bummer. i hate the admittedly lucrative field i wi will be working in, but that does not bother me so much. i hate being an adult and not having the social ski wills to make new friends or have romantic relationships. i hate the vicious cycle of social isolation and social anxiety. i hate knowing that i missed out on years of essential social development. there are two things that really bother me about this. first, it is my fault. men have tried to be friends with me even recently , women have shown interest in me not so much anymore lmao , but i just ignored them and wasted my life reading nonfiction books that serve no use beyond bringing a conversation to a halt as fast as possible. why? first because of depression. then because i had isolated myself enough to have social anxiety. now because i never learned how to have healthy friendships, much less flirt with women. all avoidable. second, it feels like it is over. i did not have experiences that can only happen at certain ti ames in your life. i have passed the point where being socially incompetent is acceptable. it is fucked and i can not unfuck it. my future coworkers are largely in serious relationships or married. i feel like a child talking to them. they have preexisting friend groups, often near work. i have neither, and i already have a reputation for being weird and antisocial. of course my life is not over for certain, but there is probably a substantial chance i end up isolated and depressed again, and the fix would not be as easy as dropping a medication. then it wouldn t be a cognitive thistortion that my life is miserable, and the only way to escape my depression is to escape my life, it would be true. not expecting any advice. just needed to vent, since there is no one i can say this to irl.	severe
i need advice... so i am just going to tell you my story. i have felt extremely depressed for the past year and a half or so, ever since my dad died to a heart condition in october of . flash forward to now, and i am sti will like i am, but i feel it is worse. for one, my family is in very bad shape in terms of finances, especially due to the fact that my mother and father had a baby before he died. so it is becoming difficult to pay for anything we need, like food, clothes, etc.. on the family side of things, most of us are just divided. fights have broken out, causing some of us to just not show up to family gatherings anymore. it does not really help that i was not exactly close to any of them in the first place. i just feel like i am caught in the middle of it all. and i feel hopeless because i have absolutely no clue how to help, nor do i think i can. on the personal side, i just have this deep, severe hatred for myself now. not only does feeling like this leave me tired and i just have no drive to do anything anymore, even the things i normally enjoy, but it gets really bad someti ames because i someti ames think that i want to ki will myself, and that the world would be better off without me. that the pain would finally end. on top of all that, i am constantly bullied, online and in real life, for enjoying the things that i do, or i just get bullied in general. i also struggle to make friends, because i feel extremely insecure. most of the kids at my school are super popular, and i am just this socially anxious, insecure kid in the corner. people tell me to have confidence and people wi will like me, but it does not work. when i try to be confident and tell jokes and stuff, it leads to people calling me weird, laughing insultingly, or just being silent. even the friends i do have do this someti ames. my best friend in the whole world he has always had my back and never once insults me or anything, he just constantly tries to help me out moved away and i never get to see hi am anymore. i am super sorry for the long explanation, i just really want to feel better, but i keep losing hope by the minute. i feel like there is zero chance for me to get better. the only chance i have, in my eyes, is for this to all get progressively worse. thank you for reading if you did.	severe
so i realized today that i am so broken i can not be fixed so i have been in therapy since i was years old and sti will i am haunted by my past. i do not know how to let go of the terrible things that people have done to me. like was i a terrible person for sure. i told horrible lies but i lived with the consequences and now i am left with nothing but torment for the things that have been done to be by others. i do not know how to forgive others. it is not in my nature it is not in my heart. i am a bitter woman. my husband always tells me that i talk down to people. i do not talk down to people i speak in facts and truths, no one wants to hear it, and i am always the bitch. so fine no one likes me not even my family i am the black sheep. i have been trying for years and years to fit in but now i am asking myself why? i do not believe what they believe i have lived a different life from them so i do not need to be like them. i have been struggling with a severe mental i willness for over half my life and things went downhi will fast when i got pregnant with my son and i have never recovered. i am a lost cause and there is no hope for me. i am here for my kids but i just do not know that it is enough anymore. no one really cares at the end of the day. i am just some stuck up bitch who thinks i am better than everyone else. and yes that is a direct quote from my husband! he sounds so nice right?!	severe

i am so tired part ti ame job iv been scraping at for years and the whole ti ame trying for a full ti ame position at the company. even getting my cdl license to get a step up but showing hard work and loyalty means nothing in this world. living with mother in law who has ever self inflicted ailment known in the book, also a hoarder who we had to clean her room multiple ti ames , fianc s annoying, over bearing, can not be left alone without her bestie , bitch of a best friend, and two dogs that just can not fucking lay down and relax. i want to move me and my future wife out but i can not get the job to do it. they say money is not everything but i bet if i had a shit fucking ton of it i would be happier. this paycheck to paycheck bullshit is ki willing me mentally. i pinch every penny i get but it eventually slips from my grasp. i drink on the weekends. just to bring a lil light into my life. thought of ki willing myself but my wife is what i hold on to. she is my life. my whole world. i just hate that i have to share her and that it is not just me and her yet. she understands my pain and my problems. she tells me to hold on and that we wi will be free of all this some day. i use to believe her completely but as of late iv been growing further and further from the idea. i am just so tired.	severe
the world is cruel, unfair, and unforgiving i have fought this fucking thisease since i was a child, apparently born with it, as m symptoms started cropping up during elementary school. i also was diagnosed ptsd, autism, adhd, anxiety, and paranoia thisorders. i have just reached twenty and yet feel like my life is over. i have no parents, no family, no one. one of them died when i was in elementary school. my parent tried to shoot themselves in the face in front of me, neglected me, and threw fits of rage early in my childhood. the other abandoned me at birth but i was never put into the system and tossed from place to place, grew up in a rural hellhole that is rife with cri ame and poverty, no home. all i have left is one of my grandparents, as i watched the other one die, and i weep constantly at the thought of my grandmother dying too. because i know it is inevitable. life is cruel. nature is not fair. humans as a species have overcame so many barriers as a species to evolve, yet we create these meaningless societal institutions constructs that create even more unnecessary struggle. all my life i was told my goal was to be good in school, to be smart, to land a good job, and i would make it. i had no idea that i would be raped as a teenager. i had no idea that i would be molested by doctors and that would create a lifeti ame of ptsd. i had no idea my first two partners would abuse me. i have tried my damndest to stay in school whilst these terrible things happen, but there is no forgiveness for weakness in this world. i remember not finishing some student council powerpoint in my last month of high school. i did not go to school my last month, as i was borderline suicidal. i remember a teacher getting up in my face and telling me how i did not deserve to be a leader, how thisappointed people should be in me. she had marked me down for months despite me scoring a perfect on the ap exam, because she preferred my sister in a foster home above me, and knew i was terrified of her. another teacher was great friends with the guy who molested me and gave me straight s for missing school because my ptsd had become unbearable. the principal told me i should give up my dream universities and settle for a local tech school that didnt have my program. it was not fair. they did not realize what i went through at home, or my lack of one. it is been years, and the people i graduated with are in junior year of university, i am so behind. i managed to go to a somewhat good private school later on with scholarship, but i hate it here. i was borderline molested by another doctor who pushed me around and touched me innapropriately, my ptsd is so bad to the point where i can not breathe if i hear anything medical related. my school is organization is a mess and many people fail. i keep having to withdraw from classes cause my thisability accomodations were denied. people are rude and catty. i sit in my room and have severe paranoia and panic attacks ti will i sob and shake with pure agony. my psychiatrist does not believe how bad i am. it is unfair. after being in abusive relationships i met a guy online and things were going fine for a bit. we visited each other in different countries. then when my ptsd got bad he started calling me a special snowflake, saying i was horrible, a drama queen, mentally unwell and i will, must have been exaggerating my abuse, etc. ruined my self esteem. i am visiting and in bed with hi am right now and he is so sweet and kind, yet i remember his cruel words. i truly do not feel loved by anyone in this world. i wanted to be a scientist to research cures for depression, but my school could care less for me. no one cares about me. i have no friends, no support, and my physical and mental health is shit. if there is one thing i have learned in doing scientific research, it is how cruel and vile nature is. i can not handle all the pain in this world.	severe
there is nothing good about my life i am and i have been stuck in my room for months. i do not go off with friends near as much as i used to, mainly because i can not about a year and a half ago i started selling drugs. i was really good at it, and i had a constant party life style. i had money to blow, drugs to run through, and there was always something to do. i got up to about k at once point we would rail coke, get drunk, smoke weed and all kinds of shit the party would never stop even when going to sell the drugs. i would have cars lined up outside of my house, really fucking stupidly, coming one after another. i got so used to this standard of living. everyone wanted to be around me, i had people i did not even remember meeting saying what is up like they knew me. i was not famous or anything, but it was like i was around town. during this ti ame i managed to get kicked out of high school my senior year all of my friends , i started to almost never hear from. it is like i became a loser in a matter of weeks i do not even know how i managed this, but i quit selling and blew through all of my money in months with not a damn thing to show for it. almost all of my friends , i started doing kratom when i was near brome, a legal opiate basically. it made me okay with laying in bed doing nothing all day, and i felt way less bad about my life i realized i was just another guy, i am not special at all. my goal with selling was to get enough money to start up something legit like a business, i refused to work a and slave away all day. well long story short now i am broke. i stay in my room most of the ti ame. i ended up getting my ged, but i have not done anything with it. no one really wants to hang around me anymore and i am not invited to anything. i feel more alone than ever before i want to actually become something, i have plans. plans that i have not acted on, everyti ame i bring myself to do something i just end up falling out on it. i have almost no motivation, but i am also scared of being a failure. i do not want to be another guy working paycheck to paycheck struggling to get by. i know i can not succeed if i do not try, but it is just scary having no idea what the future holds. these negative thoughts have kept me from even trying, like i am useless and would not be able to do anything if i tried. i have thought about ki willing myself a few ti ames, but i do not think i wi will ever act on it, i am too afraid to die. there is a lot more that goes into my depression, but that is the gist of it i guess. i thought about deleting this just now, but whatever i think i sort of explained my situation	severe
can i just get a little feedback i used to be suicidal, actually it was all i ever thought about at one point in my life, but that was years ago and i thought things had gotten better truly and actually in early january i was feeling the best i have ever felt it was like my life was finally moving on the up and out i had my own car i had a job i loved and i had passed all my classes with another semester on the horizon and now after a string of bad luck, my car that broke down and now a job that only seems to get more and more stressful by the day i feel like i am sinking back into that pit i was in almost four years ago now. i am so angry and bitter and i can do nothing but cry most days i just do not know what to do. i mean therapy is the best option but i do not have money and i am pretty sure my insurance can not cover it or at least enough of it to help me out. i just wish i just was not so upset all the ti ame i just wish i did not lash out at every minor inconvenience it feels like the person i was just two months ago was just so far to who i am now and i am slowly but surely bringing myself right back to square one. i dunno maybe some tips to help myself out i mean i am not at a point of suicide do not worry it has not gotten back to that point it is just beginning to mess with the relationships in life and just seems to suck the soul out of everything i do	severe
i manipulate everyone naturally. i have had quite a few revelations to myself lately of how i am constantly manipulating almost everyone i know and i can not stop. i always thought i just had adhd and could not pay attention but i have noticed that the things i remember are only things i am interested in. i can not remember birthdays, promises, or even conversations from the day before clearly, but i can remember a digit random key passcode with relative ease. i have told myself countless ti ames i wi will try to always acknowledge my partner is feelings and to think clearly about what i am doing means for them, but every day it seems i convince myself again that only trying to do what i think they want is not emotional manipulation. the reason this is in r depression is that i am seeing this happen over and over and i am watching myself destroy my partner and somehow i sti will find myself to be the victi am of my own abuse instead of them. i want to stop but i do not know if can i escape my own manipulation.. i can not stop thinking want to just die to save them from myself because i do not believe i can change.	severe

have not felt anything other than depression since end of toxic relationship about a year ago i got out of a ish month relationship with a girl who i fell in love with. i thought everything i went through was just normal relationship shit, turns out she has bpd which is actually insanely hard to deal with. the best part of my life became the worst part of my life with the worst depression i have ever had when she just stopped talking to me all together out of the blue, and at the ti ame we were in the same class every morning, so needless to say it was annihilating me from the inside out for about a month, until she all the sudden wanted me back. this happened ti ames until i just said fuck it the last ti ame and blocked her on everything, graduated high school and havent talked to her since. shortly after the last ti ame she did it i learned about bpd and all the tells were there and it made so much sense. the entire thing was just emotional abuse and manipulation from the start that caused me to begin self harm. i have noticed that since then i have some big fucking committment issues and i just push people away without trying, which just makes the depression and loneliness worse and i do not know what to do anymore...	severe
not sad or happy about my life but just nothing i am , bilingual, gay not ugly and above average looking and fit , asian, nerdy lived through most of my life being making fun or hated for my eccentricity i have no friends, but many acquaintances. maybe i am putting friends to a very high standard i never had any relationship even though i came out years ago to my parents, and being very open about my sexuality. i do not want to share my body to strangers, so i reject all hook up attempts, and i feel that most gay people i met are just insecure, ai amless and superficial i am not shy, and i am eloquent and talkative in front of people. i can easily manage social scenes, but i do not actually care how others think about me. i was diagnosed with depression since high school for years. i quit the medication few years ago because they are influencing my intelligence seriously, i am going to work in software development, and i would rather feel shit but have a functioning brain than living in an i willusion of relief and happiness caused by drug i born from a very conservative family in one of the east asian countries. i hate my country and escape to us to study and hope to settle here. i have been here years. now i am getting a master degree in us, and i wi will be interning at one of the prestigious software company in this summer. now, i realize that my hatred to my mother nation is pointless, my suffering is purely due to my unfitness to this world, and nothing to do with policy and culture i struggled through the hardest part of my depression by following these tips below. .keep a routine and stick to it, no matter how tire how shit you feel. a to do list such as i wi will wash clothes today at xxxx wi will help .abandon social network, they are toxic to your mental state. i only use it to share information rather than show off my fake good life or see anyone is fake good life. . leave toxic people, and yes, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. and give up on people, give up on hoping someone wi will magically show up and fix all your problems. . a healthy life style is very i amportant to keep you energy level up. eat good, sleep good, be active. . search on some higher purpose of life. i give up finding any happiness from human connection. i never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, thisappoint by people again again and again. then i stick my interests to machine, i study computer science and i am fascinated by technology. i develop a religious zealous of what a future world i want to create or envisioned i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. a world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. a world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding. that is why my major focus of my computer science degree is artificial intelligence, go figure. the current state of humanity is pathetic, and that is why there are so many depression on this earth. . then, accept that it is ok to never feel happy again. but the key to manage a life is not being always happy. i feel that i am more and more in the middle ground not happy not sad, but just nothing. in these years since i was diagnosed with depression, i find out a single truth. depression can never be gone and it can only be managed. i gradually accept the fact that i am just a machine, human body is in fact, just a machine and i would not feel the same happiness when i experience the same events like normal people do. i wi will feel nothing, but someti ame i feel that these kinds of nothingness is a form of tranquility. as long as i am not in constant pain and agony, i am fine with my current state. when people hurt me, i do not care. when people benefits me, i do not care. people are too predictable for me, and they are not i amportant anymore. the only exception is my parents because i feel sorry for them to suffer me however, after i live with these mindset for years, i gradually observe that not all people are asshole in nature. not all people are ignorant. i wi will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation. someone who are supposed to hurt me, do not act upon, or someone who are supposed to benefits me, do not act upon maybe as a person with depression, i can never experiences the joy of living with in this world. but it does not stop you to live out of this world, just treat it as a long boring trip on a train with randomly popping in objects of interests. it is not hard at all to get used to this.	severe
please make it stop. everyti ame i try to get help it always ends the same, i am shoved into countless psychiatrist offices and then they try to diagnose me with something i already know i have. i got so sick of it i asked one of them can you make it stop? i do not want to hurt anymore. and she just asked me more questions. i do not want to move, breathe, exist, be depressed, be happy, or be this face anymore. maybe i am just born to be alone, and a background character in somebody else is more i amportant life. i am a pawn in this world.	severe

i think i am having a long, drawn out nervous breakdown i am irrational, terrified, triggered and having extreme mood swings. i have childhood trauma that stems from isolation from my family and my mother has recently decided she is getting married and her and her son and her partner are a perfect little family unit. i have been dealing with a year long depressive episode and i have been on a bunch of different meds and none of them are fucking working. but no one gives a shit because at least i am not actively suicidal. i feel like i am getting close to it though. i am ready to take all my medication or step in front of a bus. i am all pent up and angry sad at the same ti ame and i know ki willing myself is not the answer but i feel utterly unable to carry on the path i am on right now. this is so stupid. if you re reading this just ignore me or whatever. i just wanted to get it all out.	severe
goodbye is it normal that i have come to terms with dying? i feel like most people on the day of their fucking suicide do not feel so... calm. and peaceful. i am just sat on the bus listening to music on the way to steal boxes of ibuprofen. if brought me close to death last ti ame i feel like more wi will do the job. i was diagnosed with bipolar the other month. everything makes sense. i am tired of the constant ups and downs. every ti ame i think i am recovering and doing better it turns out i was just manic and then i go back to feeling like pure shit. i have been waiting on meds for weeks and i can not take it anymore. i would rather not be thrown back in hospital. i just want it all to end. i know that i am not okay, i am a mental fucking wreck, but somehow even now all of it is bottled up and i sti will have my usual happy face on. it is funny because i was not even planning on doing this for long, but last night i went out and got fucking pissed and almost had fucking sex with my best friend, i am literally fucking gay and as much as i love her i feel fucking thisgusted with myself. i did not even know what was going on i was so out of it. i do not blame her but i mean... now it is official, my social life is fallen apart. all my other friends hate me and constantly talk about me behind my back and now the other friend thinks we re what? in a relationship? i do not know but it is confusing and pushing me over the edge. i am going to fail my gcses because i am fucking stupid and i wi will have no future. how the fuck am i going to be a doctor if i can not even look after my own health? i do not even know why i am spi willing everything out here. probably because if i told anyone i know they would ring the police on me or something. either way, reddit, thanks for being here for me when nobody else was. for thistracting me when i felt like this in the past. sadly i do not think thistractions are enough at this point. sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but... peace out lads.	severe

i want to die and do not want help i do not know what the point of this post is, random people can not really help with the issue. i have been depressed since around , started taking meds at and stopped at . i am about to turn . in those years i have wanted to die, to ki will myself. i visualize it happening and ever since i was it felt like it was destined to happen. i sti will think this way. i was closed off and alone my whole life, i have no social ski wills and can be pretty emotionally unstable if i do not put walls up and just be indifferent to everything. this helped me avoid too many suicidal ideations in high school, but when i went to college i resolved to talk to a therapist and psychiatrist, and be open and try to make my empty life less empty. it failed, the meds did not help. i was being emotionally open and connected with people, made some friends and even a boyfriend and lost them all due to my intense mood swings and bouts of suicidal actions. i tried to ki will myself twice in then dropped out of college because i missed so much class from hospitalizations. i shut off and i am back to being empty and not interacting with people. i can not do it. i have no support network, i need to be alone and sad because it is more stable and less dangerous than the alternative. as i realized this and started taking classes online, i know i wi will ki will myself in years if i continue this way. i want to get some job, move away so my parents do not find the body, and work up the nerve to do things right this ti ame. every few months i feel this want to die or to cease to exist become stronger and i am doing nothing to fix it. do i even want help? do i think i can be helped? i do not know anymore. all i know is that trying to get better made things so much worse, i do not have a stable enough support network to try that again. truthfully no one thinks about me and no one cares to talk with me, i have actively isolated myself and done a job. does it stop? can it even stop if i do not do something different? i can not would not do anything different so am i just going to keep daydreaming about dying as it becomes more and more of a reality? i am pathetic and a lost cause, and i wish every night that i just would not wake up. i deserve to be dead, the only thing i am worthwhile as is worm food. as dumb and bad as it sounds, i either do not want help or think i deserve help can be helped. so that is it. one day hopefully soon i wi will pass without fanfare or a note and no one wi will even notice.	severe
 question how to deal with loneliness emptiness inside? been depressed for years now, i live with an amazing father that supports me no matter what but he only stays home for one day in the week because he is my only financial support, and almost every day i spend my day alone. i have friends, but only a few know about my depression, and someti ames i just feel like my rants are just annoying. i do not really go out, because i do not know where to go. i play games just to thistract myself but that is only temporary. i started dating, online dating, i thought maybe finding someone that i connect with, that i can meet up have a good ti ame with and eventually have something beautiful like an actual relationship would be helpful to the loneliness emptiness inside, but so far it is not going well, people are just looking for something else in life i guess, can not even have a conversation anymore lol. so i do not know what to do anymore, more friends is not the thing that i want, i just lay in bed everyday listening to music, or just sit at my desk playing games to cope with the loneliness, but at the end of the day i just sti will feel it, i make music as a hobby but that is more a stress relief. do you guys have any ideas to deal with this?	severe
it is hard to do the right thing when all you want is the pain to go away. i suffer from a lot of issues i have been sick since before i was born, in fact it is a miracle that i even survived birth and even more of a miracle that i am sti will alive at . they did not know anything that was wrong with me for sure until i was when they thiscovered a rare partial chromosome deletion that ki wills of the babies in the womb, and of the survivors in childhood. so the of us who live two adults typically also have a lot of mental and physical issues along with an extremely weak i ammune system. thankfully somehow i ended up with a very high iq and not needing be in a extremely special needs classroom. i actually worked for many years the extremely special needs classroom and looking at the students that i could have very easily been one of them is very eye opening and i think sympathy was help me a lot of being a teacher to them. unfortunately last april i had to stop working because by issues got so bad as it was so sick i could not a whole day at work. most days now a day i am bedridden because of how sick i am and how much pain i am in. because my home is it issue is so rare the fact that i do not even fit the textbook case for my chromosome deletion the doctors have no clue how to help me, besides just giving me lots of meds to help with the symptoms because they can not help with the cause, because they do not really know what the cause is. when you see multiple doctors a week and you constantly are told by doctors that they no longer want to see you as a patient because there is nothing they can do to help so there is no reason to keep seeing them, they just tell you to see another doctor but they are the fifth or th or even more in the line of doctor saying should go see this doctor instead because i can not help, even though they were the last suggestion. in the last two years i have seen it least so good g.i. doctors and the last one just turned me down as a patient last. some of the meds they have me on are multiple opioids, muscle relaxers, pain ki willers, and more. everyone keeps warning me that i am going to be addicted but that is not the case in fact i tried to take as few of them as i can and save them up in case something happens in the future i need them or i can not get my meds right away which is happened do you stupid insurance. some days thought i want to take the more, i want the pain both mentally and physically to be gone. but i have been good so far i am not taking any extra. right now i am sti will under control with my meds, some days i wish i did not have this much control.	severe
i feel like i am in a constant vicious cycle with my depression and anxiety. it never ends. i struggle leaving the house most days. i try and push myself to go to a social events like going for a meal for a relative is birthday but i constantly worry about it beforehand. anticipating who is going to be there, trying to prepare myself to what questions i might be asked and how to answer them. the night before i usually try and talk myself out of going and cry a lot. i feel like i am on the edge of tears when i am there. feeling like i do not fit in or that i do not communicate with everyone properly. that is when the dark thoughts pop in to my head like they would be better off without me and no one would have to deal with the way i am. when i get back home, i do not feel safe, my mind if working overdrive analysing everything i said or did. it is so exhausting. after that i just want to sleep for days. i know the next ti ame i go out again i wi will feel the same, it is not getting easier. it is just hard to be motivated to keep going when i struggle to even go out for a family meal.	severe
wellbutrin sertraline works well but the bodyload is awful! i have been on sertraline mg a day for the last years. i started taking it after struggling with depression for at least two years and ocd since at least elementary school. i did not expect much but it made my life much more livable. my ocd symptoms vanished into thin air and i have became quite content with my life. but while being generally content, not all symptoms of my depression thisappeared. i sti will regularly slept for at least hours a day, became totally tired early on during the day, and sti will had little focus or motivation to do anything that would have advanced my life in a better directions. so after years of living my life as an involuntary slacker, i told my doctor about my symptoms and he gave me a prescription for wellbutrin mg a day . again it worked quite well. while the focus took some ti ame to finally return, the sleepiness vanished soon after starting it. i was quite happy that it worked so well, and at first i did not get any harsh side effects that i have read about. i have only been slightly confused at the beginning, and had some kind of mental fog, dizziness and only some slight memory loss at ti ames. but after two to three weeks i started to get head, muscle and some really terrible joint aches. the headaches remained only for a few days, but the muscle and joint aches now have stayed the about the same for at least two weeks. i suspect that they got slightly better but i am not totally sure. i would like to continue the medication since it works so well with respect to my symptoms but i am not sure whether the side effects wi will go away. i wi will of course talk to my psychiatrist about it at our next meeting. did you have si amilar experiences with wellbutrin? did the side effects eventually go away? did you get any further side effects later on?	severe
life is overrated i amo. my life is not precious and i amportant. when people say life is precious and i amportant, i just did not understand that and become baffled. what does it matter if i die today or some years later. eventually we all have to die, it is an ugly truth, but we can not do anything to prevent death. about months ago i started medication for my bipolar thisorder which was prescribed by a psychiatrist. them meds gave me terrible side effects, produced anhedonia in me, ki willed my sex drive, made me asexual, and gave me some other sexual side effects such as erectile dysfunction and unable to orgasm. there is no enjoy or pleasure in anything for me. i lost interest in everything. i feel guilty for taking medication. i should not have taken them. now months after stopping the medicines, i am unable to get rid of the above mentioned side effects. due to these side effects, i get suicidal thoughts. can anyone relate? is anybody suffering the same as me? i just want to get rid of these side effects. i do not want to live like that. anybody have any advice for me?	severe

i am really trying anything i can but it just feels like my self esteem just sinks and sinks, what am i doing wrong? the break up with my first girlfriend was a month long struggle. so much bad stuff happened, that after the real end i am left with nothing. i dont have any friends anymore, i dont have anyone to talk to except perhaps my psychologist. i am struggling to even get my high school graduation, because i weren t able to go to school for a month because of my mental health. i am probably at the lowest point ever in my life and i want to do anything to get out. i am trying to workout so i dont hate my body that much anymore, i am eating healthy, i am going to school to get my graduation, i got into old hobbys that helped me cope with my self hatred for a long ti ame, i am trying to learn new stuff and i am even trying to find new contacts. but nothing works i sti will feel like shit and i hate myself, i really fucking do. i sti will hate my body no matter how many muscles i have, i am eating healthy for that exact reason, going to school every day is the worst part because i am sitting there and just one wrong thought is sending me down a spiral of self loathing and self hatred were i nearly begin to cry and can not follow the class at all. what is going to make my final exams not really easier. i dont even have friends in school, i always relied on my friends when i am at home and didnt care about the people in school but now that i dont have anyone i just hurts so bad going to school and nobody, nobody wants to even talk with you. and even though my old hobby is are fun they are not making me feel less empty and the new stuff i am trying to learn is just frustrating just like with anything i can not expect to be good at it from the get go but what would be exactly what i need right now. and even if i am just not able to be proud of myself at the moment so much bad stuff happened that just left me hurt. i dont know what to do that break up was so bad my mental state was compleatly fucked in the process. it feels like i can not live without a girlfriend, it just feels like i need someone that actually tells me how much i am worth, that i am special, that i am a kind and unique person, that i am deserving of being loved. i just want someone to give me hug and that i feel loved, that i dont have to be ashamed of my body and that just gets rid of all these thoughts. but that is so messed up, why do i need other people to tell me all that? i want to be able to love myself not because other people tell me to but because i work hard. i want to love myself because i can be proud of myself. how can i do it what am i doing wrong? i dont want to rely on others isnt that the wrong way? what can i do? i am so lost and so confused, what can i do?	severe
my experience with cold showers some background i have a girlfriend whom i live together with, i study and have several job commitments. i think i might suffer from dysthymia, so i am generally considered high functioning . so, during a long period caught in a depressive state i decided one day to take a cold shower, and it proved to be a slightly life altering experience. before this i had ti ames where i would go days without showering and starting the day way too late which resulted in me doing half assed work and generally neglecting all the things i consider i amportant. i start by taking a hot shower, to properly wash my hair, face, armpits and junk. i then finish off by suddenly switching to ice cold water, while standing sti will, focusing on my breath. it is very uncomfortable to begin with, but i feel a surge of energy, alertness and warmth ! thereafter. it feels very nice to step out of the shower afterwards. some days i hardly want to do it, but as long as i commit to getting in the shower, and then commit to changing the temperature, i am all set for an opti amized morning. it has now become a habit, and i can not do without. the feeling of getting out of a warm shower is just a bummer compared to getting out of a cold one. if mornings are especially hard for you, i suggest you try out a cold shower. do not make it too cold the first few ti ames, and do not stay too long in the cold water. focus on your breath and relax your muscles as you re showering. to the people who decides to give it a go, i wish for you a positive and uplifting experience. please share your experiences! was it pleasant or unpleasant? how did it feel after? would you do it again?	severe
get i ammediately stressed over short messages upon re reading this, i know this is probably more anxiety related than depression related. i apologise currently i really do not have too many friends. at all. i have no friends in real life that i talk to, outside of occasional classmates, and online i have one friend i speak to very very occasionally. she does not often like to talk to me too often, which is okay, she makes more of an effort than a lot of other people do. despite knowing i do not really have any close knit friends, i do try to reach out to people. whether it be people i used to talk to frequently, or people who i want to try to get to know, i do actively try to talk to people and make new friends. but after the first message i just feel insane amounts of guilt and anxiety over it. i get pissed off with myself, internally bereating myself like why the fuck are you sending them a message? you know they do not want to talk to you, if they did they would have said hello in the past years . then usually when getting replies i feel even worse. they are pretty short heys or cool or one word answers i can just feel are the other person going literally what do you want from me? i feel so goddamn lonely. and i am constantly in this battle between look just do not talk to anybody at all and only speak when spoken to and look you need to make an effort with people for them to like you . and i try to make an effort, but i just can not strike properly with literally anybody. not online, not even in real life. i wish i could stop wanting to have people care about me. i wish i could be okay with just not having anybody in my life. i feel like such a failure even without the fact i can not connect with a single person in my same species. apologies for the rant, thank you for reading.	severe
my birthday, that day something snapped. punched a damn hole in my wall due to overwhelming emotions. i thought everything was sti will, you know, quiet at least. but i can feel something within me. i felt it on my birthday but i thought it was another wave of anxiety like normal. but over the past few days i feel so much rage and negativity. so bad that my mother and close friends noticed and pointed it out. i get lost in monologue about why i hate certain things and suddenly i realize what i am saying and cut myself off. i honestly do not know what is going on but i am trying to keep it contained. i have been focusing on little victories like smiling, writing again and pushing myself to carry on conversations, helping others. maybe i have finally lost it. full blown personality shifts. thoughts that are not mine. opinions that are not mine. maybe i have gone insane and do not know it yet. do not know if i even would. yesterday i got overwhelmed by anxiety and depression and rage i punched a hole in my wall. had to cover it up with old pictures i have drawn. have not told anyone in my home yet. i do not want my mom to know it is gotten worse. especially when i am almost certain i can contain it. i just have to keep doing good things. thistract myself from all this shit. that is pretty much all i wanted to say on this post. i wi will talk more later more than likely, typing keeps me busy as well as not bottling what is going on.	severe
i feel so empty i just broke up with my boyfriend and i feel nothing, i cried but felt nothing. there was no passion on my side, i miss that passion, that obsession. once i gave a guy bucks for hi am to kiss me, i used to be obsessed with that guy, and i think that if i see hi am again my feelings wi will grow again, but he was an asshole, a homeless bipolar schizophrenic asshole, and i loved it. i could relate to hi am, see his mental struggle. i would tell all the reasons i liked hi am but that is not the point. the point is, it is not healthy to be obsessed, i think i just want to have a thistraction, something to thistract my heart. idk what to do with my life, i am doing nothing atm, i do not go to school, i do not have a job, i spend most of my ti ame home i am doing exams to do th grade but did not study shit yet and i am depressed and lonely and empty. but tbh, i kinda like feeling those things, it makes me feel truly like a human being, if i was a character from a movie or tv show, i think i would be my favorite character. i think i want to write a book about my life and my struggles but depression does not let me, i like to write and i can be good at it, but for some reason, i never ended a single story, why? idk, maybe i get bored, or lack ideas, maybe i am just shit at writing. i really think i want to write a book about my life and as always, that is a thistraction but i want to do it, i need thistractions or i wi will go crazy, maybe i wi will never end it, probably i would not since i started stories and finished none but i sti will have faith i wi will finish something. but for that i would need to organize my ideas, with a psychologist, i talked with my mom to come back to one, and i think i want her to help me write my book, to organize my ideas. idk why i made this post, i think i just want to hear you guys thoughts on this and your experiences, idk if anyone wi will respond but i wi will really appreciate if you did. thank you for reading.	severe
how to cope after decades of depression and no viable hope for the future? hello! i feel a bit of background story is in order. i have been with depression and gad since i was about i turn this year . someti ames it gets a little better, someti ames it gets a little worse. except now it is a lot worse. not the worst, but heading there. i can not seem to cope these days, thoughts of ending it all are frequent, no matter how much i talk to my therapist i do talk therapy and have medications , no matter how much i read self help articles, i take my pi wills as prescribed, nothing is helping. my therapist says that not having enough money is a major trigger for me, which is true, since i grew up poor and am now struggling to make ends meet. does anyone have any advice on how to pick myself up when everything around me is broken or sellotaped together? nothing works and i have no money to fix it... i am not a materialistic person, i just think i have hit my li amit at how much i can take... for a bit more background i f, live in a studio apartment that my grandmother left me, it is legally mine, so i do not pay rent, only property taxes twice a year. i am unemployed and looking for a job for about a year now, but nobody wants to hire me. i live off of what i make by backing cakes for people and babysitting for neighbours. i am not poor, but i think the situation of not seeing a way out of this day to day living is getting to me. i feel so worthless and helpless, pathetic and sad... i am wi willing to work, i promise, only nobody wants to hire me... i apologise if something does not make much sense, i feel jumbled and english is not my first language. not an excuse, but just know it is not intentional. thank you to all in advance, xx	severe

much happier girl now? hi guys, for the last couple years i was super depressed and it was hard finding people to talk to because they would not see it as a problem, either girls would tell me they wish they had that problem or guys would contribute to the problem for the most part. i do not want come off as narcissist but people find me very attractive and my larger chest area does not help. i realized since i was perhaps a freshman in high school. senior guys inviting me to parties, male teachers giving me special privileges and occasionally their eyes would wander away from my face. i did not really see a huge problem until i got to college. i wanted to date, find a nice guy to treat me right and i found it was super hard. the majority of guys that i talked to weren t looking for anything more than a hookup. some guys respected the fact that i did not want a hookup but the majority of guys would go along and pretend to want more when in reality they did not. when i would ask to get to know each other more before we do anything, i would be called a tease, accused of leading them on and told hurtful stuff like i am sure other guys have been in your pants, why can not i get some do you know how hurtful that is. and eventually, complements meant nothing to me, i would get so many and they all felt sexual in nature. they were all based off my looks and nothing more. guys with girlfriends were a lot of ti ames the worst, if they saw me talking to their boyfriends, they would get super jealous, if we re studying for a test together, they assumed i am trying to take their man. i would never try to get in between someone is relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me, i wi will do my best to make hi am know i am not interested but i am not responsible for his actions so do not get upset at me. and a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and i am not. or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird. then things got worst how people assumed things i get stuff based off my looks strictly. like i am not going to lie people have given me special treatment but i have never requested it and i have never depended on it, i have always been dedicated to working hard and earning what i want. i remember my sophomore year i was taking a number theory class which is harder than it sounds. i took a test, the mean score was about a and i got a and a girl clai amed i got a high grade based of my looks. i studied hard for that, i tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined. on my test, the problems were done correctly, and she clai amed it was based of my looks. that was just so hurtful. as ti ame went on it just bothered, and i became depressed off of it based off the idea that i did not think i could ever find love. i am a start girl, pretty but i felt like i could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions. it just felt like that is all guys saw me for. and i know looks fade as ti ame go, i do not want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends, or realizes that i would not always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually. and i could not talk to people. girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem, and guys would always listen and the next week they are asking for pictures of my breast. and my family did not make things better either always asking why i do not have a boyfriend, it must be so easy for me. that just always bothered me and brought me down significan notly, i was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone. that was something that bothered me until last year. one day my car battery died at school and a friend and i were outside for about thirty minutes trying to jumpstart it. but she drove a weird jeep and you had to unscrew stuff to get to the battery so we were there for a while. eventually this guy came but and asked if we needed help, he has a portable battery in his car. i assumed he was just another guy trying to get into my pants. but that was not the case. he came over and actually helped, he knew what he was doing. we talked a bit afterwards, found out we used to live in the same area. he is a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he is an economics major with a math minor. then he said he had to go, he did not get my name or ask for my snapchat like most guys do. there was just something about hi am, the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return. i was somewhat attracted to hi am. luckily, i started seeing hi am on campus all the ti ame and we would wave to each other. eventually i got brave enough to go and talk to hi am and i did. we became friends and started talking a lot, he was super kind, funny and a weird sense of charisma. and i started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies. one thing led to another and we have been dating since then. this man treat me right, makes me so happy, makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body. every conversation is not just about sex, he actually listen to me. asks about my dreams and aspirations and i feel so comfortable around hi am. every once in a while i do catch his eye wandering away but with hi am, i do enjoy it and someti ames his eyes would stay there a bit longer after i catch hi am haha. his complements mean much more to me, because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants. i love this guy a lot, and i generally do not advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression. but i am this specific case it helped me, i am so happy with hi am and i could see us lasting and i would like it to and he feels the same. but at the same ti ame i do know that if for some unfortunate reason we do not work out at the very least there are great guys out there.	severe
i do not know how to help her. my friend told most of our friend group that she is depressed and this happens all the ti ame. she likes a boy, they reject her, then she comes back to school really depressed, saying things like i want to die and when she is in a good mood, she makes suicidal jokes that are not funny because we do not know whether she is serious or not. whenever she makes a joke like that or talks about her problems, everyone is happy mood thisappears. i do not think it is bad to vent, but i just think there is a right ti ame for everything. when we re talking about funny stories together, you do not all of a sudden say, haha yeah, i want to die. instead of telling everyone, tell one person you think wi will help the most, hey, can we talk privately? because not everyone knows how to deal with your problem and wi will instead make them feel like it is their fault you re not feeling better. i do not want to tell anyone who is depressed this because i have a feeling it wi will just make them feel worse. i have been trying to help her, telling her to take a break from dating, but i feel like my words never reach her and it just makes me feel bad that she has not progressed. yes, i wi will carry the burden with her and help, but when i see that carrying the burden and helping her is not making her feel any better, i get depressed as well. she would not tell me what to do to make her feel better, and when i do tell her how to feel better, she just keeps doing what makes her feel bad dating. i do not know how to break it to her.	severe

i do not know how to cope anymore i have been diagnosed with chronic depression at the age of . i am now and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety thisorder too a few years back. in the past it was not so difficult to go through the day because i had school and was busy all the ti ame. apart from my social anxiety and awkwardness i sti will had friends and a semi normal life. my strict parents did prevent me from doing things with my friends. so i ended up losing most of them when i got out of school. i ended up dating a guy my first official bf for almost years, we broke up last year. it left me in pieces and i am sti will not over it. i can not connect to anyone emotionally anymore guys . also, my best friend got into a friend is with benefits relationship and kept choosing hi am above me even though i was there every ti ame he hurt her. she chased me away when i wanted to spend ti ame with her so she can be with hi am. so i decided, because of this continuous toxic behaviour i am not going to put in any effort to be her friend anymore. i overthink a lot. i get angry easily. i cut people off very easily. and i know it is my own fault that i am losing people around me. i know i am a shitty person. i hate myself. i do not know how to cope anymore people around me because i feel like eventually they see what a bad person i am and just leave me. i have just always felt like i do not deserve to have people in my life that care. that supports me. i have always done everything on my own. the only people that i do believe support me are my parents, my brother and some other family members. i have tried to commit suicide multiple ti ames. i think about it on a daily basis. i can not see myself having a normal future so what is the point of living. how do you live with yourself if you re toxic on the inside and all you do is self criticize, self hate, thislike people and see everything negatively. i get up in the morning and i am fine but somehow i just keep losing myself more and more each day. i try making myself happy by being financially independent to a degree, having a job, having my own pet, starting my studies soon. but at the end of the day all the bad things end up bothering me so much and i make everything seem so much worse than it probably is. and i have seen therapists but i si amply can not afford it and it does not seem to help anymore because my depression keeps changing and evolving. sorry for the long post... tl dr i am majorly depressed and i do not know how to cope with practically no more friends left, a strong hatred for myself and a tendency to overthink and catastrophize everything. yes i have seen therapists.	severe

i wi will ki will myself within days i wi will turn this tuesday. i gave myself enough ti ame. nothing happened. i have tried reaching out and seeking help. people do not really care. even if they say they do, they never show it in action. i posted another cry for help on reddit before with another account but moderators deleted it for no reason before someone even replies. i have tried therapy, psychiatrists did not help. in fact, opening up to people actually made it worse. i just want people to consider my mental condition and treat me better instead of giving me advice. but at least after therapy i know that i have autism, psychotic depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, ocd, maladaptive daydreaming thisorder and borderline personality thisorder. i think i have thissociative identity thisorder. i know what is happening when one of my other personalities is controlling me, but i have no control over what thay say or what they do. one of my psychiatrists said i am just too schizophrenic . i can not communicate with people. i can not have long lasting friendships. i have never felt loved and i do not even know what it means or feels like. i do not feel empathy or sympathy. i gave myself ti ame to think about this. i realized something i do not want to just end the pain, i do not want to live. i am tired of waking up and trying to survive the day just to do the same repetitive things that i do everyday. i do not want a job, i do not want money, i do not want to graduate. i seriously do not want anything from life. but that is not the worst part. i live in iran. in iran when guys turn they have to go to military academy for years or you can keep graduating and then go to military academy after you re done, but it is a rule and you can not escape from it . i can not even i amagine years without my pc. after all it is one of the things that kept me alive. i wish i could live in another country, but that needs a lot of money and i have to take ielts test and go to military academy anyway. otherwise i am stuck here. hold on a second... if i live in another country i need a job, so it would be pointless. the other thing that kept or maybe keeps me alive is my daydreaming. real life is very boring and repetitive. if i could live in my daydreaming forever, it would be nice. something like a different world which i could live in. people in my daydreams are all fictional characters and i like them more than real life people. that is why i can not just quit it and go find real friends. they actually helped me a bit with their emotional support. there is no other way. nothing wi will change if i stay alive, and i can not change anything myself. no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i want it, the story of my life does not have a good ending. i wanted to give myself more year, but that is just pointless. i wi will ki will myself on my birthday. now do not tell me i have so much to live for, everything wi will be okay, it wi will end someday. tell me whatever you think is actually helpful. only if my post would not be deleted like before.	severe

do not know whether or not i should switch medication i have been on my medication mirtazapine for about months now and honestly i really like it, i feel like myself again, less anxious and overall less low, however, since going on this particular medication i have gained a fair bit of weight, so much that for the first ti ame in my life i am overweight, i really wish i could say this did not bother me, but sadly for a long ti ame i have had an unhealthy relationship with my body, even having buli amia for several years, so as you can probably tell this has really affected me. the problem is i am really struggling to lose weight with it. i have been going the gym ti ames a week, and working out at home ti ames a week, cutting down my calories and somewhat trying to i amprove my diet, but i have ended up gaining even more weight, i am thistraught if you can not tell. because of all this, i do not know whether changing my medication would be better for myself or not, anyone else had any si amilar experiences or even just some advice?	severe
being tired all the ti ame? i am diagnosed with depression amp have been for maybe years , i feel better amp then have episodes like everyone. but even when i am not having a depressive episode and i am functioning enough to go to work etc i am exhausted all the ti ame. it is been like this for over years. people always say i sleep a lot. i just want to be in bed or asleep all the ti ame. even when i am spending ti ame with people i love and enjoying myself i just feel like i need to be in bed. i feel like i need to sleep whenever i am not at work amp i get a bit irritable if i can not just sleep. but theres no reason for this. when i make plans i am really excited for them but the the day comes and it is like i have to be in bed and sleep like i no longer want to do anything, it sucks so much, i do not want my favorite thing to be sleeping but all i ever want to do is sleep i am thinking of course i could have a vitamin deficiency but could this be my depression? does anyone else experience this?	severe
am i depressed? my family thinks i might have depression, but i am not sure. i suffer from extreme depersonalization and i just started talking about it with my family. it turns out my dad went through the same thing when he was my age and it did not go away until he started taking anti depressants. my family has a long history of mental health issues and i am guessing they passed it on to me. i am unmotivated to do anything, and i mean anything. even if it is something i used to love doing i do not want to do it for some reason. i am like i can not wait to play video games when i get home. and when i get home i just lay in bed and sleep. i take ritalin that makes me extremely happy for about an hour and then sad the rest of the day. there is really no reason that i should be sad i just am. i am failing almost every class in school because when i start doing work i get unmotivated to finish it. i am just looking for some guidance, maybe some tips to overcome being unmotivated and hopefully overcome the depersonalization without the need for drugs.	severe

manifestation of symptoms hello beautiful people. i have been diagnosed with moderate depression years ago and was put on medication. years later i moved out from home. i seemed to have recovered by then. so treatment stopped. it was not entirely abrupt, but the weaning off procedure was not medically ideal either, because i rather took matters into my own hand. fast forward i think my depression never fully went away. i have not felt this typical emptiness or soul crushing sadness ever since i stopped treatment, but other symptoms come and go in a span of several weeks or months. the main one being i become lazy , everything costs me enormous amounts of energy. i have not really cleaned my flat for months. the laundry is piling on. i do the absolute mini amum of my responsibilities, someti ames not even that. personal hygiene goes out the window. indifference kicks in. i think i wi will be fairly active in this thread. maybe upload some before after pictures once i get myself to clean my flat.	severe
my sister almost successfully ki willed herself my sister had been struggling with depression, anxiety, and bipolar since i was . my sister would refuse to go to school, going a month at a ti ame not showering or brushing her teeth. i have had to stay up all night making sure she wouldn t try to run away. i have had to be a third parent to her. i have had to witness the screaming, the breaking of thishes, walls being smashed in and written on with red sharpie reading its all your fault over and over and over and over. the stress of my household made me extremely depressed and physically i will all the ti ame. i am going to keep this part straightforward. i was , my sister was , the night started with me trying to calm my sister who was hysterically crying in the midst of a panic attack while my parents slept in the next room over. i calmed her down. she told me she thought her friend had ki willed themself because they had not responded to her text. she said she would never ki will herself because she did not want me to feel how she felt. what happened between this moment and the morning are fuzzy. i went to bed, and woke up to a note from my parents telling me to call them. my sister overdosed on pi wills that night. she was seizing in the hospital, had to be restrained to the table with a tube down her throat. i can not express how traumatic it was to visit her the next day, she was screaming for her life, her eyes manically darting around the room as if some monster invisible to the rest of us was tormenting her. she begged the nurses to let her die. to my sister, i am sorry if you find this i never ever blamed you, i do not resent you i love you 	severe

random question, but who here feels like you almost want to be depressed, and you feel bad for not being as depressed as others? i have personally been on anti depressants for about three months and they have not done anything apart from just make me physically incapable of feeling depressed. and that is not a good thing. depression breaks through someti ames, but it is really rare. i do not really know why, but it is almost like i miss feeling sad. i miss never being happy. i miss being able to think about me dying, and it is weirdly hard to do that now i am on medication. and the fact that i miss that just terrifies me. i mean, i always knew that i was a really horrible person, but was i seriously faking being depressed all this ti ame just so i could feel special, or so i did not have to take responsibility for my laziness and just other shitty qualities? someti ames when i am feeling good for my standards about myself i think that i am actually depressed and that me thinking i am not is just a symptom of depression but i have my doubts about that. i do not know, i am just so confused right now. and then on places like this subreddit, i read about people who are really suffering and i feel like shit for not exhibiting the exact same symptoms that they do. i know there is a massive amount of different types of depression and nobody wi will have the same experiences, but it is almost like i use every single scrap of evidence to try to prove to myself that i have been faking it and i am a terrible person and all of that crap. and then i feel bad for thinking that it is me just cherry picking evidence because deep down i know that i am faking it and it is just me trying to justify it by cherry picking evidence about me cherry picking evidence and.... i do not even know. i feel like my brain is just completely broken anyway, sorry for making you read all that incoherent garbage lol. but i was honestly just wondering if anybody else here has these kind of thoughts, like you re faking it all just for attention, and the fact that you do not have every single possible symptom of depression and mental i willnesses in general makes you feel bad. but to be honest, it is probably just me	severe
antidepressant not working? hey i am a year old man who has struggled with anxiety and depression for all my life. it would take too long to tell you about all the issues i have faced but in summary i suffer from ocd, bdd, gad and physical pain most notably severe nerve pain in my left arm which has caused me to become anxious and depressed. in december i finally realized that this was not going to go away by itself and all the therapy talks and cbt was not helping. i went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed lexapro which i was on for weeks first weeks i was on mg day, and then mg day . i did not really develop a good rapport with this psychiatrist so i changed to another one who i really like. on lexapro i felt that my mood was elevated and even my anxiety depression started to i amprove a little but the effect was kinda shortlived and because of sexual side effects took forever to ejaculate and fatigue, my psychiatrist recommended me to switch to another medication called trintellix vortioxetine . i quit lexapro cold turkey and started trintellix mg day instead. once again i felt my mood elevate and anxiety depression i amprove but after weeks i was back to baseline and a week after that i increased my dose to mg day and the same thing happened again good weeks then back to baseline. i have been on trintellix mg day for three weeks now and i mentally feel pretty bad honestly. i do not have sexual side effects which is great, although i suffer from erection pain due to a botched circumcision hopefully wi will do some foreskin restoration to get more skin and decrease pain in the future need surgery first to remove scarring . i sti will am tired and have issues with concentration which is not great since i am in medical school although i am on medical leave now but i was thinking long term it would be a problem. what is bothering me most though at the moment is the pain i suffer in my arm which was caused by a bothed blood draw basically the nurse hit a nerve in my arm and more than three years later i am sti will in pain i know i am not the luckiest guy alive haha... . due to my ocd and general frustration i actually aggravated that injury by constantly pushing and aggressively stretching out my arm stopped with that now but yeah i made the situation worse. the trintellix has helped with anxiety but everyday i am in pain and it is weighing heavily on my mind besides hurting a lot. i would say it is the biggest contributing factor to my depression and it makes me devoid of energy and i have no wi will to do anything the only relief i get is when i am in my bed or sleeping. i have tried to keep up the hope that it wi will go away but after three years it is unlikely. my psychiatrist said i needed to accept my injury and the pain but how do i do that? i read online about treatments for nerve pain and the antidepressant amitriptyline came up often but it seems to have so many side effects... and as strange as it sounds i do not like the idea of medicating against the pain i want it to go away by itself. in summary i am in a bad place not really knowing what the next step should be. i was planning on going up to mg day which is max dose for trintellix and perhaps combining that medication with a sti amulant like modafinil which does not seem to interact with trintellix, which adderall, ritalin, vyvanse etc... seem to do, in order to combat my fatigue and concentration issues. what do you think of this plan? i feel the big issue is the nerve pain but i do not know if you can even treat that? any other tips for me? thank you for reading!	severe

not really depressed i feel like i am faking my depression someti ames.i was diagnosed by my doctor years ago when i was at my worst.i was empty,cold,and really did not care about life.my depression seems to fluctuate now.i do not always feel sad but i am not always happy i am just in the middle.i wi will get suicidal thoughts someti ames usually at night .they are usually linked to my dysphoria i am ftm transgender like it would be easier to be dead than feel this way.i would never ki will myself though.even at my worst when that thought was almost always on my mind i never tried anything.and that makes me feel like i am faking it.i know it is dumb but that is how i feel.i do not want to whine and complain about how difficult it is being trans but it is not si ample or fun.i wi will never be a biological man...and that hurts.that is where the thoughts come from.my heart feels broken.i feel like a liar because i am not constantly depressed and that causes more depression and anxiety.i just needed to rant ig.thnks for reading if you did.	severe
i need to rant i am a year old female. not only do i have depression, but i have adhd as well, which is a pretty bad mix. i also might be jumping all over the place. and my dad is most likely emotionally abusive. i am on medication, which really does help me, but i have been feeling depressed lately. because of my adhd, whenever i get bored, i also feel depressed. i read that that is pretty common in people with adhd. every year since th grade, each quarter i am good at keeping my grades up at first, and then weeks in, my grades go down, and everything becomes a chaotic downward spiral. i always say i wi will i amprove, but i do not. it is not that i am not an intelligent person, in fact, it is been proven that i have a pretty high iq, so my parents are always telling me that i should be doing better and that i am capable of it blah bleh blah. i tend to forget to turn things in a lot of the ti ame, and i do not always get things done in class. i have tried hard to block out a traumatic experience that occurred just about years ago, i was targeted by a sexual predator and i think i have forgotten more, but i sti will remember, but i do not think about it. i am really sorry. i am not sure how to explain it. i do not know what point i am trying to make. my anxiety, however, has gone down a great amount now that i am surrounded by friends, so i am happy about that. i hate talking to my psychiatrist and my therapist, i kind of want help, but i really do not if that makes sense i do not want to be sent somewhere again, i do not want to be put on more higher doses of medication, i do not want to be constantly under the microscope, i do not want somebody telling me why i feel the way i do when that is really not the reason why, i just do not want people to be constantly bugging me. i want to be comforted? by someone? that is not one of my parents, or any adult, i want to be close to someone, but i also do not? it is a feeling that i do not know how to describe. but i am just yet another depressed teenager, so whatever i guess.	severe

male , extreme mood swings today i woke up, did not take me long until i started getting all these different thoughts about different insecurities especially feeling alienated from pretty much everyone, feeling sorry about myself because i have a pretty rough life without much family or anyone i would call a true friend etc existential dreads anxiety about the future feeling like i would not be able to maintain this life any longer, with nothing good in the future worth looking for and some other stuff as well, i told myself to definitely go see a therapist, also i wanted to tell my family that i am depressed now comes the big but but now i do not feel like this at all? for reference i had the feelings i mentioned earlier about hours ago when i woke up, now it is night ti ame for me. i can not even really understand why those feelings were so strong this morning, i literally can not comprehend it. it is not like i am necessarily happy right now, i am just kinda apathic not in a strong way though, i just do not care about that stuff i thought a lot of very much rn i do not really know what i wanted to achieve with this post, i just needed to write this down somewhere as i have no one else to tell. maybe anyone knows what is going on with me? maybe someone struggles with the same problem?	severe

what is happening to me ? i feel like i am getting worse i am on sertraline and cymbalta. the last few days i have felt worse than ever. i am crying over everything , i am hating my life, everything is giving me anxiety attacks and i had the worst panic attack of my entire life yesterday. i am back in therapy which is great since my last therapist unexpectedly died , i like my new one and our first session was nearly hours .. i see her again in weeks. but i do not understand what is going on with me . it is like my meds have stopped working as of two days ago. has this happened to anyone before ? i have not cried this much in years. i am so sad and angry and i do not even know why. i feel so alone.	severe
first ti ame experiencing depression and do not know how to handle it hey. i wi will try to sum things up. in the beginning of my grandmother committed suicide and my whole family took it hard, especially my father. he spiraled as soon as it happened and almost went down the same path. i shut off could not read which i love , could not study, could not work, and it was senior year. thankfully i did get into college but i am a year in and it has been terrible. sti will can not study, failed a bunch of classes and hate my major. i have been getting worse and worse, so about months ago i started therapy i know, should have started as soon as it happened . it has been nice but the progress is very slow. i do not feel like myself anymore and everything i used to love doing does not feel nice anymore. the one thing i can sti will keep up with and that makes me happy is interacting with my horse. he is pretty much the love of my life and everything i do is about hi am including what i decided to major on . however, he got sick for the th ti ame he is very sensitive and the vets are saying he wi will have to retire and might lose quality of life. this was last week and it completely broke me. to top it off, my mother has always been my rock, but lately our relationship is terrible and i have never felt more alone. i do not feel comfortable reaching out to friends, i barely leave the house and i am feeling utterly useless and broken. i have exactly hope that things wi will get better and my mood ranges from wanting to ki will everyone to crying in a corner. i do not know how a reddit post wi will help, i have never done something like this, but i really needed to get this off my chest.	severe
 that is life i suffer from adhd, aspergers, ocd and anxiety. i have thoughts of suicide frequently. some of my mental thisorders keep me from doing i amportant things like work. i had to ask my manager to stop giving me night shifts because it would make me so depressed that suicide was always on my mind. i am not trying to make any excuses, but it is very difficult to live with these kind of conditions. and certain family members just do not seem to get it. some of them straight up think that i am lazy. i wi will tell hi am about the problems i have and they wi will respond with that is life. 	severe
losing the one person i never thought i would lose. i have suffered from depression for a very long ti ame. i have learned to cope in many healthy ways. i am finding it extremely difficult now that i have lost the one rock that i could always count on, my best friend. this person meant the world to me. their family did too. i was able to work through my depression by talking to, spending ti ame with, and feeling a part of something. i have also been in love with this person for a long ti ame. however, in my selfless ways, i never let that be a complication. until recent i found out they were terribly unhappy in their marriage for many different reasons. i was here for her to speak her mind, offered her sound advice as her friend kept the love i felt seperste. i respected her vulnerability and never compromised that. she then was so overwhelmed with everything and dropped the biggest blow on me that i have ever felt. she is been having an affair for a year and a half with some other guy. this crushed me and everything i ever knew. as a friend i was mad. as a lover i am heart broken. i feel horrible for her kids, for her husband. now, i feel sick. i feel broken. but this is not about me i kept telling myself. but then she said that this guy listened to her, was just like her, understood her, so on so forth. and then i ask, what was i to you through this ti ame? that was the hardest thing to hear her say. then she asked me, do you love me? at this point i knew things wi will never be the same and i said, yes . she said why did not you tell me... i felt the same way for a long ti ame... i said because you re married with kids and i never knew you were unhappy, besides i am not that guy to home wreck. i would never do that. i am better than that. i wanted to wait until she was settled and on her own two feet. but i would be there to help at all costs. and she knew that. now i am left with nothing. i do not have my friend. i would not ever have the love that i felt, be real. i have lost the relationship with a family that i care about. it wi will never be the same again... i can not shake this feeling of complete loneliness. i feel sick. i have no appetite. i can not feel anything. this level of depression is something i have not felt in a long ti ame. i have come here to just share... i know in ti ame this all wi will pass, i am just looking for somewhere to share what i can not share with anyone in my day to day. thank you in advance.	severe
are there small steps against depression? so i have been depressed for over a year now and only just found out because i adjusted my standard of living on my depression. now that i know, i have been feeling really awful because i have let it go this far . i was wondering if any of you have small steps for feeling just a tad better. i have heard things like clean your room and get up early but my depression withholds me physically from doing anything that is not necessary. lately i have been taking short walks to a field of grass which have been helping, but i always end up feeling worthless after all. i can not think of anything that wi will help, but i really want to start feeling good again. since i literally do not know how to do that anymore, i wanted to ask you guys if you have ideas or tricks you use to feel slightly better. i hope that with these small steps i can launch myself into actually, effortlessly feeling better.	severe
i lost a friend to suicide hey, friends. i wanted to share this in hopes that it helps just one person or puts things into perspective. two weeks ago i found out my friend passed away. he took his own life. i worked with hi am for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and hi am and i would go out by ourselves once a month or so. we weren t super close, but we were good friends. when he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. three weeks before he died, i called hi am up and asked for a huge favor. he lived within a mile of me and i needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted hi am to show me how. he had plans that night but said they could wait and he would be over within an hour. when he arrived, i asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. i asked if everything was okay and he said not really, but that is life! he helped me change the tire, i gave hi am a hug and told hi am we should get drinks soon. hi am and i had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so i wanted to be there for hi am. i did not reach out soon enough. when i heard the news i was in shock. i was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. when i drove home that night i cried. i took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that hi am and i would go to. i had to pull over because i was crying so hard. i was sobbing and screaming it would have been okay, i promise you. everything would have been okay. as if he could hear me. the next day, i had to leave work because i could not stop crying. i took the day after that off. i could not think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. whenever i was outside i would think that everything just felt different. the world feels different and empty without hi am in it. you always think about how sad your parents wi will be, your best friends, your so. he was not my best friend, we saw each other once every or months. even ex coworkers who had not seen hi am in a year are grieving massively. my coworkers and i arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and i witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. of us who worked with hi am showed up, one drove hours to be there. the others opted out because they were sti will struggling so much they wi will be attending the official memorial . my point is, death reaches so much further than you think it wi will. i have been there, and i know that when you re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life wi will be better off without you. i have also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. i also recognize that everyone has different struggles and i am not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. but experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to hi am were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. anyways, this was way longer than i expected. reach out to your friends and tell them you love them and are there for them, if you re in a place mentally where you are able to do so. and feel free to reach out to me personally if you are struggling.	severe

weighed down by my mental state i feel like i am such a burden to be around. i try to be light and not talk about heavy subjects to any of my friends even though i feel like i am boiling on the inside. everyti ame i open up i feel like the person i am talking to hates me and wants me to shut up. i really do not know what to do, but i need help and i want to get help. i have become so depressed to the point where i ditch school, stopped attending all extracurriculars, blow off all my friends etc. i have potential yet negative thoughts and si ample actions being exhilarating are holding me back. the only good thing about me is that i am able to see things somewhat objectively and i want to get myself out of this pit. i can not go to a psychiatrist since my mom is really against therapy due to bad experiences she had with it when she was young, and i truly feel like i have no one to talk to.	severe
monster and depression so i became extremely depressed around christmas of , and i have gotten a little better but every now and then i get really bad moods swings, and having adhd does not help one bit. i drink monster ablut once or twice a week, and i am completely fine until i start to crash then when i do i get extremely depressed and upset over nothing, i end up having a breakdown or loosing my train of thought and getting mixed with emotions. so yea i was just seeing if anyone else gets affected that way. also i just joined not to long ago, so yea i am ,male,bisexual, and currently have an amazing girlfriend who is the main reason i am getting better. so yea that is my life .	severe

i wish i would vanish into dust i am worn the hell out. i can feel the strings holding my very being together, beginning to untie and fall. it is like when you pull on a loose hoodie string too much and tear open the sleeve. it is fucking annoying. i just want to feel normal again, but i feel like a deflating balloon. my mom is stressed, and trying to find a job, and doing her best to support me i am transgender, ftm, in my ti ame of need. my dad does not accept me for who i am, and who i have been since i was conceived, and can not come to terms with the fact that the only little girl he had was a bag of bones and flesh, and does not value me as his child or as a person. my brother is ambitious, and seems to be at that stage where he is starting puberty and is either insanely hyper or insanely tired fucking grumpy or happy as a rabbit. he is terrifyingly ambitious and wants to do absolutely everything right this second, acting like he is got a bomb strapped to his chest and his ti ame is almost up. i just got back from the park with hi am, and when we were in the car, he asked my mom who was also with us if we could all me, mom, dad, and hi am, play uno. i am tired, and i decline. he gets pissy, saying i never do anything with hi am anymore, even though i just literally got done doing something with hi am, and that i am always hiding in my room. it pisses me off because he has no idea what the hell i am dealing with, and he loves to act as if he does. he loves to talk about how it is so sad that we never do anything as a family anymore, because of me, and i can not do shit about it. he does not know that i am dealing with depression that makes me want to sleep all day, makes me become easily bored with every want and need, makes me want to be left the fuck alone, and makes my head feels like it is caving in on itself because of the lack of happy chemicals in it. he does not know that i am dealing with trans guilt, that makes me almost unable to look my parents in the eyes anymore because of what my brain tells me i have done, because i have ki willed their daughter my dad is only daughter and that i am a thisappointment because i did not amount to what they would planned for me in my life, and how that makes me want to stay away because i am sick of my presence being used to fi will a room, and how i always seem to hurt people. he does not know that i am dealing with adhd, that is scrambled my brain like a fucking plate of eggs, and given me at least or f is in every fucking quarter of this year. he does not know i am dealing with dysphoria that eats me alive every morning, noon, and night, and makes me want to peel open my skin like a fucking banana, and has me on my knees, praying to every god there supposedly is, to please stop. has me wondering if any god is really up there, and if so why i am like this, making me wonder if i was hitler in my past life, and what i did to deserve this crawling skin that wi will never go to sleep at night. he does not know, and i wish he would stop pretending to know. i know he is sti will only a child he is my younger brother... he is ... he is too young to understand it all but i wish he would at least take a second of his ti ame to consider the pain i have been in, and or why i do not want to do all of these things he wants to do. i know his heart is in the right place, and that he just wants ti ame with his family, but right now this family is pretty close to falling apart. whether that is my fault or not, i would not know, because i am hiding in my room. someone, please tell me if i am losing my shits because i am too wilted to know anymore.	severe
depression after being rejected by a girl or is it something else? ok here it goes. i am and i have suffered from mild depression and anxiety before in high school i am also introverted, but anyways, i have never dated before and have only asked three girls out because it takes a while for me to build up relationships as an introvert and its tough finding people that i open up to and am attracted too. the first two ti ames i was rejected i did not really think anything of it. this last rejection it happened yesterday has hit me differently for some reason and i do not understand why. i have just felt alone all day, and more nervous and anxious and a little sick. i do not understand it. she did not reject me because she did not like me. she even said that i was one of the few people she felt understood her at the college we go too. she said no because she already had a boyfriend and that she sti will wanted to stay friends. one of the main reasons i did not want to ask her out was because i was worried we wouldn t be friends anymore but that is not an issue because she was worried that i wouldn t want to be friends, so i should feel fine, right? move on like i did the others. but i just can not for some reason. focusing on stuff is super difficult and i worry that i would not find anyone else to like, partially because its so hard for me to build meaningful relationships. what should i do? how do i go about feeling better? i want to move on and just be friends with her but i just do not get why i feel like i do. i am not obsessing over her i am just really upset and depressed for something small and its really frustrating.	severe
rebuilding your temple suffering from depression and taking on the monumental task of rebuilding yourself is one of the hardest things i have experienced. after a recent breakdown, i realized i have been totally neglecting my mental health for the sake of remaining comfortable. pulling yourself out of the mud is the opposite of comfortable, especially when the mud is all you have known for years and years. each day i try to make better than the last, but today has been hard for me. so i wanted to make this post in hopes of insti willing hope in someone else. seeing a temple, or skyscraper, whatever analogy you like, it inspires awe. but starting the process of construction seems so absolutely daunting. you may see another person is building going up faster than yours and get thiscouraged. they may be equipped with better tools. but their building is not your building. make a beautiful and happy home for you, and nobody else, because nobody else wi will inhabit it. take each brick and handle it with care. no matter how slow the process seems, your experience compounds on itself, and you wi will only get better and better at building, and eventually maintaining yourself. i hope your future is fi willed with progress and prosperity. whoever you are, wherever you come from, i love you and wish you happiness!	severe

how do you trust your therapist? it is always been hard for me to trust and for good reasons too. the problem i have with therapy is that your conversation is not confidential. they say it is but it is not. i can not talk about my suicidal thoughts or self harm otherwise they are forced to release my records and have me hospitalized. the government is allowed to ask for the records of my conversation if they wish too at any ti ame i know it might sound stupid to some of you but what if they do ask for it ?! i do not want them to know . am i just too fucked up for therapy ?! am i supposed to carry all my thoughts with me until i die or better yet ki will myself?	severe

some of us wi will not get better. some of us wi will not get better. some of us are too scared to ki will ourselves wi will suffer until the day we die unwi willingly. some of us wi will spend thousands of dollars and hours getting help to ulti amately wake up just as depressed as you were years ago. some of us wi will fight for years and lose to the noose. some of us wi will spend years fighting, finally achieve happiness, and then die suddenly. this world is cruel overwhelmingly so. ignorance truly is bliss. one can not be happy when constantly thinking of the negative. however, some live in the suffering and do not have the option to escape it as a thought because it is their reality. those who maintain a life of happiness are ignorant to their privilege and can not comprehend this suffering. when dealing with the pain, what are we given? a phone number. it wins grammy s, it solves everything... congrats humans, you did it. you solved depression with a phone number. if they ki will themselves, at least we tried! at least we tried. so fortunate are the happy to absolve themselves of responsibility. yet suicide is seen as the coward is way out. or selfish. or a shame . once you end your life, you are patronized by those surviving as somebody who had so much potential and should have gotten help . or maybe they wish we had talked about our problems . it is us and them. we are made to feel the way we do by them. we want to end our life to solve this problem. they do not accept this solution to our problem. weak as we are, we accept and search for other solutions. we turn to them for help. they do not want to. they help by murdering those sick in the streets. they help by dragging people out of their homes at gunpoint. they help by arresting people for being sick. they help by giving us a phone number. a fucking phone number. i have tried to ki will myself multiple ti ames. it did not work. i have asked for help. it did not work. i have gone to the hospitals and therapy. i took the medicine. i have spent over half of my life playing the role of guinea pig. i was when i first tried to ki will myself. i have never felt trust or love. their solutions do not help me, it only helps them absolve themselves of guilt when i do ki will myself. because they tried. and sure, plenty of us wi will get help, get meds, get friends, and feel stable. or at least make a positive i amprovement to manage their symptoms. plenty of us wi will make significan not i amprovements and try to help others. but some of us wi will not get better.	severe

i am going to die i, f, am going to die. i know i am. very soon. it hurts so much because of what i would leave behind. friendly coworkers, amazing boyfriend m, a great roommate, my only true friend who i met online. but it is just getting so hard to even open my eyes in the morning. the first thing on my mind is a cigarette, a drink, or some heroin. the next thing on my mind is the ptsd. then it is just a downward spiral into daylong madness and psychosis until i meet my lovely bed again and dream about my trauma. the fear of being raped again, being kidnapped, being left, being heartbroken, being beaten, overdosing. i love my boyfriend so much but it is getting so hard. the mornings i wake up and he is already at work are the hardest. i just want the memories and the temptations to stop. if my habits do not ki will me, i am afraid i eventually wi will. i know it is selfish, but i see no way any of this wi will end any ti ame soon, if not ever. venting helps temporarily, but what is the point when the bad thoughts always come back...	severe
life is messy this is a throwaway, as i know some friends know my main account i have been diagnosed with depression for almost all my life. or maybe the anxiety came first. it is hard to tell. i only have a few memories that came before my diagnoses. everything else is just a blur, as it is for most people. i was and sti will am always on medication. it would work, at first. i would have some semblance of normality. i would be si amilar to the others my age. but after a year or two, it would fall apart. the pi wills would have less and less of an effect. i would switch to a new medicine. the cycle repeated. anxiety and depression are almost like ying and yang for me. anxiety makes me over react. depression makes me under react. having both going at once feels like a virus. it is a program constantly running in the back of my head, sapping processing power and slowing me down. i know it is there. i know what it does. but i do not have the tools to remove it only lessen the effects. someti ames i feel guilty. i have a lot to be grateful for. i live in a safe place, with shelter, food, water, rights, and liberties. i have friends, few as they are, and family. i can do what i want to do, buy what i want to buy, go where i want to go. i can be who i want to be. it just does not feel like it. it is like something went wrong in my code. like a single, i amportant code was forgotten, and is unable to be fixed. only the emergency systems run the rest are in constant shutdown. i understand the science behind it. certain chemicals in the brain can be too high or too low. taking medication can fix that for a while. what i do not understand is why i can not overcome these issues, when i have full acknowledgement and understanding of what went wrong. if you have a broken leg, you need to give it ti ame to heal. you keep it wrapped, so it has a chance to heal correctly. then, you slowly work your way to a normal state. but what is normal, for someone with depression, or anxiety, or any range of mental i willness? what is normal, at its basis? if i have never had the chance to experience life without these problems, how can i work towards the basis of normality? i feel like something is missing. i am trying to find a piece to the puzzle, and no matter how hard i search or study or tear through my belongings, i can not find what it is. some part of me needs to be replaced or switched. i have no idea what. my mother recently told me that she attempted suicide when she was younger. i can not remember the exacts of it, only that she did not get caught and it did not work. else, i wouldn t be here. but therein lies a problem that i can not overcome. she knew that she had depression. she got her diagnosis, just as i did, so many years ago. she knew very well that it could be passed down, as it had in other family members. yet she sti will chose to give birth to me. all my life, i have asked many questions beginning with the si ample why . why am i like this? why would not anything work? why can not i change? but now, i truly have to ask why did she give birth to me? she knew the possibility it would pass down. she knew it could cripple someone, mentally. she knew the effects she experienced them, herself. she sti will went through with having me. i love my mother. she is given me more than i could ever i amagine. but i can not forgive her for doing this to me. and i do not think anything wi will change my mind. nothing wi will change my mind, just like nothing wi will ever change for the better.	severe

i got caught hanging myself two days ago i took a hangman is knot to my school in order to ki will myself. throughout the day people asked about it and i said that i was doing a photography project in order to spread awareness on depression and suicide. anyway, the classes finally ended and i went into a bathroom stall in order to hand myself. the stall had a window that led to a pathway with a lot of people. a guard saw me and notified iw integral wellness, an emotional support group from my school i eventually gave up on the idea of dying through hanging because it was too painful and managed to reach a wall and untie the knot. i walked to the exit and a guy from iw touched my shoulder and asked if we could go talk somewhere else. i knew what was up, so i decided to play along and go talk where he wanted to. he said that someone saw me hanging myself and notified them so they could have a chat with me. i can not express how enraged and irritated i felt when they started talking about it. i do not know how to explain it, it is as if i had just been caught doing something i was not supposed to do. they told me that they would have to notify my parents and come pick me up. my mom took more that hours to get there and all i heard was why would you do this to me?! you made us feel upset! . it seems that they are playing the victi ams now, what the fuck am i supposed to do now. there was a snitch in the family and now everyone i know knows about what i did. is there life after this? how do you cope with the possible rejection of the people around you? i can not feel a thing anyway, but i sti will do not want to bare with these people. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.	severe
hesitant to accept i am depressed again. i struggled with depression a significan notly age , the product of witnessing a murder at and being assaulted at , i ended up even having to retake a school year. i tried a few medications, prozac launched me into psychosis and hospitalised me and remeron made me angry and otherwise dead behind the eyes. i had therapy that entire ti ame and eventually with the help of two excellent therapists, worked my life out. i finished school, got a place at university and moved to the city i always dreamed of living in. i met a boy and fell in love and gained some real confidence. but the city i moved to was not everything i hoped it would be and my relationship is not either and my confidence is godawful and practically nonexistent now despite the loving words my boyfriend uses. and i have slowly sunk into a depression again despite doing what i could to fight it i even went on a surf trip to africa, trying to reset my confidence and my self worth and remind myself how beautiful and exciting life can be blah blah but i was significan notly depressed there too . and now i sit here, with a life that from the outside seems pretty fine, but internally i hate myself and want to die. i have found myself thinking about suicide as a sort of back up plan again which is something i used to do. but the idea of going back to therapy, maybe taking antidepressants again, the idea that i am sick again after everything i did to get better, makes me want to explode. i do not want to confront it. i do not know what to do.	severe
am i attention seeking? i have been really in the dumps lately. it is weird. life is starting to get better for me. i am a year old ftm basically, i am a dude . i start testosterone in may, and the other day i got my first binder. my family is accepting and supporting. my friends are too. and yet, i sti will always feel depressed and suicidal. every day i am in constant doubt of my self worth. i never feel like i am significan not. things would be better if i had not existed. is this all out of attention? is it believable that i only behave this way because i want the attention? i have been on sertraline since january i have depression and anxiety . i take mg a day. i have not taken my meds in a week though, for my parents have not called in our local pharmacy for a refi will. is my dose a side effect of these feelings? should i bring this up with my counsellor and psychologist? so much is going through my head... i just do not want to come off as if this is out of attention. i hate being perceived that way.	severe
i am crying for the first ti ame in year i keep faking a smile trying too look like i want to live people only help when you admit to being suicidal, but then they dont really want to help, i am not even sure if they can. they just send you to a doctor with a month line, just to be set on medications. my father only cared when the school warned hi am, suddenly he cared, not when he beat me, not when he locked me crying into a room for hi am to spend ti ame with drunk girls. forces me to take vitamins and stare into bright sun lamps just to make hi am feel better for making me feel better not to mention my mother that schizophrenic several suicide attempts to save me from aliens in newspapers shit. breaking the household apart with fighting. i can not stand my life in this madness, i dont know if i should laugh or cry, i cried so much i stopped completely, all i can do is laugh. i am left constantly emotionless. auti am on top of that only makes it worse. suicidal for years i am stuck in this hell in my body unable to commit suicide the medicine does not fix anything it just slaps a smile on your face while the world is the same i try not to get into relationships, i can not subject someone to my insanity. i can not go a day without hating everyone and wanting to die. but i can put on a smile for a while and that works i can not scream i want to stay anonymous. alot is in the past there is more and worse but its not in the text this text is bad. sorry i hate everything and i just want it to end	severe

hey about a year ago i was diagnosed with depression, and anxiety. around this ti ame was when i had attempted suicide and family started worrying about me, generally everything was going to shit. ever sense then its been a rapid decline. no one knows though, as far as everyone irl knows, i am fine. i just want someone to know that i am not fine, i am the opposite, and ive come to terms with it. about a year ago when this originally happened, i let this out with thoughts in my head. now i typically let it out with reddit posts. this all started with the thought, i wonder how people would react if i were gone. then the first person i told about it was my girlfriend when this happened. this is my biggest fuck up. i got myself so attached to her and then when she broke up with me, i could not handle it. she did it because i was too stressful. i was letting out all of my emotions at her. but she could not take it, and i ruined everything. its not her fault. i screwed up the relationship. after an entire year i sti will can not get over this. i hate myself for it. i should just ki will myself, it would make everything so much better for everyone, including myself. i am not going to though, why? because i am scared of it.	severe
finding a therapist is like trying on shoes when your ankles are broken it hurts to find one, open up to them and when i realize that one is not the right one for me then i hurt even more and get thiscouraged to go through that process again....i am having second therapy session with this new therapist and i am nervous and hopeful.	severe
i hope antidepressants wi will ki will me i am going to be taking antidepressants probably next week. i hope they wi will make me even more suicidal so i can finally end it. i am planning to overdose on those antidepressants if i do get to that point.	severe
antidepressants not working? so, i am not really one to post on reddit much, but i am beginning to feel hopeless and i am not sure what to do from here. i have been on a handful of medications since i was thirteen. i am twenty now. i do not remember whether i took my previous medications consistently or not, but i recall either zoloft or prozac making me numb and having to stop the medications. wellburtrin, the previous medication before the one i am on currently worked for me, but only for a week and a half. it was great while it lasted, but i ulti amately figured it was because it took me a long ti ame to take wellburtrin consistently, and now that i had, my body had gotten used to it. i have been taking my current medicaton, lexapro consistently and noticed that i was beginning to feel happier. then, again, just like wellburtrin, i noticed my depression beginning to seep through, having moments where i wi will get depressed, then happy and excited for life, then having a huge mental breakdown and realizing my medication was no longer working for me. lexapro worked for me for.. i want to say a good week and a half, and i have only been on it for two months at this point. i understand if medication stops working after a long ti ame, but the past two medications i have taken and that have worked stopped after a week and a half of happiness. i feel hopeless and like any medication i take would not work for me, and like there is no point in even continuing to try. is this normal? i have talked to my psychiatrist about electro convulsive therapy, but she did not have any information on it. please, help. i am not sure how much longer of this i can take.	severe
i am going emotionally numb. my depression and anxiety has been hitting me particularly hard recently. i do not want to go too much into it, but it has not been this bad since my friend died last year. i am always exhausted and lack motivation for anything. at this rate i am going to fail all my classes, which is making my anxiety and depression worse. but i can not do anything about it. i do not have the energy to get out of bed in the morning. my boyfriend and i just broke up yesterday. it was mutual. i am trying to deal with this and he is trying to get into a good college. so we both decided it was over. everything is happening at once and i am going numb. i want to cry but i can not. i feel too numb. i know i have people to talk to but i do not want to. all i want to do is isolate myself fro everyone. i do not feel anything and it is scaring me. i feel everything so deeply, and that is what always gets me hurt. i have been told this more ti ames than i can count. but for the first ti ame ever, i do not feel anything. i have thought about cutting again but i can not even get out of my bed to get my razor. i feel like even if i did i wouldn t get the same adrenaline rush i am used to. i am going so numb and i am scared i am going to lose everything. i do not know what to do. i am so lost.	severe
good experience with antidepressant so i was on half a pi will of wellbutrin for a week to make sure there is no negative side effects and today was my first day on the whole pi will mg. i actually feel happy and i feel like myself again... i have the same happy feeling i had when i was a young child. i even cried because i felt so overwhelmed with happiness and motivation and i have been missing out on this the whole ti ame .... anyone else ?	severe
some psychiatrists are really... weird warning this post deals with social issues and can be potentially triggering. this happened a few months ago in october, when i had to be hospitalised for suicidal ideation it was voluntary and only for a couple of days . the first thing i had to do was talk to the psychiatrist doctor and explain my situation. i went over the obvious reasons for my depression being isolated, being left out, no self esteem. then he asks me about friends. i explain i have a couple people i consider friends but i rarely talk to them, let alone hang out with them. he wonders why that is. i say i do not like to open up to people and am afraid of being hurt. then he asks if i have a girlfriend i am and i say no. he asks if i have had one in the past, i say no again. then , and this is the weird part, he asks me why . i am pretty much stunned at this point. why does that seem odd to hi am? am i really that much of a fuck up? is it not normal to not have had a girlfriend at the age of ? i take a moment to process this and just blurt out i do not really know? he goes on, asking if i am not interested in relationships. of course i am fucking interested. does he not realise that the other person has to be interested too? can he really not see that i am not someone people are interested in? i can not just go up to a girl and say hey, you re my girlfriend now. love you. apparently he thinks it is weird that i have never had a girlfriend. well thanks, do not i feel good about myself. he literally said that is odd. all i can think to answer is okay? then he tells me i should hang out with people more. that i should go on walks with girl friends. well, i would love to, but you see, other people do not want to do that. and who am i supposed to befriend? i do not go to school and am unemployed. i do not have any contact outside my i ammediate family. i can not just message someone i barely know and start talking. that is honestly creepy. i leave that day feeling worse than ever, after having already felt worse than ever . thank you eastern european psychiatrist, very cool.	severe
my therapist and getting used to them this is my first experience with doing cognitive behavioral therapy and i just wanted to know how other people is have gone? i am not sure if this guy is a good fit for me. he tries to be laid back by using curse words.. he yawns a lot. i kinda find it odd too that while i am talking, he is not looking at me, but instead at his computer screen and clicking a lot. i thought it was my chart maybe, but there is a large picture frame on the wall behind hi am where i can see a reflection and it looks like he is just browsing articles. whenever i am done talking.. he is typically quiet.. so my natural response is to keep talking, but i do this to try to save the unnatural quietness in the room. it is strange.. anyone else?? does your therapist kind just exist there while you talk yourself through your own problems? and he is just there to shake my hand at the end? hmmmmm not sure what to do.	severe
coming up on my one year anniversary i was committed a year ago because i had a detailed plan. have had major depressive thisorder all my life, but it got progressively worse after i was dragged back to work in a job i hated two weeks after major surgery, and weeks before my surgeon wanted me to. that is a pain and a weakness i wouldn t wish on anyone. i was in a wheelchair for two weeks so i could sti will do my job, but i would feel my muscles tremble from sitting upright after only minutes. husband who can be the world is biggest jerk, and i refuse to defend hi am in this instance declared i wish you d just ki will yourself when you say you want to during an argument that only he wanted to have he did not think i should have lunch so he would have more ti ame to play cards, where his parents were going to feed hi am. he really sounds like a major abuser, and he was and can sti will be . i kicked hi am out that day, and was going to go to work, then come home and take a hot bath. i figured it was the largest chunk of ti ame before i would be missed. luckily, i had a counselor who knew something was horrifically wrong. after prodding, i spi willed it all. she helped me get admitted to the hospital and stayed with me until a family member could come take me. i was scared sick, because my mom always stigmatized being committed because it would end your teaching career forever. can not have that, can we. while i was in the hospital, it all stopped, and it was insane for me. i knew i hated teaching, and i hated my job. i hated it all so much. i hated that i was constantly called to put my job and my husband is bank account ahead of my own sense of fulfi willment. visiting hours were great, by the way. my mom and sister knew what my husband had said to me, and no one was their usual warm selves to hi am. in therapy sessions, i talked out what would happen if i abandoned my teaching career. it occurred to me that i sti will have the people ski wills, the problem solving, connections, etc, etc. when my certification expires... i do not have to renew it. the idea of a traditional classroom fi willed me with so much dread... i told my family, and the same day i was released, i went to my boss who i loved, it was my big boss that demanded i return to work. she is loved by no one . i did not bother with changing anything about my clothes, except to put on certain clothing items they confiscated. and i informed her i would be quitting at the end of the school year. period. two months into my unemployment, while we were in japan long story, do not ask i was thinking about what my therapist had once asked me what would you do you if you knew you could not fail? well, i had wanted to be a veterinarian when i was a kid up until i was ...and then my depression told me it would never happen. i was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. i talked to vets, i read every single book i could find, it was my thing. i was that kid that people would bring their ani amals to look at, and i could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they would be mentally prepared for the bi will. vet school was out, but i had researched veterinary tech programs while i was a teacher the problem was that they were all full ti ame programs during the day. but hey, that was no longer a problem! i burst into tears when i realized that i had figured out why i needed to stay i had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me i had to. i applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in tokyo bay. husband, who did not know me back when i was weird ani amal girl, thought this was i ampulsive and out of nowhere. it was not until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it was not i ampulse. mom said oh, thank god, that is what i have been waiting to hear for years. she told my grandpa and his response was it is about damn ti ame!! he had to realized that oh, no. this was a huge part of my personality he had not noticed i started classes three weeks later. every day, i am jazzed to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing i have always wanted. for the first ti ame since i went into teaching, way back in , i feel hope. i sti will struggle with depression, obviously, especially because i have lapsed on therapy fricking copays ...but i maybe found the thing that wi will keep me going. being admitted really did end my teaching career forever.	severe
complete apathy? uh is this normal? i have been depressed for a long ti ame, probably since i was a young kid, but i have always been pretty emotional. but over the last year i have noticed a change, and it is not for the better. for example last year my girlfriend broke up with me on valentine is and i did not feel anything. not relief, not sadness, nothing. absolutely nothing. i continued on my day like nothing happened. this goes for everything now, someone says they do not like me? i feel nothing. someone says shit behind my back? nothing. hear sad news? nothing. i feel like a fucking alien and it scares me. is this normal? am i a developing sociopath? what the fuck do i do?	severe

any advice for not crying in i amportant meeting? dear reddit yr old woman, on my th therapist all for about yea each , depression, extremely low self esteem, anxiety, effexor mg for years. i have no emotional armour . if i make a mistake or i recieve harsh words from someone, or if i even think someone doesnt like me i am a fire hose of tears. no friends, no relationships i work at a factory, and on saturday our team of was reduced to when a young man had to go home because he was i will. that meant i had to take two jobs nobody could come in . we worked slower and i thought i had everything under control, but turns out i didnt and error report was written by the next shift. that means i have a meeting on wednesday where me and some bosses wi will go trough why it happened and how it can be avoided in the future. what i know i wi will not lose my job. this has happened many ti ames before, i have even written two such error reports myself about the very same thing. i miiiight get a warning. i dont think so. my boss called me a major resource for the department on our previous personell meeting. what i also know there may be stern words that we should have worked slower to catch up which we did people wi will look very serious it wi will all feel like its my fault, like i am hopeless. i wi will feel my face go red and tears start running i may or may not succeed at my usual method of pretending i get coffee down the wrong pipe and cough, excuse myself and cry in the bathroom. but when i do, the redness wi will not go away for like minutes. my next therapist session is next week, so she can not help. except she couldnt help anyway, because all she does is ask me the same questions i have been answering for years. she talks about how she is going to give me tools to handle this, but so far there have been no tools. do you have one?	severe
what else can i do? i asked for help the moment i felt myself feel depressed and weird. i went to therapy. it is been months and no i amprovement has happened. i went to see a psychiatrist months ago. i have tried two antidepressants and they have made me feel even more depressed. they usually work for a week then the feeling returns with vengeance. i do not want to go up my dose if it would not work. tapering wi will be a bitch i tried socializing but i feel so weird, shallow, hollow, emotional less, dramatic, stupid, beautiful, boring, and pathetic all at once. i am on lamictal and zoloft but nothing is changed much. i have no friends. i am a freshman who eats, studies, and travels completely alone. it is painful seeing others happy when you re completely miserable. i am jealous and sad. i wish i felt somewhat stable. i tried changing my diet, exercising, and nothing is worked. i am a burden and i wasted money and ti ame. i feel exhausted knowing i tried hard to not get worse, only for me to feel worse than i have ever had before. i was in bed feeling awful all day today. i do not see a point in anything. what more can i do when i have done every single thing to feel better? i am lost. i just want to be at peace.	severe
getting depressed again? so i am f and i have taken antidepressants the last ti ame years ago. i have had ups and downs when i got off and with i was having a rough ti ame for two months started drinking and smoking weed a lot. kinda managed to get back on track then and have not been feeling too bad until now. lately i have been feeling kinda blue and started making mistakes or have to go through stuff multiple ti ames to do it correctly or to be able to remember it. currently i am having a week off and have to go back to work on monday. i just do not know i feel like i am getting worse and want to sleep most of the ti ame and at first i thought it is because i am used to working a lot, but when i think about having to go back soon i feel like throwing up and at the same ti ame doing nothing also does not sit well with me. i guess i am kinda scared at the moment because i do not want to feel like i was feeling years ago and i sti will do not feel comfortable with my own mind and do not trust myself that i am strong enough to pull through if depression hits me again.	severe
every day it gets harder to say no . i am plagued by intrusive thoughts telling me to hurt or ki will myself. it is so exhausting day in and day out having to confront that choice in my head. it could be over something major or minor, but i wi will obsess over past present and future and weigh the likelihood of things getting better vs finally taking the last step. it is day in and day out, and i can not seem to escape the constant reminder of an easy way to stop the pain. there are reasons i can not go through with it, but the reasons make it worse. i chose to leave and get medical help, but all that got me was facing homelessness again and losing my children. i am sick, i have therapy, i have antidepressants, but i am not getting better. the mental anguish is getting worse. i can not stop obsessing over my children growing up without me, it hurts so much more than i can adequately express. i am constantly screaming internally and i have no outlet. yes i have family but they do not understand. i can not open up to them. all i get is either annoying opti amism or meaningless platitudes. how can i ease the burden on my mind when the gut wrenching depression is all i know? i feel lost and adrift in this bleak ocean and i do not know how much longer i can keep my head above water. i am , i have nothing to show for it but a life of regrets. the only things to bring legiti amate joy was my kids, and now that they are gone, what left is there for me? i can not handle losing that connection i had with them, and i feel it slipping. i just can not shake the feeling that things wi will never get better. i am drowning and there is nothing around for me to hold on to. it scares me and leads to mental anguish, which feeds back into the self hate and suicidal thoughts. which scares me and and repeats the process. it is easy to say no when you have things worth living for, it is harder when those things are so far away you re effectively alone.	severe
i keep daydreaming and having fantasies to pass the ti ame i did not realised at first. i think this is a long process with ups and downs. i am and i think i have been depressed since i am . i have been having fantasies to escape reality. i do not do it on purpose, i can not help it. it is just that it is better than real life, it is less boring . i daydream while i was on high school, or when i was on uni or now at work. even when i am by myself at home reading things on the internet, or if i visit family or hang out with friends, things wi will often get boring and i wi will escape reality. i i amagine how my life would be if i was able to get tons of chics, or if i was rich, or if i had some kind of superpower of ability, or if i lived in a fantastic world, or if could ti ame travel at wi will to correct my mistakes, or to experience several ti amelines, or to si amply get rich by betting like marty mcfly . i am realising that the fantasies are getting more detailed and sophisticated. my latest one is that i i amagine myself having some kind of little calendar book or pocket diary. for observers the book wi will look ordinary, and they would not see anything weird, but for me, i wi will see text and pictures appearing on its pages. the book wi will tell me anything i need to know do not book that flight, it wi will crash , or call sick that day, because it is going to be a bad day at work , or do not forget about that thing , or next ti ame you have a debate about this topic, you can refute them with this argument , or these are the football matches results for next week, and this is how much people are going to bet . also for satisfying my curiosity what was the population in ad? like the exact one, not esti amates , or what is the voynich manuscript about and what does it say? , or did jesus really existed, and where and when? , etc, etc. this wi will help my anxiety because it would prevent me from taking risks, it would make rich of course and it would satisfy my curiosity. i wi will be reading in my book calmly and others would think i am just checking my calendar. anyway, this kind of supernatural things wi will never happen. i know that. but i keep fantasising anyway, one of my hopes is that with the progress in virtual reality, i could experience these things to some extent some day. someti ames i am opti amistic when i see all the progress in technology and how the economy grows we produce more, salaries are higher, etc . but when i see how shitty politics and society is, i get pessi amistic. p.s. english is not my native language, sorry for any errors.	severe
why can not i commit suicide? i can not do things anymore i have been living with it for years of constant suicidal ideation and failed attempts as of tonight. i had the pi wills in my hand, took half of them and ended up throwing them back up before i could get the rest down. i hate living and it is too painful to keep trying and falling back worse. i have been through intensive therapy, been admitted and sectioned before none of it has helped, nothing releases my pain or anger i just end up making it worse. but my body is physically rejecting my attempts against my wi will if i cut myself, my arm jerks and i end up with minor cuts it i take pi wills i those them up. how do i get around the fact that my own body want me to be in pain?	severe
what to do these days? i have struggled with depression and anxiety for all my life now and every ti ame i would feel alone or down there was always something i could do. usually when i would want to feel better i would go to a cafe and read or just chi will to calm down or go look for cool things in stores . i could even go to the swi amming pool or gym. now that is all taken away from me. the only thing left for me to do is go shopping at grocery stores and all that adds is stress these days. my dog recently died and now i can not enjoy a single thing and my anxiety seems like it is going to make my head explode. even my camping plans for most of summer are gone because i can not camp with a tent i need a camper. so i guess what i am asking is, has anyone found new ways to cope with their negative feelings? i need to find a way to bring myself back from this episode i am having.	severe

i have been struggling for a while now i have been depressed since i have been years old i am now m. never in my life have i ever struggled with suicidal thoughts or feelings until now. i am afraid to tell people how i feel, i do not want to stress out my family, friends, and girlfriend. i feel alone and the one person i want to talk to ignores me and that makes my feelings amplified. i feel like i have nothing and that my life is just a waste. i have been told by people i rely on others too much for my happiness. i just do not know what to do anymore. i feel so alone	severe
really need to vent posting thins is therapeutic and i need to get this out right now before i explode any further. i am absolutely thisappointed with myself and i do not understand why the fuck i even exist. i am average at best in everything i try to strive for. life was not always good for my family but i never felt like i hit this level before. since college, i have slowly hit a depressing spiral that has only accelerated and gotten worse over ti ame. before i even started my first semester, i lost my dad, which just shook my whole world beyond belief and ever since i feel like i just can not win at anything. i am even fully aware of some accomplishments that i probably should be proud of but i can not even acknowledge them, they just feel undeserved. i am undeserving. i get so overly attached to people emotionally that when they inevitably leave i can not recover. i constantly deal with this brain fog and loss of motivation to the point that i feel inadequate in every aspect of my life and find no joy from passions. i just have to phone in the emotions i believe i am supposed to have during any moment. i have fought through suicidal thoughts and then some. now i am to the point where any minor inconvenience tips my scales easily and if it gets too bad i cut my arms with scissors. y all i am so tired. i do not want to ki will myself, i admit suicide scares me so much. but i also do not want to do this anymore. all the painful memories, the mistakes, all of it is too much. i keep trying to push through but i just do not want to anymore. my old self is just gone and what emerged is someone no one should bother wasting ti ame or energy on in any shape or form.	severe
are not we all just tired? i have been depressed for months. i lost trust with people irl. i now lost trust with people online whom i had established relationships. i do not know who i am anymore. i act differently than what i thought i should be? i used to be sociable where i put on a mask of fake smile because it is socially acceptable. it is what people expect from me. i thought it was never me as despite the mask, i am sad, miserable, depressed and buli amic from the inside. i got hit by a bad depression relapse last august and things went sour. i stopped wearing the friendly mask irl and hid myself online. i became thistant with people. i only talk with persons irl out of tens to hundreds of people that i know in person. and this is in the premise that these persons sent me tens of messages and gave me several missed calls before i respond back after days. i am very thistant that i only have a poker face on from the outside. i do started wearing that happy mask online. on reddit. but it never gave me my sense of self. i trusted people who ended up breaking me. i do not know who to trust anymore. i do not think i can be fixed. i am broken. i want to have a restart on life. i want to be a different person. i want to be someone who does not just spout my problems to others and caused them annoyance for me. i want to go back to the me before where i can fake being sociable and friendly. i want to just put up a fake smile and pretend to care when i do not. i am tired of feeling emotions. i want my brain to stop. i want it to not function anymore. i just want people who would not give up on me when i am giving up on myself.	severe
need help coping i had my life pretty much figured out and together. i got selected by a good uni for masters and i was supposed to travel abroad. i have been going for therapy on and off since i was . but now i have hit a wall. my life seems like a mess, i am living with my parents and i absolutely hate them. recently i started remembering i have been sexually abused when i was and i told my parents about it, they had a very weird reaction. my mom literally said that she was too and why is it a big deal. you have to move on and deal with it. my mom has depression, i have seen her diary about suicide and literally dealt with her mood swings and silent crying periods for years. now i feel i m headed down the same path. i literally treat my bf like my mom treats my dad. it is all going extremely downhi will and i can not seem to even get out of bed. every day something that helps me think is literally hanging myself and that gives me this weird odd joy. i would never really do it but i can not stop thinking of it. or jumping down. other than that i have these small meltdowns where i literally need the smallest trigger ie news, small thisagreements, etc that make me scream into my pi willow and hit the wall with it. i feel extremely irritated, angry, and frustrated. end of the day, i can not even go back to therapy soon because of the lockdown and i can not do it at home because i am scared my parents wi will overhear. i just want a way out of this house and this horrible situation. i want to be able to feel something other than deep sadness that comes after my meltdowns.	severe
