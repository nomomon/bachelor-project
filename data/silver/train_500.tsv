train_pid_1	Waiting for my mind to have a breakdown once the “New Year” feeling isn’t there anymore : I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m a little bit worried that I’ll go back to being depressed in a few days time or something. Last year, I tried not to have any breakdowns for the start of 2019. A mere 10 days later, I broke down crying. I wasn’t the same for that entire year. Up until December, where I was ok that month. Now I just wait... it’s a weird way to act and feel, but it feels a bit normal.	moderate

train_pid_4	"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine."	moderate

train_pid_6	"I will probably end it when my mum isn't around anymore. : I can say with certainty that I have tried hard to make my life one worth living but my ongoing depression is more present and crippling than ever recently.

I would never do anything while my mum is still alive because I know she wouldn't cope. I'm her only daughter and we are very close. But I'm clueless as to how to live with this fog that has followed me since my teenage years, especially if I don't have her in my life.

It's as if the depression becomes heavier the older I get, despite the sertraline and hours and hours of therapy. I just can't see myself living a long and fulfilled life."	moderate
train_pid_7	Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.	moderate

train_pid_9	Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.	moderate
train_pid_10	"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent..."	moderate

It’s gonna be a new year and I’m sure it’ll be just as worthless as this year. So I decided to down like half the bottle. It’s a small one, but I never drink, so a few minutes later I was feeling dizzy and still I am. I don’t even care. I would probably down the whole bottle if it wouldn’t make my dad suspicious.

I can't take going to school, not talking to anyone then coming back home, unmotivated to do anything, just watching pointless videos and daydreaming about stuff that's never going to happen. 

I miss the times when I told people that I had no friends, but I actually had people who cared about me. Now what I once said is actual reality. I miss being able to share my thoughts with someone. It somehow gave me the drive to battle the things life threw at me.

This is the first new year I spent completely alone because I am home sick. I could have gone to a friend who was partying with a lot of strangers(to me), but without alcohol I can't even tolerate that for 30 minutes.
So I am sitting at home, alone and I just feel empty again, like so often. It's like this physical black hole in my chest that sucks in all my energy. I have this very often, especially when I am not distracted by anything. 
In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.
How are you guys dealing with that, because it's gnawing away at me."	moderate

train_pid_25	“The best years of your life” : Cant shake the feeling that this new year signifies another year failing at school, working a shitty job that I hate to pay for it, having no friends and living at home with very indifferent parents. These are my 20s, the “best years of my life” and I’ve been closer now to killing myself this past tear than ever before. Earlier tonight I wished for the courage to kill myself before 2020 was over. If I were to tell this to anyone they would probably just tell me to “look on the bright side” and “make your life what you want it to be”, both phrases are completely unhelpful and seem to shift the blame on me for being unhappy.

train_pid_26	How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??	moderate

I don't think I would have done anything, but I was so scared I couldn't be alone with myself.

Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, "" where are you it's after 8!""

train_pid_32	"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months.

Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.	moderate

train_pid_43	Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment.

train_pid_44	"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent..."	moderate

So I am sitting at home, alone and I just feel empty again, like so often. It's like this physical black hole in my chest that sucks in all my energy. I have this very often, especially when I am not distracted by anything. 
In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.

train_pid_63	How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??	moderate

train_pid_69	"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months.

train_pid_76	Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading	moderate

But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now. I guess I just have to go through these two weeks.

train_pid_86	I need therapy but I'm too scared to ask for it. : I want to tell my parents I need therapy and how depressed I am, but they'd just say I have it better than so many people and that I'm lazy; that's the response I get any time I mention something about my mental health. Also, if I tell my school, they'd notify my parents and it would be an absolute shitstorm if they found out that I didn't tell them first. I'm so hopeless and I don't know what to do at this point. What should I do?	moderate
train_pid_87	"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent."	moderate

train_pid_90	Another shitty new year. : I think it's fair to say that the past few years (since 2014 or so) each year got gradually worse and worse. Now here we are. 2020. I'm at an all-time high of depression, loneliness, and other issues I won't bore you with. Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore. Let's all hope that 2020 brings on new opportunities and new positivity into all our lives. I invite anybody to take a shot with me as the clock strikes midnight. We may not be celebrating together in person, but that shot will bring us all together for that split moment. Cheers, and happy New Year everybody.	moderate
train_pid_91	Why do you and, people I love pick people who treat us like nothing. : (We accept the love we think we deserve) You know when you’re with someone and things are just not right but, you’re afraid to ask because the answer might be worse then the feeling right now. I think I’m the only person who has destined to care so much about one person it nearly kills me. How do people go on when they lose someone they love so much? I don’t understand how people wake up and keep moving on. But you do wake up and for just a sec you forget then, ohh you remember...

I’ve had absolutely no one to be able to talk to about my emotions and feelings and have honestly just been stuck with all of my thoughts. My parents have been so emotionally and verbally mean to me that I’m just to scared to open up to them. My friends think of me as this dumbass funny guy when in reality, I’m actually sad. I just act like that because sit helps me get away from my feelings and how I’m
feeling. My girlfriend moved to Florida and she was honestly the only thing that made me happy and actually cherish life. But now... I’m just depressed and fucking wish I wasn’t here. I’m just stressed about school and I don’t have anyone to just go to and hug when I need to, I never have and I doubt I ever will. No one has been there for me physically and I feel so empty and alone. I honestly and am ready to just start the new decade in a spiritual way."	moderate

train_pid_95	"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us"	moderate
train_pid_96	"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day.

train_pid_115	"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine."	moderate

I’m not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we’re currently in and spent the night outside (we’re on a ski vacation, it get’s below -15°C here at night).

Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.	moderate

train_pid_120	Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.	moderate
train_pid_121	"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent..."	moderate

train_pid_139	How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??	moderate

train_pid_145	"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months.

train_pid_152	Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly.

My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

train_pid_168	Why do you and, people I love pick people who treat us like nothing. : (We accept the love we think we deserve) You know when you’re with someone and things are just not right but, you’re afraid to ask because the answer might be worse then the feeling right now. I think I’m the only person who has destined to care so much about one person it nearly kills me. How do people go on when they lose someone they love so much? I don’t understand how people wake up and keep moving on. But you do wake up and for just a sec you forget then, ohh you remember...

train_pid_172	"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us"	moderate
train_pid_173	"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

What's the point if I'm just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? I'm finally serious about going to college, but the only way I can afford it is if I abuse the shit out of myself. I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.)

Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it’s been very hard trying to get him a job (he’s 24 and it’s all he asks about). He’s even been asking me if he can live with me when i’m older and ready to move out of my moms house. It’s all just too much and i don’t even know where my heads at.

I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll talk to the doctor about it and they’ll deny me getting antidepressants and that therapy won’t help.

I’m pretty sure she’s into the other guy now who happens to be one of her exes. It’s just been making me sad because when I like a girl I really really like her and it’s hard for me to stop. that’s why when they don’t like me bad I have a hard time coping with the fact that they don’t like me back. this girl I like is special in many ways I could honestly go on forever and describe how perfect she is. that’s why it’s hard knowing she doesn’t like me. she’s going to a New Years party in my hometown with the guy she likes and I’m not sure what’s gonna happen, it’s just been irritating me very much, I have no one to talk to. I’m in a huge hotel with my family and they’re all drunk, my friends are either busy or at parties, I’ve come to this chat to talk, I feel kinda pathetic for some reason. anyways, that’s how I’m going to end my decade. feeling depressed about a girl that’s in a different province than me. very pathetic. hopefully someone that’s either dumb enough to want to listen to my story or is just curious to read this or for some reason ends up reading all of this, hopefully they can say something back, I just want to hear something from someone that isn’t my own conscious. now I’m just getting vibes that I want to badly die, I know I’m not suicidal but I just want life to stop for a very long time so I can have a break from everything. that’s about all I had to say, it’s New Years in 2 minutes. again hopefully someone sees this. happy New Years to everyone that sees this and everyone in general I guess. goodnight	moderate

But after 16 everything changed. Nothing traumatizing happened but I noticed I no longer genuinely laughed and I always found excuses to be alone. Over the years I thought I became a master of putting on a mask and making it seem like life was ok. 

But over the last 4 years I am left alone. My wife who I still love left me, I dont talk to my parents or siblings, and I have no friends who I talk to outside of work. This shit sucks and I really hope anyone who can see themselves falling into depression gets help right away. I wish I did. Really people get fucking help, dont lose family and friends over this disease because if you go on with it too long it gets so much harder to get out of.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense."	moderate

train_pid_239	"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine."	moderate

train_pid_241	Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.	moderate

I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset.

train_pid_244	"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try...

In between the empty feeling turns into a wave of sadness and anger over being alone and nothing really mattering, before I just go empty again...It's exhausting, but I can't sleep...it keeps me awake. 2020 is already starting out to be great.

train_pid_260	“The best years of your life” : Cant shake the feeling that this new year signifies another year failing at school, working a shitty job that I hate to pay for it, having no friends and living at home with very indifferent parents. These are my 20s, the “best years of my life” and I’ve been closer now to killing myself this past tear than ever before. Earlier tonight I wished for the courage to kill myself before 2020 was over. If I were to tell this to anyone they would probably just tell me to “look on the bright side” and “make your life what you want it to be”, both phrases are completely unhelpful and seem to shift the blame on me for being unhappy. I just want to know how y’all plan to survive 2020? Honestly getting pretty used to the idea of riding out in a hearse  before 2021.	moderate
train_pid_261	How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??	moderate

I'm really nervous about seeing therapy and don't know where to start. : Christmas Eve/morning I laid awake trying to find a reason to be alive. I couldn't find a single reason and was incredibly scared. In that moment I decided I didn't want to be alive. So I went and had a cup of coffee at a Waffle House so that I wasn't alone. I don't think I would have done anything, but I was so scared I couldn't be alone with myself.

I've talked to some friends about it and calmed down, but I think I finally need to stop putting off seeking help for my depression. I don't want to be in that place again.

train_pid_267	"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. 
Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again. During all of these I had to leave university for the year as I couldn't deal with the pression at the time. The thing is I study Industrial Engineer and I'm working as a Marketing E   Commerce Analyst for Dell.com.br.

train_pid_274	Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading	moderate

But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now. I guess I just have to go through these two weeks.

train_pid_285	"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent."	moderate

Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore.

train_pid_293	"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

train_pid_298	"I wasted an entire decade. : Back in 2010, I thought by now I would have my shit together. A career, a degree, true love, *something.* Instead, I'm in the same place I was back then, except my youth is officially over. I'm turning 30 this year. Everyone my age is settling down and staying inside. Soon, my body will give out on me too. I used to be a fat kid, but I've gotten a lot more active in the past couple years. What's the point if I'm just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? I'm finally serious about going to college, but the only way I can afford it is if I abuse the shit out of myself. I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.) Even my personal taste is becoming ""old people."" According to posts from r/starterpacks and elsewhere, things I like such as indie music, craft beer and tattoos are apparently ""insufferable pretentious yuppie boomer millennial shit"" now. I feel like I'm becoming Grandpa Simpson: ""I used to be with 'it', but then they changed what 'it' was. Now what I'm with isn't 'it' anymore and what’s 'it' seems weird and scary.

train_pid_299	Getting back to normal life : I've been getting treatment for a couple months now and finally feel like my life is back on track with a successful medication regamine and therapy. However I kinda fell off the face of the planet while things were going wrong and feel that ive lost a lot of friends because of it. I do feel bad for being generally unavailable or a bit flaky, but it's hard to think about the fact that I've sort of lost my old life before I got sick.

But now it’s the last two hours of the year and my parents are watching something else, my brother is playing video games and I’m stuck in the basement feeling sorry for myself.  

The last hours and I’m depressed. I’m going to start the new year depressed. Sometimes I hate that I have hope... it somehow hurts me more

Once it’s 12:00 I’m gonna go to bed, listen to music while staring up at the ceiling just letting depression take over, like usual."	moderate
train_pid_301	Changed my life for the better, still miserable : This year, not only did I finally get my ged, after wasting 5 years of my life doing nothing, I lost weight, got myself my first job, put my self out there, started socializing more, had sex, and some how i still feel utterly alone, tierd, depressed and all around miserable.

train_pid_310	Am I depressed or is this just a rough patch(vent) : This is probably going to sound stupid but I don’t know if I should seek help because of how i’ve been feeling lately or if this is just a rough time and it’ll get better over time. Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it’s been very hard trying to get him a job (he’s 24 and it’s all he asks about). He’s even been asking me if he can live with me when i’m older and ready to move out of my moms house. It’s all just too much and i don’t even know where my heads at. I didn’t mean to make this post THAT long but I just don’t know what I should do. Should I seek help? Or will everything get better over time ....	moderate
train_pid_311	"Jeez, looking back at the decade is horribly depressed. From 15 to 25, almost NOTHING changed for the good. : I believe I dropped out of high school when I was 15 or 16, not sure when. I got my GED instead then that was it. 

Slowly but surely lost all my friends over that time, but somehow got a girlfriend during that time whom I've been with for almost 7 years now. Sometimes I feel I put too much dependency on her. 

Anyway, I just feel that at my age I should be somewhere else. I still live with my dad, I never went to college, I don't have friends, I've lost all social skills I used to have. Any time I'm around people (which is really fucking rare) I shut down and can't connect so I stay inside like always. 

This new year I plan to go to community college when he spring semester starts but I'm worried I'll bail out of it like I usually do.

train_pid_319	"How do I know if I have depression? : I’m confused because I display symptoms of depression such as a loss in motivation for some activities, wanting to nap constantly (never took naps before), less of an appetite, feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, can’t catch a break, will never be good enough, despair. Even though these feelings are fleeting, almost momentary, they have been more and more present and appearing frequently. 

I have gone through a bad breakup a few months ago, I got rear ended by a truck and was forced to get a new car, and I moved to a new apartment and had to buy essentially all new furniture. So I understand that I am also in a period of transition and that could certainly effect my mindset.

train_pid_326	"I sometimes feel like it’s not depression : Keep in mind I’ve not been diagnosed but its pretty cookie cutter depression. But recently I’ve really been thinking about it and I’m just so sensitive and I don’t really know how to stop it. I will flip my lid over things I’m not even upset over. I’ll have breakdowns about something and then be perfectly fine after. It just feels like I’m not in control of my emotions but not to the extent of bipolar? It’s been this way since I was a kid and the strongest emotion has always either been anger or soul crushing sadness. 

I’ve tried meditations and all that self help shit but it’s so on the spot idk how to stop it from happening. It really runs my life because I don’t ever leave my comfort zone or its a guaranteed meltdown. I want to live again. I don’t wanna be upset all the fucking time. 

I want to know I’ll come home watch some tv like I knew I wanted instead of dissociating halfway through the first episode and all of a sudden hit a low because I’m by myself. How dare I be by myself, even tho that’s all I want all day.

train_pid_356	"Overwhelmed by how little I feel : I've become emotionally numb to the sorts of moments that seemingly used to be exempt from my depression and it's creating this antsy discomfort in me during moments like watching the new year's ball drop where I expect to have a brief respite and instead just continue to feel nothing.

The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense."	moderate
train_pid_357	"Time is running out for the 2010's and I'm absolutely terrified : In less then 30 minutes a new decade will begin.
And I'm so incredibly terrified and utterly hopeless about it.
All my friends are happy about this and I can't just break down like this to ruin the mood.

I'm going to lose so many friends this decade.
I don't even know how to fucking function as an adult. I will remanisce on the memories of me being a kid right now in the future and break down in bed, wishing I could go back in time.
But I can't.
And I can't stop it.

I'm going to miss and wish and beg to come back here, despite the hell I'm living in right now I will want to go back to the nostalgic simplier times and now they're going to go away forever.

I'm never going to have this again.
My family will die.
My friends will go.
People I love will disappear.
And I'm crying now. I am so incredibly deeply shaken inside. I am so petrified and terrified of time itself.
I just want to go back. I want to go back and feel *fucking happy again.*

Time is running out.
And as I hear fireworks outside my room right now I'm desperately clinging to these lasting minutes.

Anyways I see people celebrating with their family, I see 16 of my friends in a party I wasn’t invited to, and my parents don’t care.

My parents are ruining my life, my teenage life. They never let me even go inside my friends houses, ONCE. They’re racist shits saying Americans are the ones who put my brothers in jail. And so what my parents are telling me is my friends will also arrest me?

On top of that they force me to go to events I don’t want to relaying with religion. And not so long ago I spoke out to a counselor they use to abuse me. They closed the case after 2 weeks.

I’m done. I don’t want to kill my self because I believe in my religion and that killing myself will only put me in a darker place. I’m just in a state of mind where I want to die in my sleep peacefully no pain included.

Destroyed the future we had 
And for that I hate you mother 
You’ve made me really mad

Most of them aren’t very nice

I don’t know why I’m here, I’m usually not one to show any emotion, or ask for help, I’ve always been mild and even tempered. Lately I’ve really been struggling though, I deleted my social media’s weeks ago, due to negative interactions, before that I ditched long running games I’d played on my phone, the idea behind that was so that I could focus more time on my family without distractions. I had a drastic shift change at work and I knew time with them was going to be at a premium already and I didn’t want meaningless things taking away from them. My wife struggles with her own anxiety and depression, I don’t want to lump mine on to hers when I don’t full understand it myself, even though to a certain degree I already do, I removed familiar comfort distractions and I never replaced them with constructive creative outlets like I intended. I cut out the empty but never replaced it with anything meaningful, the things that distracted me from the monotony are gone, but all I have right now is the monotonous day in day out. I know my wife sees it, she’s called me out on it, but I shrug it off and say I’m tired. I love my family but right now I feel just feel drained.

None of my so called ""friends"" bothered to even text me. All i can think is if i killed myself right here right now how long would it take till someone found me. Days maybe weeks hell maybe they wouldnt notice until my body started to smell. Its not like anyone checks up on me. The only thing stopping me is my best friend would think its her fault. Noone deserves to be the person that couldve been there to save you right. I was that person when my old best friend killed herself.

train_pid_385	Just talking and rambling on idk : Hey everyone, I mainly just came to post my thoughts and read whatever anyone says or see if anyone has similar experiences or feels the same. Today was probably one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was really looking forward to hanging out and partying with my friends for new years but idk they didnt want to party they wanted to play playstation which is fine I guess but idk we're in our 20s it's new years eve we always used to party but idk so basically I ended up spending it by myself and on top of that I got some weed thinking that would definetly make it better but got either the worst mid ever or some straight cbd bud idk its trash though I know that for sure, but idk for some reason after today and how it went like it just pushed to the point of that's it like I'm done with these people and I wont talk to them anymore, I'm starting all the way over and I'll try to make new friends or whatever, I deleted all my social media theres literally no way for anyone besides my family which is my grandma mom and 2 brothers to contact me. Ive just had a shitty day, but theres a backstory to it, I've always been not necessarily depressed but I usually feel kind of a mix of down and lonely extremely lonely for sure. Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night	moderate

The worst fucking thing of all was my close friend and one of the only people i trust because he was actually supportive of me when i came out to him and told him about my problems moved to a different country and he invited all of us to hang out with him one more time but i missed it because i was out sick from school and didn’t use my phone so he had no way of contacting me which i feel really fucking guilty about and i missed what could have actually been a nice fucking day.

train_pid_401	New decade, hopefully new me : So as of starting this it’s 6 minutes into the new decade and I feel things have been on a very downward trajectory for me. I can’t remember a time when I’ve felt happy while sober so that has been nothing new but recently I’ve noticed my social anxiety getting worse and worse. I’ve stopped making any effort to hang out with my friends, I’ve been putting off going to buy something I need because I’m afraid of interacting with people at the store, and the weirdest thing is I am now pee shy which is something I haven’t struggled with before. I’m going to college next year and I’m worried that if I can’t make progress getting over my social anxiety that I won’t interact with anyone at my school. I passed up invitations to New Years parties and told several friends that I was out of town instead of hanging out.

train_pid_403	"If you don’t want to read this, you don’t have to. I’m just using this as a cathartic rant on the internet. : You know how people write letters and then burn them for catharsis? Well I’m basically doing the same thing but posting in on a website in which I don’t know anybody. This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don’t want to read it or can’t make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.

So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn’t the most surprising fact you’ve heard all day. But I’m a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it’s because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. 
And then there’s the big question:
“Why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?”

From all I’ve seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.

Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.

So I’m a 17 year old male high school student who doesn’t know a thing about life. I’ve just been fucked by and I’m not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world’s attempt to get rid of me. 
I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.

On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I’ll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I’ll leave it there because it doesn’t need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I’m still a virgin. 
Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don’t know what she had told them. I don’t know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I’m pretty sure of who it was, but I’ll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she’s had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I’m really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).
Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that “they could tell anyone, but  don’t tell OP.” 
I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who’d I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I’ll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll be the first one to say that I’m no handsome devil, but I’d admit that I’m a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. 
The other comment that someone made to me I didn’t understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn’t know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I’ve known her from my classes and she’s the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, “That’s the kind of person you are.” I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. I’d tell myself, “If even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.”
So a couple months pass and I’m still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I’m alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I’ll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn’t know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.
I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn’t mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of “It’s been two fucking months, you shouldn’t have waited this long to tell me out it.” We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into “You shouldn’t care if you’ve been assaulted, it’s been two months, you should be over it.” I never said anything along those lines. 
I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don’t know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.
The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I’m a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can’t cry, so I usually don’t. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything to them.
That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn’t want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says “oh you can talk to me.” These people don’t want you to talk to them, and they know that you won’t reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won’t be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can’t be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that’s the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone’s death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. 
I feel like that’s the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don’t kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren’t suicidal then you’re allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It’s hypocritical bullshit.

This is why I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about anything. I’m feeling suicidal right now, but I don’t even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it’s like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can’t think of anything else besides that. 
Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she’s a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. 

.......

I’m mostly done with this but I’ll add a few more notes at the end
- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her 
- Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)
- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumors

TLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important"	moderate

train_pid_412	"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine."	moderate

train_pid_414	"parents suck : I’m very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn’t really affect me except for with my family. I’m not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we’re currently in and spent the night outside (we’re on a ski vacation, it get’s below -15°C here at night). Said I have to go to therapy for being annoyed (I’ve went to therapy before, it really did not work for me). My mother joined in and asked why I couldn’t just be a normal child.

train_pid_415	Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.	moderate

train_pid_418	"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. 

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.

These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try...

I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??	moderate

Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.

I dont feel like I can do another decade of this. I cant do this anymore."	moderate
train_pid_442	"2019 was my worst year with 2 depression crisis. I'm happy it ended but so afraid of what 2020 will bring. : This years was rough. It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again. During all of these I had to leave university for the year as I couldn't deal with the pression at the time. The thing is I study Industrial Engineer and I'm working as a Marketing E   Commerce Analyst for Dell.com.br. I don't know if I want to keep with my engineering program, but I'm not that away from finishing it. 

Long story short, I'm lost and don't know what to expect from 2020. I'm just relieved 2019 ended, but I'm really afraid of what 2020 will bring."	moderate

train_pid_447	I want to begin the long journey of breaking out of my depression. Any ideas on how to do this lads? : I’m tired of feeling this way and the start to a new decade is the perfect time to start the long process. Only problem is I don’t really know where to begin. Any ideas?	moderate
train_pid_448	Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for with this post, I’m more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading	moderate

train_pid_452	I’m not going to kill myself but... : I know I’m not making it in 2020. I can’t stop posting about my shit here. I’ve lost everyone who actually knew me. And I can’t stop being depressed. I can’t say I’m suicidal nor have suicidal thoughts because I don’t want to get sectioned. It’s unfortunate that I have to lie but I know my fate. Everyone is getting married, having kids, getting their careers, finding peace...I’m still not over my dads death. Nor the fact I got used, or the fact I was manipulated. But hey it was all me. I read the self help books and I know it’s my fault. Again I can’t kill myself but if i could, it would be for that reason. I’m not suicidal nor do I want to die, but I can’t get out of this downward spiral. I know there’s no hope no cure. Depression is situationally brought on. I wasn’t always this way but circumstances have brought me here. I’m not making sense since I’m just writing off the top of my head so I’ll stop now. I have tried to change based off of what my influencers tell me, off of what my therapist tells me, of what society tells me-and I’ve accepted I’m doomed.	moderate

train_pid_456	"My family loves me, but I hate myself. : I have always been a smart, optimistic child. I was one of the best at my school. I always made everyone proud.
But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now. I guess I just have to go through these two weeks.

train_pid_459	"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent."	moderate

train_pid_462	Another shitty new year. : I think it's fair to say that the past few years (since 2014 or so) each year got gradually worse and worse. Now here we are. 2020. I'm at an all-time high of depression, loneliness, and other issues I won't bore you with. Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore. Let's all hope that 2020 brings on new opportunities and new positivity into all our lives. I invite anybody to take a shot with me as the clock strikes midnight. We may not be celebrating together in person, but that shot will bring us all together for that split moment. Cheers, and happy New Year everybody.	moderate

I just act like that because sit helps me get away from my feelings and how I’m
feeling. My girlfriend moved to Florida and she was honestly the only thing that made me happy and actually cherish life. But now... I’m just depressed and fucking wish I wasn’t here. I’m just stressed about school and I don’t have anyone to just go to and hug when I need to, I never have and I doubt I ever will.

train_pid_467	"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

Anyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us"	moderate

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever been in a situation similar to mine?

I know I have a good heart. But its not enough is it. You need to feel part of something. Companionship. I was a good looking young person. Now I am not young. Now I am not good looking. Now I can't bear to see my family at Christmas because of the inherent wrongness I feel when someone asks me a generic question about life. 'So, how are you?'

I think I could be transgender. Entirely possible. But also maybe wrong. Knowing is the key. If you know you can live. And love. Typo you didn't see. If you don't know? You are dead.

train_pid_485	Am I depressed or is this just a rough patch(vent) : This is probably going to sound stupid but I don’t know if I should seek help because of how i’ve been feeling lately or if this is just a rough time and it’ll get better over time. Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it’s been very hard trying to get him a job (he’s 24 and it’s all he asks about). He’s even been asking me if he can live with me when i’m older and ready to move out of my moms house. It’s all just too much and i don’t even know where my heads at. I didn’t mean to make this post THAT long but I just don’t know what I should do. Should I seek help? Or will everything get better over time ....	moderate
train_pid_486	"Jeez, looking back at the decade is horribly depressed. From 15 to 25, almost NOTHING changed for the good. : I believe I dropped out of high school when I was 15 or 16, not sure when. I got my GED instead then that was it. 

Slowly but surely lost all my friends over that time, but somehow got a girlfriend during that time whom I've been with for almost 7 years now. Sometimes I feel I put too much dependency on her. 

Anyway, I just feel that at my age I should be somewhere else. I still live with my dad, I never went to college, I don't have friends, I've lost all social skills I used to have. Any time I'm around people (which is really fucking rare) I shut down and can't connect so I stay inside like always. 

This new year I plan to go to community college when he spring semester starts but I'm worried I'll bail out of it like I usually do. 

I don't know, I just feel fucking old and like I'm wasting my youth.  

I want to make this next decade better, I'm optimistic but I can't help look at the past and wonder what could have been."	moderate
train_pid_487	Alone on Nye (another holiday) again : I'm so tired of being alone all the time. I'm trying to be a good person, meet peoole, do things. And just like my 30th birthday earlier this past year I'm alone again. I've reached out to people and been ghosted I've asked and been told one thing and then they disappear. I've asked on Facebook, I've looked online. And that's it just another Nye alone by myself without a single fuck from anyone. It's hard enough dealing with depression and not using as it is.

I feel very alone. And its scares me. I feel like a pansy saying that, seeing that I'm such a big guy with a lot of care. I want to tell them ""Hey I'm not doing very well."" But they're all drunk or high and I can't actually get my thoughts across to them.

train_pid_494	"How do I know if I have depression? : I’m confused because I display symptoms of depression such as a loss in motivation for some activities, wanting to nap constantly (never took naps before), less of an appetite, feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, can’t catch a break, will never be good enough, despair. Even though these feelings are fleeting, almost momentary, they have been more and more present and appearing frequently. 

I have gone through a bad breakup a few months ago, I got rear ended by a truck and was forced to get a new car, and I moved to a new apartment and had to buy essentially all new furniture. So I understand that I am also in a period of transition and that could certainly effect my mindset.

train_pid_6099	"My girlfriend is thinking about cutting and I’m not sure how to go about this topic : Hey guys,

So I’ll just give a little background (theres not much that needs to be said really). I’m a M18 and she’s a F16 and we are about 2 months into our official relationship after talking for about 2 months beforehand. She has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better ______(body part like legs or waist). She has told me about how she’s had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. She has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself (which almost everyone does though idk i just thought I should ad even though thats a different topic entirely). She also tends to have severe anxiety (or something) attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. In an effort to be there for her I’ve tried to do the following things (these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike):

- make it known that I am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she’s feeling down.
- actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. Being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it.
- make sure that when we talk about it I focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings (and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess). Also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something
-making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she didn’t have these thoughts so no random (“how are you feeling” etc...)
- and I’ve told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever!

Now I’d be lying if i said I haven’t messed up with doing/keeping those things (in mind). I have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. I’ve kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. Also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it’s just a really sensitive topic as we all know. 

I was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. Any pointers on what I could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? Is there something im not doing that I should be doing? Is there something im doing that I shouldn’t be doing? I love her a lot and I really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts/feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody’s job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this.

Thanks to anyone who responds! You are all loved ❤️"	not depression

train_pid_6105	NYE doesn't mean anything. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're spending it alone. : I kinda find the idea of new year's resolution incredibly stupid. What makes people think that they'll be able to change their lives only because a number has changed. I've had a lot of great periods in my life where I achieved things I'm still proud of to this day, but none of which had anything to do with a new year's resolution. If you wanna change your life, you can start right now. And if you fucked up today, start tomorrow, not next year. Where I live, NYE has passed, and guess what, I spent it alone, and I'm happy about it. I learned that the best friendship one can ever have is a friendship with oneself. So learn how to enjoy your company. The most important thing is to love yourself, because you've been there for yourself all along and you deserve your love. One last thing I'll say is that you should stop looking at what other people are doing. People can and will do whatever their hearts desire, and that's none of our business. They can do whatever they want because we will do whatever we want too.	not depression

Tonight, though... 

I’m back at home with my parents right now and they live out in the country. It’s New Years, and country folk love their fireworks. I decided to sit up on the roof of the house and take it all in.

But really she’s just using you
And your too blind to spot it 

The fights and shouts are hurtful
You know something’s not right 
She’s used to be so fruitful 
Changed without a sight 

She grows more and more distant 
You struggle to close the gap

And she won’t give a crap

She doesn’t love you no more

I would like to have a house close to the sea in a warm place for example, a lot of money, family, children, live in a country and have a job that I like and hobbies i love when I am 70. The more you focus on it, the faster you'll be there and live it and don't waste your time and energy on nonsense that won't take you anywhere. I have already reached 60%-70% and i'm 40.

And your too blind to spot it

You know something’s not right 
She’s used to be so fruitful 
Changed without a sight 

She grows more and more distant 
You struggle to close the gap

train_pid_6339	"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week."	not depression

You may not feel able to change anything. What's the point right? But this year i decided to do some things that may not make me any happier, but will be good and practical hings for me to do that could make me feel normal if i keep doing them:

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to have completed a course of Therapy

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do.

You have many more months ahead of you to better yourself. Don’t be so hard on yourself and self evaluate to the point where you put yourself down. Be easy on yourself.

Tonight, though... 

I’m back at home with my parents right now and they live out in the country. It’s New Years, and country folk love their fireworks. I decided to sit up on the roof of the house and take it all in. I’m so glad I did. When it struck 12 the entire horizon lit up for a solid 2 minutes - as far as I could see in nearly every direction. It was one of the best moments of my life.

Just to keep you in her pocket
But really she’s just using you
And your too blind to spot it 

The fights and shouts are hurtful
You know something’s not right 
She’s used to be so fruitful 
Changed without a sight 

She grows more and more distant 
You struggle to close the gap
Soon you’ll be nonexistent 
And she won’t give a crap 

Then one day you’ll give in
She doesn’t love you no more

train_pid_6414	"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week."	not depression

You may not feel able to change anything. What's the point right? But this year i decided to do some things that may not make me any happier, but will be good and practical hings for me to do that could make me feel normal if i keep doing them:

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to have completed a course of Therapy

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do. They won't change anything right away but a change of habits is something more beneficial than you think. I think of Depression as a stillness. Moving sometimes by doing these simple mundane things are worth doing for yourself. What little things do you think you could start doing?"	not depression

We’ve all made it into 2020, even though some of us have been hanging by a thread. With a new year ahead of us, let’s think of what’s been going *right* in our lives.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August.

train_pid_6429	"Advice: How to Keep Up With Responsibilities? : Hey everyone. This year I'm going to aim for keeping up with my chores and getting into a healthier routine. 

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back. 

Any tips on how to handle responsibilities and a healthy routine? I've tried a checklist idea (wake up, make bed, brush teeth, eat breakfast, etc.) but never follow through with it. 

Thanks guys."	not depression

You know something’s not right 
She’s used to be so fruitful 
Changed without a sight 

She grows more and more distant 
You struggle to close the gap

train_pid_6503	"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week."	not depression

You may not feel able to change anything. What's the point right? But this year i decided to do some things that may not make me any happier, but will be good and practical hings for me to do that could make me feel normal if i keep doing them:

I want to get a job and start saving up some money

I want to get a tattoo

I  want to finish College with a top grade and Apply/Be accepted into University

I want to start practicing photography again

I want to buy and read more books

I want to start a blog

I want to have completed a course of Therapy

I want to leave the house and go outside more at least 5 times a week

I will start taking Vitamins every morning again

I will try and be awake before 12pm from now on

I will have at least one conversation a day

These arw things that do not have to be done every day but give me something to focus on and give me things to do. They won't change anything right away but a change of habits is something more beneficial than you think. I think of Depression as a stillness.

train_pid_6515	"What are you thankful for? : Depression has a way of casting gloom over everything, stripping out the colors and turning the world grey. We’ve all made it into 2020, even though some of us have been hanging by a thread. With a new year ahead of us, let’s think of what’s been going *right* in our lives.

I’ll start: 2019 was pretty rough for me. I spent the entire year studying without a real break, and my girlfriend and I have been on the edge of breaking up since August. This has put me in some very dark places. But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I’m on to writing essays now), and I’m really thankful that things at least look better than they were. I’m hoping that 2020 can somehow bring more peace to my life than 2019 did, and I’m thankful for that chance."	not depression

train_pid_6518	"Advice: How to Keep Up With Responsibilities? : Hey everyone. This year I'm going to aim for keeping up with my chores and getting into a healthier routine. 

My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back. 

Any tips on how to handle responsibilities and a healthy routine? I've tried a checklist idea (wake up, make bed, brush teeth, eat breakfast, etc.) but never follow through with it. 

Thanks guys."	not depression

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I was about to go on a vacation with him and on the last day my sister said I can’t go and threatened me that she’ll call the police and my mom pretended to have a heart attack and it ended up being just gastric and she was discharged in a day. So many fake people around me. They took my only happiness away from him, my boyfriend lost a lot of money on the booking of the vacation and he’s mad at me. I can’t blame him, he can’t be mad at my family so he’s mad at me. I lost everything in a day. My family would let a sexual molester in the house who raped me but couldn’t let me go with a man I’ve been with for 5 years. Even though they’re my adopted family and gave me a second chance, they are too possessive over me, somebody please help me to get out of this house, help me to end this pain, is there a painless way to kill myself? I’m scared of death. A part of me wants to live, I want to get help but they’re not sending me to a psychiatrist because they think depression is an abnormality, they want to be a perfect kid who marches to their drums and don’t feel anything. I really wanna give up, I’ve lost everything and I can’t see everything go away from me anymore. Help me. I want to grow old, I’m just 18 and I’m losing my will to live. I know it’s new year and all but for me I’m looking at the same four walls for years. It’s like I’m in a mental asylum. My school tore me apart and shattered me, my own family betrayed me, my only true love that I held on to is leaving me. I want it to stop. I wanna stop crying. Please. Help. Me.	severe

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

train_pid_8048	"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety."	severe

train_pid_8050	"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me."	severe
train_pid_8062	"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe
train_pid_8063	"Why am I fucking angry crying : I started dieting, I shaved off a few shitty traits, I tried and tried and succeeded and failed and accepted it all because I can't do anything about that past anyways. 

AND I FUCKING LIVED! i made it to 17. I made it to 2020. After all the plans and scares, well fuck I'm here.

So why the hell did I run to my bed and start crying. Not sobbing m, closer to the crying you get from hollowness. Like a regret that never got fixed. Tbh I might be having a stroke, I smell burning and there definitely isn't burning.

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop? All these stupid people I made in my head that haunt ever facet of life. Fuck you all, I'm tired. And I'm sorry but I'm bleeding. And tired. Time for sleep. Sleepity sleep.

train_pid_8068	"At this point just genuinely curious what sort of shit 2020 throws my way : It's actually funny. I used to end every previous year with ""Okay, that was bad, but surely it can't get much worse!! You can only go up from rock bottom!1!!11!"", only to get fucked in the most unimaginable ways by the next year, to the point where I've mostly dissociated from my own existence and it's nothing more than a bad fucking movie. 



I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations!

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me."	severe
train_pid_8085	"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe
train_pid_8086	"Why am I fucking angry crying : I started dieting, I shaved off a few shitty traits, I tried and tried and succeeded and failed and accepted it all because I can't do anything about that past anyways. 

AND I FUCKING LIVED! i made it to 17. I made it to 2020. After all the plans and scares, well fuck I'm here.

So why the hell did I run to my bed and start crying. Not sobbing m, closer to the crying you get from hollowness. Like a regret that never got fixed. Tbh I might be having a stroke, I smell burning and there definitely isn't burning.

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop? All these stupid people I made in my head that haunt ever facet of life. Fuck you all, I'm tired. And I'm sorry but I'm bleeding. And tired. Time for sleep. Sleepity sleep. Fucking nightmares again right? Just live every fucking nught fot the last forever. Fuck you, at meast kill me this time."	severe
train_pid_8087	"I think i’m going to kill myself : everything is getting bad again, my trauma and body issues are resurfacing, my relationship is failing and it’s all my fault, i’ve lost my will to live, school is fucking awful (i’m getting bullied and the school couldn’t give less of a fuck), i’m so fucking stupid and depression is making it worse and i just don’t want to be alive anymore.

But i can’t kill myself yet, i don’t want anyone to miss me"	severe
train_pid_8088	Im a time bomb : Im the stereotype for you know what. And to be honest it's not far off. I have a deep hatred for people, they made me this way. Meds ruined my fucking life... Pills are not a fucking cure-all, They dont know how to handle someone with mental Illnesses so they dope them up until they feel the poor bastard is under control. Therapists and psychiatrists are full of shit just some quacks. Im just gonna say it...Abilify ruined my fucking life it's probably the cause for everything.	severe

train_pid_8090	"Parents, Indian parents... Help [20M] : So, my mom considers me a psycho and gives me the typical ""don't be sad, it's all in your mind"" talks every goddamn day. How do I educate her on how bad depression can be? I'm on meds and my therapist doesn't want to talk with my parents, yet, but it's killing me. It's been an year since I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder."	severe
train_pid_8091	"I have way too many mental (and other) problems to fix and depression is the “lightest” one. : Tbh, I wish I only had depression instead of all of those mental problems like: OCD, ADD, BDD, social anxiety, addictions, apophenia, maladaptive daydreaming AND depression on top...
Everyday I wakeup and try to push my time away so I can eat (because thats all I enjoy) I dont enjoy any other activity I do. I try to workout, I do it regulary and I meditate everyday and I do keto which helps, but its so hard when you are addicted and food is only thing on my mind... Im also paranoid 100% of the time, scared to meet certain people because I see them as a sign that I am ugly (yeah... apophenia, ocd and bdd causes me to think in that way, I cant explain, it sounds weird when you try to explain it). I do rituals to keep myself safe, im scared of a lot of things: people, height, sounds. I just feel so broken with all of those problems. Im lonely too, i only have my mom to talk to. I cant make connections with other people. Anyways, no wonder why im suicidal..,"	severe
train_pid_8092	"I don’t want to live my life sick and tired : I have a chronic pain/fatigue condition that will be lifelong. Treatments aren’t helping (not unusual for the condition) and everyday is hell. 

It’s looking like I’ll have to leave school
because my cognitive function is too heavily affected and I’m too sleepy to make it to and thru classes. I can’t work enough to pay my expenses and I headed towards disability...which I don’t really see any point in living then. 

I don’t respond to CBT. I’ve tried it multiple times over the years and my therapist said it’s time to stop. I’m too mentally and physically ill for regular treatments and have to experiment.

I want so bad to die young. I don’t want to be awake anymore. I feel so sick right now."	severe
train_pid_8093	This world is making me go insane : Its the first day of 2020 and i hope that everyone else sees the world in my perspective but i just cant take it anymore i know someone will disagree with me and proably downvote this post for having a different opinion but I’m just gonna say it when these HK protest started i didn’t care but when i heard of people getting hurt on both sides i started to act a little skeptical and concerned one day i posted a video of a chinese man getting set on fire on r/morbidlyreality and all i got was “this is fake” and “your just the ten cent army” and when i saw a picture of a protestor who got hit in the face with a gas canister everyone was supporting him and saying whoever did this were monsters and I’m like ok then so i can sucker punch an old man for having a different opinion but if he has your opinion then I’m the monster this revelation just changed everything its all “FREE HK” i see everywhere but never stopping and thinking “maybe my side has done bad things too” but when i say this I’m suddenly the dumbass who hates democracy all of you are just saying this because it looks cool and never think fuck all of you its making me insane i don’t know what to do all i hear is HK HK HK i just want it to stop i want people to just be kind to each other i don’t know  what to do anymore	severe

train_pid_8096	"I feel like killing myself would be the only to make my existence meaningful : 1) I feel like an asshole for admitting this, but I know my family and friends would suffer and I want them to. I feel like it's the only way to make anyone FEEL anything, that I'll be permanently in their memories if I do that, and that I'm just an afterthought if I continue living.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff."	severe
train_pid_8097	I can’t life anymore : The frustration of being untethered to life, floating away and still failing at disappearing, is unmatched.	severe
train_pid_8098	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it. Funny how the worst time of my life, now seems like it was the best.	severe
train_pid_8099	"Happy New Years : I started the new year by my cutting my wrists. 

Why am I like this. Why did I do this. Why do I feel this way.

I've never done this before and I feel ashamed. Im too old for this. I don't think I can speak to my friends or husband about this. I just feel lost and alone and I dont know what to do."	severe
train_pid_8100	I'm honestly shocked I made it this far : I've been suicidal for 2 years now with a whole bunch of failed attempts in between and the year 2020 comes in with a blink if an eye. I dont even know how to process this but to feel shocked. With each suicide attempt (the latest one being a couple of weeks ago) I was damn sure. So damn sure. But wtf. Days, months and years pass and I'm stuck playing catchup because I cant successfully get rid of myself.	severe

train_pid_8104	"I am a terrible person. : Originally posted this to /offmychest but I guess it fits here too.
I’m literally on my last leg...I fucked up my relationship with the man and I love which ruined New Year’s Eve and, this past day I’ve been so depressed and sick to my stomach yet I just wanted to drink again WHY DO I ALWAYS NEED A DRUG TO SUPPRESS MY NATURAL STATE WHY AM I FUCKED UP LIKE THIS I STG I HAD SO MANY THOUGHTS OF JUST ENDING IT IDK WHY IVE BEEN CURSED WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN MY FMILY IS NORMAL. I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe
train_pid_8105	My suicide is inevitable : I’ve been suicidal for years and I’m getting sick of feeling like this and I think it’s just time I commit and do it. I feel like no matter if I do ever make progress I’ll always revert back to this and one day I’ll end up killing myself anyway there’s no way that I will escape this. Why suffer any longer when I could just die now and not have to go through disappointment later?	severe
train_pid_8106	"At this point just genuinely curious what sort of shit 2020 throws my way : It's actually funny. I used to end every previous year with ""Okay, that was bad, but surely it can't get much worse!! You can only go up from rock bottom!1!!11!"", only to get fucked in the most unimaginable ways by the next year, to the point where I've mostly dissociated from my own existence and it's nothing more than a bad fucking movie. 



I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations! 
So what will it be this time? Homelessness? Another chronic illness? Or perhaps my family finally disowns me? 

Stay tuned!"	severe

Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  

Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up. 

Happy f&amp;\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.

I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

train_pid_8109	"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety."	severe

train_pid_8111	"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way"	severe

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

Before, I was just very afraid of death and couldn’t avoid it. By filling up my schedule I was able to avoid it in a decent way, so I was cruising for a little while. But now, everything is coming crashing down! I am losing my ability to hold conversations, the ability to focus, and the ability to enjoy things. I don’t want to do anything. I really just want to sit at home and sleep. Also, my habits are really fucked! I don’t really get hungry or tired, so I eat about 1 meal a day which my parents tell me to eat.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

train_pid_8136	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it.

It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery.

train_pid_8150	"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.
Also english isnt my first language so if have messed up the grammar or something somewhere you know why"	severe

You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation.

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career.

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse.

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it.

train_pid_8164	I've picked a date : So, I think I've come to a decision, after living with depression for nearly 30 years. I think this is the year, I've picked a date to end my life if things don't look up by then; I don't plan on sharing it but I think it's right. I don't need major changes to change this, minor things will do but I'm pretty sure nothing will change by then. I have no motivation or willpower in myself to win any of the small tasks in life; I can barely get out of bed some days... &amp; death is all I think about since I enjoy nothing in this society or world.	severe

train_pid_8167	Agh. I wish I wasn’t like this! : I am very unhappy with my current situation. I am almost always in a state of dread. I got diagnosed with clinical depression or whatever a few years back, and I took pills and shit and went to therapy but after the pills didn’t do anything and I didn’t have time for therapy so I stopped treatment (that seemed to have little to no effect). Before, I was just very afraid of death and couldn’t avoid it. By filling up my schedule I was able to avoid it in a decent way, so I was cruising for a little while. But now, everything is coming crashing down! I am losing my ability to hold conversations, the ability to focus, and the ability to enjoy things. I don’t want to do anything. I really just want to sit at home and sleep. Also, my habits are really fucked! I don’t really get hungry or tired, so I eat about 1 meal a day which my parents tell me to eat. Currently writing this post at 4:17 AM so I think that gives you an idea of my sleeping habits. Also, I can’t seem to feel any intimacy for other people? Then why am I so horny? Fucking hell	severe
train_pid_8168	"What is there? 2020 is just a number I have to endure until I give up : It’s not new, it’s just a day, I can’t feel awake or connected to the world 80% of the time.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me."	severe
train_pid_8169	"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe

So why the hell did I run to my bed and start crying. Not sobbing m, closer to the crying you get from hollowness. Like a regret that never got fixed. Tbh I might be having a stroke, I smell burning and there definitely isn't burning.

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop? All these stupid people I made in my head that haunt ever facet of life. Fuck you all, I'm tired. And I'm sorry but I'm bleeding. And tired. Time for sleep. Sleepity sleep.

Everyday I wakeup and try to push my time away so I can eat (because thats all I enjoy) I dont enjoy any other activity I do. I try to workout, I do it regulary and I meditate everyday and I do keto which helps, but its so hard when you are addicted and food is only thing on my mind... Im also paranoid 100% of the time, scared to meet certain people because I see them as a sign that I am ugly (yeah... apophenia, ocd and bdd causes me to think in that way, I cant explain, it sounds weird when you try to explain it). I do rituals to keep myself safe, im scared of a lot of things: people, height, sounds. I just feel so broken with all of those problems. Im lonely too, i only have my mom to talk to.

I don’t respond to CBT. I’ve tried it multiple times over the years and my therapist said it’s time to stop. I’m too mentally and physically ill for regular treatments and have to experiment.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff."	severe

train_pid_8182	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it. Funny how the worst time of my life, now seems like it was the best.	severe

I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with.

The holidays make me so miserable and so does winter. I know winter wont end soon but I'm so glad the holidays will. It's not just me. I see so many people actually miserable. Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery. I wish a drunk driver would have put me out of my suffering last night.	severe
train_pid_8196	"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what.

One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety.

I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

train_pid_8213	"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety."	severe

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way"	severe

It's only make my family expect me to be great which I never had any idea how to be. Right now I feel I'm unbelievably stupid. I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

I got diagnosed with clinical depression or whatever a few years back, and I took pills and shit and went to therapy but after the pills didn’t do anything and I didn’t have time for therapy so I stopped treatment (that seemed to have little to no effect). Before, I was just very afraid of death and couldn’t avoid it. By filling up my schedule I was able to avoid it in a decent way, so I was cruising for a little while. But now, everything is coming crashing down! I am losing my ability to hold conversations, the ability to focus, and the ability to enjoy things. I don’t want to do anything. I really just want to sit at home and sleep. Also, my habits are really fucked! I don’t really get hungry or tired, so I eat about 1 meal a day which my parents tell me to eat.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

train_pid_8227	"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop?

train_pid_8240	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it.

I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery.

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

train_pid_8262	What it do, why is this. : So I’ve grown up with parents who were not a good pair. They fought a lot and screamed at each other my whole growing up.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what.

train_pid_8265	"Going in and out of happy and depressed. : I feel like this has always been a thing with me. A lot of days I'm just depressed the entire day, but most of them (especially recently) I seem to move in and out of short bursts of mania and depression. One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind."	severe

train_pid_8267	"I have to go back on a higher dose and I hate admitting it : A couple months ago, I talked with my doctor about going on a lower dose of my antidepressant because it was affecting my memory and sleep (so we thought)

My wife and I made jokes that I was on such a high dosage, I was basically on horse tranquilizers.  

Two months ago, I went on a lower dose and everything was fine.  I just took less and didn't feel worse or better.  Maybe a little less sluggish and my memory was a bit better (I had troubles remembering some stuff).  

The last two months have been great except for the last couple weeks.  

It started with more worry.  I started thinking and stressing about is everything okay?  Is my relationship in a good place?  Is my wife happy?  Am I doing everything I can at work?  Why can't I do better in general?

I shrugged it off just being regular stresses and took this holiday season to just relax and enjoy.  It was going fine, but still I had nagging stresses and felt myself going into a bigger and bigger hole every time something not ideal happened.  I would be down for hours afterwards and I wasn't about to admit to myself or my wife that I wasn't doing well.   

I pushed so hard to be okay that a couple days ago, something very trivial happened where I took it to heart and a few days later, it was all I could think about when I was about to go to sleep, going to the movies, with friends or family.  

I've come to the conclusion that I need to go back up a little on my dosage like I was before.  My depression is back.  My doctor said if I started feeling it, I should go back up to the old dosage. (1/2 a pill instead of a 1/3)  

I feel like a failure.  My depression is still there and I can't beat it without medication.

My sleep is still the same on both dosages.  My memory will get worse possibly.  Maybe my methods I've built in remembering will help and I can not fall back into forgetting things.

But I'd rather be forgetful than frustrated, sad, angry, and overall unpleasant to be with the past couple weeks.  

I'm not suicidal at all, I'm not wanting to harm myself, I'm just sad and it's affecting my overall happiness in life and it's causing strain on my relationships.


I'm waiting for my wife to come home to talk to her about it and I know she's going to be supportive, but I'm in such a hole that I feel like she won't be.  I'm so in my head.  

Can I get some support?  

P.S.  If I do show my wife this, and now she's reading this, I'm sorry for the past couple weeks of shit.  I love you and my depression is no indicator how happy and in love I am with you.  You are my best friend and you didn't do anything wrong.  I know this is hard for you to fully understand, so, thank you for your love and support always :)"	severe
train_pid_8268	"Any advice? : So... I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  
I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  
don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:

I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself.

 I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  
I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.

Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  
My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  
He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.

And then there's me.  
I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  
I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  
Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.

Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  
I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.

train_pid_8270	"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.


Thank you so much!"	severe
train_pid_8271	"I’m so empty : I wake up to the malevolent glare of life once again. I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. 


I’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. 

I don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore 

Depression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.


Not quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don’t want to live like this anymore. Any advice is appreciated"	severe

And because of this I can't kill myself. I would feel too guilty. I've now been in a depression for a long time and it's getting worst and worst really fast. It's actually come to a point where I'm hoping that my parents will die/kill themself/tell me that they don't care about me, or anything that could let me kill myself in peace.

train_pid_8273	"Being single makes everything worse... : My whole life i’ve been alone. I’ve been with handful of women here and there but never anything even remotely  serious. As I grow older (I’m 24) all my friends are settled down with someone. Married, kids, engaged, long relationships.

I’ve always been single. And the sad part is, I don’t know what i do wrong. I’m a good man, passionate about my goals, caring for others, funny, good looking, and social. But i’ve suffered greatly from OCD and depression and even with my wall up, people seem to look at me as insecure or weak (my only justification). It’s almost as if all the good qualities of mine go away. The cycle goes that women are attracted to me when they meet me, but as the weeks go on they get unattracted and put me as their friend.

Over 24 years you have enough of feeling like you’re not good enough. Tired of seeing your friends scoring dates and one night stands. Tired of the random dude at the bar picking up the woman you like. I decided to not even try anymore but it still hurts that EVERYone i know looks at me as the “always single and alone” guy.

train_pid_8274	"Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.

I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.

But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. 

Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.

I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. 

I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. 

I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.

The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. 

I think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though."	severe
train_pid_8275	Best antidepressant for major depressive disorder? : I’m currently on Adderall 30 mg twice a day and have been since 2014.

train_pid_8276	"Why is it that talking to people about depression is so hard? : Heyo everyone. I'm usually a chipper person outwardly in my day-to-day life. It's all a facade, of course, but I feel like a lot of folks with depression do the same. I'm constantly telling people to be positive, giving career advice, and overall trying to be a decent person for my wife, kids, and co-workers (not my friends, as I have literally none since I graduated college).

Keeping with that, why do I have such a problem talking to my wife about my depression? I feel stupid for complaining about my anxiety over money, debt, and bills. I feel like I'm just bitching when I complain about having to work from home because of a sleep disorder I have. I know I'm a hypocrite when I say ""I need to lose weight"" and then just have absolutely no motivation to actually do it. I whinge about how much my job makes me want to just kill myself but then stick with it because ""It pays the bills."" 

I just make excuses for everything and whinge about everything which leads to me just trying to keep it inside instead. My doctor told me the other day that my sleep apnea (not the disorder I mentioned, that's another one) is extremely severe because I'm so overweight; why don't I just lose the weight? I couldn't bring myself to answer with ""because I'm an unmotivated fat fuck that values my life less than I value the brief happiness I get from drinking soda.""

It's behaviour that we know is self-destructive and I don't want to think I'm the only person that keeps everything bottled up. It leads to days where I'm just really on edge and I feel like even more of a burden than I usually do. The only reason I keep going is because my family needs me for money at this point.

I just wanted a forum where I could whine some without being judged too harshly. Cheers."	severe
train_pid_8277	Just passing time : I just turned 35 and for a long time I've dealt with depression. I had a abusive childhood and alot of abandonment issues stemming from my mom. Growing up around drugs and all around bad environment. Bouncing from place to place. The one steady thing I felt I had to turn to was my dad. He passed away about 9 years ago from a pill addiction. Before he passed away I adopted my first real pet (dog) that helped me with my depression. A few years I got another dog and things where ok. Still dealt with depression but not as bad. In March of 2019 my first dog passed away. I felt completely lost and my depression came back ten fold. Then my current girlfriend of 3yrs told me she was pregnant. During this time we didnt live together. She kept wanting me to move in with her and her 2 boys. Which I did. My whole life changed. Now she had the baby, and my other dog is getting aggressive and acting out. So we fight about the dog all the time which is making my depression worse and my anxiety through the roof. She knows I won't get rid of the dog because it helps my depression. I wanna be there for my baby but I cant see fighting with my girlfriend every day. But it's to a point where I think about suicide on a daily basis. If I knew I could do it right and not feel anything I would go through with it. So until  I move out with the dog or give her up I'm just here passing time.. just dont know why I'm even here.	severe

Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  

Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up. 

Happy f&amp;\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.

I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.
If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.

train_pid_8284	"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety."	severe

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  

I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way"	severe
train_pid_8287	"Help. : I'm 24 and I'm useless, I have studies in programming and sadly had been fairly smart through my life, but it does not even matter. It's only make my family expect me to be great which I never had any idea how to be. Right now I feel I'm unbelievably stupid. I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

I got diagnosed with clinical depression or whatever a few years back, and I took pills and shit and went to therapy but after the pills didn’t do anything and I didn’t have time for therapy so I stopped treatment (that seemed to have little to no effect). Before, I was just very afraid of death and couldn’t avoid it. By filling up my schedule I was able to avoid it in a decent way, so I was cruising for a little while. But now, everything is coming crashing down! I am losing my ability to hold conversations, the ability to focus, and the ability to enjoy things. I don’t want to do anything. I really just want to sit at home and sleep. Also, my habits are really fucked! I don’t really get hungry or tired, so I eat about 1 meal a day which my parents tell me to eat.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

train_pid_8298	"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe

I'm going mad again. All the bad things I tried to get rid of are comjng back. The toxic attitude, the rampant cursing, the obsessiveness, the lack of social filters. Fuck why can't it just stop?

train_pid_8311	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it.

I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe

I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery. I wish a drunk driver would have put me out of my suffering last night.	severe
train_pid_8325	"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what.

I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety.

train_pid_8342	"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.

I was so close to ending my suffering, my constant piercing pain. instead here i am full of hatred towards my body and being, aching with anxiety and fear of faillure and addicted to all sorts of substances. i have a dream and my very dream is nine months away, i’ve wanted to go to medschool ever since i can remember and i’m one interview away from accomplishing all i’ve ever wanted yet i can’t be bothered waiting another 3/4 of year nor do i know for sure that my childhood fantasy isn’t but an illusion that will never fullfill my inner emptiness.

I missed 28 days of school because some days I don’t feel like getting up in the morning my grades are bad school is not my thing I hate doing things that are not going to help me in my future. You may call me lazy but I physically can’t get up I don’t know what I wanna be in life my grandma passed god has not helped me not once I don’t know.

train_pid_8354	I could just end it.... : I could just kill myself and no one would know or care. I'm a burden to my friends and my family and now the only person I ever trusted to talk to about how I'm doing wants nothing to do with me anymore. I'm completely alone, worthless, and hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to make it through this year and no I won't see a therapist, I don't trust therapy and I never have, it's a waste of money. Mental health is not worth that much to me. Deep down I wish someone would commit an act of violence wherever I am at a given time and would kill me so I could spare my family knowing I'd killed myself. It's over, I have nothing.

I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations!

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me.

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up.

The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it.

train_pid_8369	I've picked a date : So, I think I've come to a decision, after living with depression for nearly 30 years.

I don't need major changes to change this, minor things will do but I'm pretty sure nothing will change by then. I have no motivation or willpower in myself to win any of the small tasks in life; I can barely get out of bed some days... &amp; death is all I think about since I enjoy nothing in this society or world.	severe

I got diagnosed with clinical depression or whatever a few years back, and I took pills and shit and went to therapy but after the pills didn’t do anything and I didn’t have time for therapy so I stopped treatment (that seemed to have little to no effect). Before, I was just very afraid of death and couldn’t avoid it. By filling up my schedule I was able to avoid it in a decent way, so I was cruising for a little while. But now, everything is coming crashing down! I am losing my ability to hold conversations, the ability to focus, and the ability to enjoy things. I don’t want to do anything. I really just want to sit at home and sleep. Also, my habits are really fucked! I don’t really get hungry or tired, so I eat about 1 meal a day which my parents tell me to eat. Currently writing this post at 4:17 AM so I think that gives you an idea of my sleeping habits. Also, I can’t seem to feel any intimacy for other people? Then why am I so horny? Fucking hell	severe

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there’s nothing here for me."	severe
train_pid_8374	"What can you do? : A successful person cannot comprehend what it would be like to not even be able to get out of bed, to have horrible genetics, to have neck and shoulder pains, to not be able to get of bed, to have so little motivation that you can't get a glass of water, to have depression - you have an entirely different perspective because you have depression and others just aren't able to see that

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe

Im also paranoid 100% of the time, scared to meet certain people because I see them as a sign that I am ugly (yeah... apophenia, ocd and bdd causes me to think in that way, I cant explain, it sounds weird when you try to explain it). I do rituals to keep myself safe, im scared of a lot of things: people, height, sounds. I just feel so broken with all of those problems. Im lonely too, i only have my mom to talk to.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

train_pid_8387	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it.

I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe

It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with.

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery.

train_pid_8401	"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.

Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling.

I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety.

train_pid_8415	"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question “How often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?” 

Because in my depression I’ve definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don’t feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. 

Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! 

Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 

1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I’m low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let’s say I’m feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I’m not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, “You could use that to kill yourself.” The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, “No, you’re not going to do that. That’s stupid.”
2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren’t randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn’t reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I’m incredibly anxious, I’m convinced they hate me, and I’m also convinced I’m the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes “Okay, guess you should just kill yourself then.” But the rational part is like “NO YOU DON’T. THAT IS STUPID.” Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 
3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don’t have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 
4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you’re aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Which of those count as “thoughts of suicide” or whatever my doctor might ask? 

If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don’t want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don’t experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?

Chances are I wouldn’t be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say “no” if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don’t last terribly long for me. 

I live in Florida in case that matters.


Thank you so much!"	severe
train_pid_8416	Best antidepressant for major depressive disorder? : I’m currently on Adderall 30 mg twice a day and have been since 2014. I was on 20 mg total Prozac for my depression (started in late 2013) when I first started Adderall in 2014, but in January 2015 I decided Adderall would be enough to handle my depression and my ADHD, so I stopped taking Prozac. But now, years later, my depression has gotten worse and I really feel I need an antidepressant again to use in conjunction with my Adderall. I have tried Wellbutrin, but its too much with the Adderall.	severe

train_pid_8418	"why did i fail my suicide attempt : things could be so much better hadn’t my parents found me in a comma and taken me to get my stomach pumped. i was so close, i drank rat poison, took 800mg of lexapro, there was no chance i’d make it. I was so close to ending my suffering, my constant piercing pain. instead here i am full of hatred towards my body and being, aching with anxiety and fear of faillure and addicted to all sorts of substances. i have a dream and my very dream is nine months away, i’ve wanted to go to medschool ever since i can remember and i’m one interview away from accomplishing all i’ve ever wanted yet i can’t be bothered waiting another 3/4 of year nor do i know for sure that my childhood fantasy isn’t but an illusion that will never fullfill my inner emptiness. 

overall i just want to die, never waking up again seems so simple and desirable. Life is too complicated and i don’t wanna be part of it anymore. i hope i won’t fail my next attempt at ending my existence."	severe

train_pid_8421	I wanna give up and die. : Things are not going good for me at all. I failed my 9th grade English class last year because I could not make grades. Not because I am stupid or anything it was a lot on me since I was in honors. I kept it too myself and moved on with a new mindset and trying to pass my 9th grade class and my 10th. I missed 28 days of school because some days I don’t feel like getting up in the morning my grades are bad school is not my thing I hate doing things that are not going to help me in my future. You may call me lazy but I physically can’t get up I don’t know what I wanna be in life my grandma passed god has not helped me not once I don’t know. So I have been told I am going to fail 10th grade and I honestly wanna kill myself. This might not get a lot of attention but I wanna say I loved this world and honestly had some genuinely fun times. But I can’t move on.	severe
train_pid_8422	I could just end it.... : I could just kill myself and no one would know or care. I'm a burden to my friends and my family and now the only person I ever trusted to talk to about how I'm doing wants nothing to do with me anymore. I'm completely alone, worthless, and hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to make it through this year and no I won't see a therapist, I don't trust therapy and I never have, it's a waste of money. Mental health is not worth that much to me. Deep down I wish someone would commit an act of violence wherever I am at a given time and would kill me so I could spare my family knowing I'd killed myself. It's over, I have nothing.

train_pid_8426	How do I keep going? : Im diagnosed depression and i dont know how many more days I can handle the pain. I went through depression once when I was 15-17ish and now Im 21 and it came back again this October. The suicidal thoughts and the pain never goes away. I’ve attempted once in November but my friend saved me. I am trying me best seeing a psychiatrist, going through multiple antidepressants, have a good set of friends I can count on (I feel lucky as many dont have this) and parents who love me and actually go to a pretty good school. There is no one event that pinpoints my depression I guess I was just born broken. I feel depressed 24/7 and have “attacks” atleast once a day where its really intense to the point i can feel my heart in pain. Im just tired of living like this. I am trying everything i can but i dont see any light ahead of me. At this point its not if i will commit suicide but rather when. I think ill do it when i go back to uni after the holidays.	severe

train_pid_8435	"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety."	severe

I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  

Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. 

My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  

Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it.

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

You can have some fantasy about changing your life but all that will happen is you still being a random failure... so I start telling myself I just need to try very hard and very quickly come to the realization that if I have to try that hard, while it's not just that I'll probably have to put in more effort/luck/hard work/pain endurance than that but also that success is not close to guaranteed then why not just suicide?"	severe

train_pid_8456	This world is making me go insane : Its the first day of 2020 and i hope that everyone else sees the world in my perspective but i just cant take it anymore i know someone will disagree with me and proably downvote this post for having a different opinion but I’m just gonna say it when these HK protest started i didn’t care but when i heard of people getting hurt on both sides i started to act a little skeptical and concerned one day i posted a video of a chinese man getting set on fire on r/morbidlyreality and all i got was “this is fake” and “your just the ten cent army” and when i saw a picture of a protestor who got hit in the face with a gas canister everyone was supporting him and saying whoever did this were monsters and I’m like ok then so i can sucker punch an old man for having a different opinion but if he has your opinion then I’m the monster this revelation just changed everything its all “FREE HK” i see everywhere but never stopping and thinking “maybe my side has done bad things too” but when i say this I’m suddenly the dumbass who hates democracy all of you are just saying this because it looks cool and never think fuck all of you its making me insane i don’t know what to do all i hear is HK HK HK i just want it to stop i want people to just be kind to each other i don’t know  what to do anymore	severe
train_pid_8457	First day in 2020 and all.i want is to kill myself. : [removed]	severe
train_pid_8458	I feel tired of living, can't help but feel like I should be done with life by now and that I'm just dragging it. : [removed]	severe
train_pid_8459	"I feel like killing myself would be the only to make my existence meaningful : 1) I feel like an asshole for admitting this, but I know my family and friends would suffer and I want them to. I feel like it's the only way to make anyone FEEL anything, that I'll be permanently in their memories if I do that, and that I'm just an afterthought if I continue living.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff."	severe
train_pid_8460	I can’t life anymore : The frustration of being untethered to life, floating away and still failing at disappearing, is unmatched.	severe
train_pid_8461	I wish I wasn’t sober. : Today is one year sober. Over the past year I’ve had the occasional drink on special occasions, but other than that, my last high was last New Year’s Eve. I took one xanax. I miss it everyday. Not just xanax, but any drug. I was addicted to anything you would put in front of me, as long as it took me away from the world I was living in, but benzos were my DOC. I loved how just a few pills would allow me to talk to people, or just not give a shit about anything. Im starting my 4th semester of college, 3 failed classes so far. I dropped out of highschool and I’m what feels like impossibly far behind. Nothing at school interests me, I feel like I’m doing it just to appease my parents. When I picture where I’ll be in a few years, it’s dead. It’s been a while since I’ve had suicidal urges, and I don’t now, but I do have an urge to be dead. I know that once I finally completely give up on school I’ll be kicked out, and I’m not going to live my life paycheck to paycheck working fastfood jobs forever. I’d rather just let the streets take me like they almost once have. Not a single day has ever gone by since I quit, where I didn’t think about taking a xanax, snorting some oxy, railing a line of coke, or which new research chemical I was gonna score on next. Everyday I think about how much easier life would be if I threw away everything I’ve done to “better” my life. If I had all my drugs again, at least I wouldn’t care what was happening around me. It all feels so hopeless. I just want to feel the warm embrace of an opiate surround me while I’m barred out. It’s the only thing that brings me comfort, thinking about it. Funny how the worst time of my life, now seems like it was the best.	severe

I’m literally on my last leg...I fucked up my relationship with the man and I love which ruined New Year’s Eve and, this past day I’ve been so depressed and sick to my stomach yet I just wanted to drink again WHY DO I ALWAYS NEED A DRUG TO SUPPRESS MY NATURAL STATE WHY AM I FUCKED UP LIKE THIS I STG I HAD SO MANY THOUGHTS OF JUST ENDING IT IDK WHY IVE BEEN CURSED WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN MY FMILY IS NORMAL. I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I’m weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don’t understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn’t have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can’t stop myself from all the irrational thoughts"	severe

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with. The kind of people you hang out with all the time and are totally comfortable with.

train_pid_8474	I have nothing to look forward to for the new decade. : There is one thing though and that is for today (new years day) to be over. The holidays make me so miserable and so does winter. I know winter wont end soon but I'm so glad the holidays will. It's not just me. I see so many people actually miserable. Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb. I cant commit suicide because I guess that will be selfish of me but its selfish for everyone to force me to live in misery. I wish a drunk driver would have put me out of my suffering last night.	severe
train_pid_8475	"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.
Also english isnt my first language so if have messed up the grammar or something somewhere you know why"	severe

train_pid_8483	What it do, why is this. : So I’ve grown up with parents who were not a good pair. They fought a lot and screamed at each other my whole growing up. It came to the point my mom would leave tinge house and my dad wouldn’t let her. I would have to follow them outside and force my dad to stop holding the car door on my mom. Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what. It doesn’t affect me that bad and no one has noticed so it doesn’t affect me too bad. Thanks ✌🏼	severe

train_pid_8486	"Going in and out of happy and depressed. : I feel like this has always been a thing with me. A lot of days I'm just depressed the entire day, but most of them (especially recently) I seem to move in and out of short bursts of mania and depression. One minute I'll feel unstoppable in my quest to improve my mental health. I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind."	severe

train_pid_8489	"Any advice? : So... I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  
I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  
don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:

I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself.

 I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  
I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.

Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  
My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  
He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.

And then there's me.  
I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  
I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  
Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.

Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  
I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.  
Your thoughts will be appreciated."	severe

I just met someone that I actually fallen in love with. She has anxiety disorder, I think she's been through a hard time becuase of her scars and amount of ""close calls"" overdosing the pills.
