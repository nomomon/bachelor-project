i am scared this is it. i lie to myself every day and say i will make it out but i think this might just be it. i thought i wanted a girlfriend but i realize that what i really want is to feel loved. ive spent years on this earth but ive felt completely alone forever. my heart hurts. my subconscious taunts me every night only for me to wake up to the reality that i am a loser who is not worth anyones ti ame. i am scared i wi will live like this until the day i die. i am being torn from the inside but i am too much of coward to end it all. i am sorry	moderate
new to this but just wanted to vent i just finally realized that i am kind of in a bad mental state. there is this feeling of dread in me. i do not want to work so i made an excuse not to go to work. i kind of feel like all of this stem from being financially unstable where i am living pay check to pay check, hating my job because of the toxic environment i just had enough of it where i am feeling like i have to walk on eggshells around people and having people talk about me because i am not at their standard, school and trying to keep up with grades and i do not know. just thoughts of not being here console me. i just do not want to do anything at all i am kind of just sad. i do not know how to explain it. i hope someone can relate.	moderate
i am sad it is kinda always been an issue. i wouldn t say it is as bad as my peers but it is definitely bad. there is a lot that i obviously can not write cause it would take a while but i wi will just say the grand scheme of things. so basically i am not really happy. i have not been happy. it definitely started to get really bad last year but it was always an issue growing up. i was very emotional growing up and by the ti ame i was in th or th grade i had self esteem issues. there was not much of a reason why, i just did. i did not like myself. tbh i hated almost everything about myself until like middle of th th grade. i found a group of friends that i would hang out with everyday and everything felt authentic. like we always said shit how it was and got along great. we did lie about something or start some shit with each over someone else. like we just stuck by each other. it is hard to explain. but they all stopped talking to me. first, one of them ended up stopping talking to me because my friend. then the other friend just stopped wanting to hang out. it was not that he was not friends with us anymore, he just stayed inside all day. so it was just me and the other friend and he prioritizes school over a lot of things so basically i was alone. like yeah i could text people but it is not really enough. it is not very easy for my to make new friends. i am an introvert and honestly i am just awkward if i do not know you. this all happened in th grade. th grade was by far my worst year. my grandfather passed away. he was more of a father to me, as my dad was not really in my life for the first years. i found a girlfriend and she cheated on me. my grades were slacking causing more stress. i was alone. i had close friend. there was a lot of ti ames where i honestly wanted to ki will myself. i found another girlfriend. shes been great. we re very close. but i sti will feel depressed. i am in my senior year now. the whole reason why i started feeling this way was after february break. i had a lot of ti ame to myself and i was able to reflect. a lot of the nights i smoked weed just so i did not have to think because i knew it was not going to be well. every vacation, whether summer, holliday, april, february, whatever, i get really sad. i do not smoke when i have school or if i have to do something in the morning cause the mornings are hell. so i was thinking. i realized i am very dependent on people. i need social interaction in real life to stay happy. the issue is i am not able to get it. even when i do, i am someti ames sti will not happy. i just do not know what to do. about a month ago, me and my gf broke up. she was not happy. i was obviously sad about it, but i was finally going to get help for everything because as bad as it sounds, i know i need her. without her, i genuinely do not think i can live. she is pretty much all i have at this point i feel like. i would never tell her this, as i do not want her to feel trapped. i do not know what to do. i can not really bring myself to tell my mom about it. my sister was suicidal and it hurt my whole family. i just do not want her to feel bad. i do not want to be put on meds or something either, but i just do not know what to do. i stayed home from school yesterday and i want to again. i have no motivation. there is a lot more to it i just kinda wrote this up in a couple minutes. i probably forgot some i amportant stuff but the main issue is really this paragraph. i know i have some issue. i just do not know how to fix it, well more so i can not bring myself to tell anyone.	moderate
lonely but not alone. all of my i ammediately family members is dead. my dad died yrs ago and grandmother yrs ago. my mom months ago and grandfather a month ago. for six months, i was jobless and depressed. now i have a job working as a service technician and i love it. but sti will i have episodes where i feel lonely and depressed and i miss my family but i have my fiancee and her daughter. my depression comes and goes like crazy. and makes it worse that i am sti will living in my mom old house for right now. but i am so scared that when i do move out that it wi will not be stable to live for a long ti ame i am talking yrs and that bring on my anxiety and eventually a depression period. i do sti will have thoughts but they are rare now. not needing any replies just needed to vent.	moderate
this year has been trash. i dont know why i am posting here. i do not even know why i am talking about it at all. in my family if you talk about your problems then you re just attention seeking so i try not to. i guess i am just tired of keeping it all to myself. this year i left my year long abusive relationship. he raped me, he stalked me after we broke up, and harassed me relentlessly. i was scared to leave my own home. i was scared to even be in my own home. i was always worried that he would show up and i spent most of my ti ame with all of my doors locked and hiding behind the couch. i thought it would get better. then i developed some major health problems and lost my job because of it. i loved my job. a lot. it was such a huge escape for me and it was always so fun for me to do. i had to have surgery and during that surgery i was awake the entire procedure and ever since then it is made my mental health so much worse. the house i was trying to buy was sold, and now that i have no job who is going to sell me a house anyways? it is like every ti ame it starts looking up then it gets a mi willion ti ames worse. i do not even know what to do at this point. nothing is getting better. everything is getting worse than i can handle and it just keeps coming. i need a break. i need something. even if i just got my job back it would help i ammensely. i just want relief.	moderate
needed to yell into the void i am a pos. i am currently also physically sick and at home with my parents. my parents really want me to work during my break from uni. i want to but at the same ti ame i really do not. i am too scared to even make phone calls. my social anxiety has gotten no much worse since i stopped therapy. i can do some more things but for other things my anxiety is worse. i hate applying for jobs and the rejection everyti ame makes me feel so fucking shitty. if i could at least work from home it would make things easier. i do not have any ski wills to qualify for anything. i am sti will a uni student. i have been struggling with depression. i have thoughts about ki willing myself daily and i do not know how to ask for help. i have no friends because i thistanced myself from everyone. all of this is all my fault. i am stuck in a major i hate and i can not find a job. i am so useless. i am the biggest thisappointment. i can not stand looking at myself in a mirror. i try to stay thistracted but nothing is fun. i am just wasting my life away doing nothing all day. i do not deserve a life. i hate uni. i hate my life. if i just ki willed myself it would all be over. i am scared about what wi will happen if i do not succeed. i do not want my parents to get angry at me or blame themselves. i want to have a good life but i do not think i am even able to at this point. i can not stop being like this. i hate myself so much. i just want everything to stop.	moderate
i do not know why i am here anymore i feel like i am alive, solely to exist. there is no purpose to my life, i take no joy from activities, something is may dampen my feeling for a while but then they just come back stronger. i have not felt normal for a long ti ame, i forgot what normal is. i went from a confident young man with his whole life ahead of hi am, to someone i do not even recognise anymore. i have crippling self doubt, anxiety through the roof, any hobbies that used to give me pleasure just do not anymore. i hate being by myself because i have to listen to all the voices in my head. i am a shell of the man i once was. i do not know how much longer i can go on. i do not want to commit suicide because it would break my family, but i wish every day for some tragic, freak accident to happen and that ll just be it. i have a good family, good job, good friends, roof over my head and food in my fridge. i have no reason to feel like this, and yet i do. i have every minute of every day for the past years. you try and reach out for professional help but you just get passed off from one person to another, you re always someone else is problem. i do not know how much longer i can do this.	moderate
i dont want to be here anymore i dont want to die, i dont want to hurt myself, but i genuinely do not want to exist anymore. i wish i could just thisappear as if i was never here in the first place, i am so fucking useless and i dont know how to get myself out of this. i fantasize about someone just absolutely fucking wrecking me in a car accident or something but i dont want people to miss me or grieve for me so those thoughts make me feel so so guilty. the worst thing about it is the fact that i finally have the cutest lil dog ive wanted forever, am in a loving relationship, ive got okay family, i am about to get my bachelors, and i am only there is no thiscernible reason for me to feel so hopeless, burnt out, and just plain sad. i guess i am trying to say that i have a good chance for a pretty good life but my stupid fucking piece of shit brain wi will not let me do anything to get there. in theory, i know what i need to do to get out of this, the steps i got to take, but i literally wi will sit there and do what i know is fucking me up ti ame after ti ame, and here we are. i should be alseep since its am and i have so much shit to do tomorrow that ive put off for weeks, but instead i am wide awake and posting on here for whatever reason do i want attention??? advice?? do i want anything at all???? why dawg i feel like a waste of space and honestly, if i had the chance to just stop being here without causing pain to any of my loved ones, i would take it pronto bro. its been years of this and also what the fuck what the fuck what theee ffuuuuuuuuuuuuck	moderate

how should i explain to my mom about my mental health? can you guys help as to how should talk to my mom that i might have depression amp anxiety and need professional help. my mom is the nicest human amp i know she cares for me but i have never talked about my internal struggles with her so i am terrified how she wi will react or how my family wi will react or might even treat me differently afterwards. i might not be the most cheerful or happy go person but i portray a persona in front of my family. i pretend to be fine, laughing, a ti ames cracking jokes, helping my mom with few chores etc. i have been struggling so much for the past yrs. but dealt with it alone but i am going downhi will amp get suicidal thoughts. the main reason i never reached out is because i never struggled with any major that might lead me to feeling like this, a severe trauma or abuse. infact, i am privileged to have a loving, supportive amp an overprotective family, food, clothes,home, a nice education amp way easier life than my family or people. my family went through a lot of shit ,sti will do which might effect their mental health but they sort it out themselves amp never seek any special help. it makes me feel weak amp selfish for reaching out .someti ames feeling like i am faking it all. i feel like such a burden amp thisappointment to my family. a waste of space,resources, ti ame amp wish i could donate my life to someone. even though it is getting better but where i am from, mental i willness is sti will looked down upon amp is stigmatized. only mad or psychos seek professional help due to which people rarely ever reach out for help. i am exhausted of feeling like shit, of being scared of myself,of running away from my problems amp i want to do something about it.... thanks in advance for anyone replying or even reading instead of scrolling through. it is my first post here amp so means a lot. lastly, apologies for my lack of english ski wills not my native lang .	moderate

depressed international student studying in canada in august , i moved to canada. i was initially moving to canada with my ex girlfriend, but a family accident happened, and she had to stay back, ulti amately that resulted in a lot of stress for me. i am years old, and i am in the last high school year, and i feel like i can not make it. i have been warned by the board multiple ti ames because of my absences, and by teachers, most of them want me to succeed, and i can see that, but it is really hard. i had a motorcycle accident last december when i went back home for christmas, which resulted in a significan not injury in my leg, which resulted in more absences. i have paid a lot of money to move out, i moved out due to depression, but my depression is really hitting me, and i do not think i can hold it until june. i have explained in school most of my problems everyone knew about the motorcycle and a few teachers knew about my depression problems however, it is way worse than what they think. i am also a high grade student that is why they are so helpful, i guess too. i can not make my self get out of bed in the morning, and i am on the verge of getting kicked out of high school and the country since i am an international student. any legal help that can help me hold for a few more months?	moderate

weight gain due to depression let me rephrase that, i have gained weight solely due to my own unhealthy eating. i tend to eat when i am feeling particularly down, and i have felt that way for the last years or so. this has led to my putting on a whopping lbs in the last years. it upsets me because i hate how i look, which makes my depression worse. i grew up in a healthy household where my mum made nutritious meals for us. i make healthy meals at home for my husband and i, but the weight gain is due to my unhealthy snacking especially binging on potato chips and chocolate. i feel bad for my husband because he has to deal with this although he has never complained , plus our sex life has really taken a hit. i have never been this size before and it is really affecting me. i have started taking steps to help with that by li amiting the amounts of unhealthy food i eat and snacking on vegetables and fruit. i would appreciate any help with making that mental switch to not relying on food for happiness. thank you.	moderate
i think i am depressed. i am f , and i am empty. and at the same ti ame fi willed with fear and anxiety, and despair. i fake that i am ok, because it helps me to not sink deeper. i can not sleep until it is am, and then i want to sleep until my back hurts and i just can not lie down anymore. i fucked up my schedule, but i do not know if it is because i am lazy, or just dont want to start a new day no matter what, and prolong today, so tomorrow does not come. at least for a little bit longer. i have a great job and i love it. at least i loved it before, and now i just do it, because i do not want to lose it. it is the greatest place for me, the ideal place. and yet i struggle to get up and start working. i need to help my family, because i am the only one who can, and if i loose my job, we ll plumet down to poverty again. my brother steals money from me. he is a grown ass man, and desperate alcoholic. i hide my wallet from hi am, but he sti will manages to grab any penny left unnatended. he is unemployed and unmotivated. i can not just leave my home i tried. i can not leave my mother, and lonelyness makes everything ti ames worse. my dad says i should not cry because he stole a couple bucks. well, he should not just shrug it off, like nothing happened, but yet he does. i am an artist, but i do not make art. there is no point. i do not enjoy it as i did before. i do not enjoy video games, i do not enjoy books, movies, hobbies... i have a whole damn cupboard fi willed with materials to create something beautiful, and i feel they rot and turn to dust before i find the strength to use them. i feel like crying every ti ame something minor goes not as i wanted or expected. even if nothing goes wrong, i sti will worry and get teary, because i fear that it wi will. someti ames i look at the roof of the nearest tall building and wonder, how easy it is to get up there and just end it all. maybe the door is not locked. maybe i only have to make a few more steps and be at peace. i never even get close to this building. i do not want to upset my mom. she would not make it, if i am gone, and my family wi will go to ruins once again. and the worst thing, it is the only reason that keeps me breathing. the only friend i had would not talk to me, and i am afraid she was never my friend. for all of this years. i am a wreck. i am so sorry for myself, it is thisgusting. the therapist said it is not depression, it is just my personality. i guess being a sad sack of shit is normal then.	moderate

life is falling apart i do not know where to begin actually but i apologise for the poor grammer. life took an unexpected turn and a half years ago. had a stroke and lived to tell the tale. lost the use of my right hand and yes i am right handed. the first months after it was fine and i was just concentrating on getting home and being with my wife and well better as much i amproved as i could be. i would always thought that people saying they had depression was a bit of a roll your eyes moment but in severe cases i knew people had it bad. i know now that is not the case. my personality has changed and i am complete and utter dickhead now. i have lost friends. pushed family away. i am quick to anger and i keep upsetting the people that i love and love to be around. i am having trouble getting work but i know right now iits probably not the best place to be. but with the u.k being how it is at the moment i feel that i need to. i am struggling. i wouldn t have lost as many friends or pushed people away . i have hurt my wife. i am ruining my life at the moment. get help when you can. i need it now i am going to have to wait months until regular therapist appointments because the nhs is chronically underfunded. i should have got help sooner. i want to get better. be well everyone	moderate

i do not know i really hate being alone, but i hate being around people, i have no actual friends and can not make any new ones. i do not know what the fuck is wrong with me, i am so in and out of it at the same ti ame. i sti will laugh but i am not sure wether it is genuine or not. i have these ups and downs like a seesaw while sti will feeling completely miserable and completely forgotten. i cut to cope. i do not know how to describe it, but there is an utter sense of nothing that comes back and goes away and gets worse and gets monotone, it is never a complete up. people say that it gets better, but i really do not think it does. we exist, we be happy and be sad and a bunch of other emotions, then we die and everyone forgets us. and really, what is so bad about cutting? take away the social stigma around self mutilation, and really, it is just a way of healing yourself, mentally. i want to die and i can not find a bloody reason for it. my family wouldn t survive without me so i can not escape, not for decades, and if i could ki will myself and everyone would forget i existed, i would. there is truly nothing i am missing out on in life and i can not stand to face the fact that i do not have control over anything in my life, not even my death. i really just want to go away. if you re going to tell me that self harm and suicide is not the answer, i am well aware and i have heard it multiple ti ames, but what is the reason that it is not? is there even one at all? i really wish i was dead. i wish i never really existed at all.	moderate

i really need some help. any advice is really appreciated. quite a story here. i am originally from ohio from a really religious family. after going to college, i became an atheist and my family basically stopped really caring what happened in my life and who i was. to make matters worse, i was always so religiously sheltered growing up that i never really made many if any close friends. well, a lot of things in life wound up with me moving to colorado a few years back. i met a girl i really liked. she had dogs and lived with her family. she invited me to move in with them, so i did and paid her parents each week. they talked me into getting a dog, which i did about months in to the relationship. i fell completely in love with the dog mira and the family. well, about . years into the relationship, she broke up with me really, out of nowhere. i thought we were happy . at the same ti ame, a seasonal job i had was just ending. also, they were my home. so, i found myself with no friends, no adopted family, no job, no girlfriend... everything was gone. but, at least i had my dog. i tried to make things work, somehow, for about months. but... my dog is really nervous and i can not take her to dog day cares. i also can not afford dog walkers for her, let alone even afford my own place that allows dogs. but i am also extremely guilty when leaving her along hours each day for work... like it ki wills me. she is a lab, and is very attached and used to having many dogs, a backyard with a dog door, family coming and going... the works. i could tell that with me she was very depressed. so i moved to ohio, where things are a little cheaper, so maybe i might make things work. as soon as i got back with mira, i came to the realization that my family was unwi willing to help me or my dog. i did not have a place to stay, and i did not have a job so i had no way of finding housing. i was living in my car with the dog. after a few weeks of this i had to give up. i could not just give my dog to a shelter, so i drove all the way back to colorado to drop her off with my exes family in secret... and they told me they were going to get rid of her if i did not come back to get her. i came back to ohio without mira... and have been realizing there is just nothing here for me. i have a family that just does not care about me, and no job prospects in my field outdoor recreation . my friends have all moved on from when i was last in ohio... nobody is reaching out or attempting to see me. i feel so absolutely alone, and now... now i do not have my dog, even. i reached out to my family that i was feeling extremely depressed maybe suicidal for help.. and they told me that they did not want me around because i was scaring them . that hurt so amazingly bad. so, i am feeling extremely alone and depressed right now. i do not really know what the right thing to do is when i have my dog, i feel so overwhelmed guilty leaving her, but i can not really take her to day cares. but without her, i feel truly stunningly alone. and if i do not go back to colorado soon and get her... i wi will lose her forever. i feel extremely depressed, but i do not see a solution or a way out of this. does anyone have any kind of ideas for me? i need help so badly right now.	moderate
i lost my appetite it is crazy how bad it can get so quickly. a couple days ago i was fine and then one bad event can send me into a tailspin of anxiety and harm. i feel absolutely empty because i hurt the feelings of a bully friend by calling out their bad behavior. i know they are probably fine considering they are hanging with some other friends tonight and went out to a bar last night. i instead have barely eaten the past few days and last night i just stayed in bed after work staring at my ceiling. the fact is that this is the perfect example of me hiding my mental health for preserving friend group peace and remaining outwardly strong towards others. they accidentally found out that i did not like them and then have been playing martyr. inside i am crumbling and i am too ashamed to admit my out of proportion reaction is not my fault and let my friends know just how physically upset i am. i feel like such a burden with my mental health during ti ames like these. i am sorry i can not be better.	moderate
i can not see beauty anymore i know that there is beauty in life, the ti ame you spend with your loved ones, the precious moment when you re able to see a rainbow when it is raining, the countless breaths we take on a daily basis that miraciulously keep us alive and so much more. with my cognition i know that there is beauty out there, but right now it just feels as if i have lost the ability to truly recognize and feel it, as if i have got some type of colourblindness. it hurts so much more because i know that i was once able to truly see it, so i am also aching because i am mourning over something i have once had. the only thing left is hope, that i wi will be able to get out of this again, like the ti ames before, but everyti ame that hope decreases. honestly, i do not have a significan not point to make, i just felt the urge to share my thoughts in the hopes that the people on here may be able to relate.	moderate
just broke up with girlfriend few nights ago and i have been taking it really hard. it is hard again to find motivation for anything this is a right person, wrong place type of situation, if that is even a thing. i really care, love and adore this girl but her mental problems were too big of a handful for me, especially since i already have a hard enough ti ame dealing with my own mental problems. she tried committing suicide a few weeks back and that moment was incredibly stressful and haunting for me. i felt like since that if we were to stay together, it would happen to her again at some point and i could not handle that, and if we broke up it would happen again right then and there. i felt trapped. this has been a lot on my mind and i feel bad for not being able to stand by her anymore while she fights her demons, i am sti will fighting my own and i feel like i can not win my fight if i stay with her. i have worked too hard for far too long to make the progress i have made as far as my mental health goes. i used to be in and out of the behavioral hospital since an early age, and lately i have been going to the gym, getting plenty of sunlight, meditating, literally doing anything i can that i believe wi will make me feel better. since we have broken up i thought i would be i ammediately able to jump back into this and return to the goal orientated, overachiever i know i can be but instead i just feel grief, loneliness, regret and shame. it is hard for me to get out of bed and get these things done. work is the only thing that is keeping me going right now, but as soon as that ends, i am just back in bed with no motivation. i have not been able to eat and i am already underweight so i feel like it is taking its toll on me. all i want to do is sleep and shut out existence. when you feel like you have hit rock bottom again, what is something you do to get your motivation back?	moderate

is there any hope? any help? it sure does not feel like it. it feels like there is no comfort or help anywhere for the pain and stress that have become constants in my life and driven me near the edge. lately i have been hit with a deluge of, to put it mildly, unpleasant life events, and i am left wondering how much more i can be expected to take. i try to find some comfort in cultivating a balanced life, but nothing seems to help. either that, or i stumble across something that makes everything worse. a nice evening with friends leads me right back to the crushing death spiral of depression as soon as i arrive back home to my empty flat. my work, which used to bring me pleasure or at least some measure of purpose, now feels like an insurmountable obstacle that i often can not even bring myself to face until the last minute in some case, after the last minute . my most recent romantic dalliance since my unwanted divorce, in which he offered me flowery promises of love and a life together, ended in heartbreak before it truly began. therapy is a temporary bandaid that prematurely gets ripped off between appointments, leaving me picking at the scabs until next ti ame. and inpatient treatment? so i can be subjected to some superficial group therapy meetings at best and doped up on antipsychotics at worst, all while being treated as a prisoner? forget it. so where can i realistically turn? it is a total cliche to say no one gets it, but it is true. no one who has not felt this way gets it. they can sympathize and try their best to understand the pain and the helplessness, but it is not something they can truly grasp. i am not particularly religious. in my mind as well as my heart i si amply can not believe in god or an afterlife since it just does not make sense to me. i dearly wish i could because the people i know who do so seem so happy, fulfi willed, and hopeful. i do, however, try to find some small comfort in the rituals and prayers i grew up with, and i can not stop myself from crying out to the universe or some god to deliver me from this hell in which i have found myself. not necessarily through death, but something has to give. coupled with the constant, overbearing weight of depression, this onslaught of pain has just become entirely too much to bear. they say real help comes from within, but what if there is nothing inside? i have nothing to give, to myself or to this world. so what can i even do? if it truly all comes down to me, i am doomed.	moderate

i would never say this out loud, but i just want to get it out. i see pictures of the people i went to school with on social media with their friends, not exactly livin their best life or whatever, but just hanging out, doing nothing. i have never had someone i could just do nothing with. i have never had a best friend not even a close friend for that matter. it is not like i pushed people away, it just sorta happened. i became the one everyone completely forgot about and i do not even know when or how. maybe it is just me, maybe all i can give are a few laughs and a hug and be forgotten forever. i just wish, just once i was someone is favourite person or at least have a few friends i could talk with. i am not even on any group chats on any social media, that is how bad it is. my anxiety does not help either, right now i am writing this on my notes app and i am not even sure if i wi will post this. can you i amagine? having anxiety so bad that you can not even post something on a site like reddit? i am not looking for attention or anything, i am just venting out. i had to get this out. it was getting crowded in here. i am going to be posting this on a few subs, coz i am not sure where this fits, so if you come across this more than once, hello again! thank you for listening.	moderate
do i deserve to feel unhappy when there are starving children? throwaway, and i have posted this in a different subreddit as i would like a wide range of opinions. this has been a thought of mine for a while and has stopped me from speaking to someone about my mental state. while with a group of friends none know i am depressed one said how can people be depressed when they have got money, phones and food etc that was a few years ago. ever since then, whenever i get these awful feelings i think back to what he said. how can i be wanting to die and hating life when i have money to buy food every day, electronics and a loving family? i am sorry if this sounds dramatic or sounds like i am looking for attention, i have never truly opened up to anyone before for fear of getting called gay or a pussy by my male friendship group. i just need anonymous opinions.	moderate

help i need some advice i do not know, i am not depressed, i do not think so, i am not professionally diagnosed and i do not want to self diagnose myself. i just need some advice. i am a female in high school secondary school, and a closeted bisexual. i have been feeling unmotivated in school, rarely ever having the motivation to do homework or get out of bed to go to school. i noticed that i often used to over share so now, i rarely talk about myself to anyone, leaving myself to make a rant twitter account. if anybody asks me about my day, i say as little as possible to stop myself from being annoying by over sharing and quickly change the topic to them. then again, i am not used to anyone asking me anything. people often talk about themselves around me, i just listen. if they have problems, i listen and help. but someti ames, i just want someone to talk to as well. everybody around me is ticked off easily so i just let them do what they want i guess? when i say i have no one to talk to, i have and o o and e. and coming out, yes. i am a somewhat closeted bi. i am closeted to my family. i am scared of coming out, i do not know what the outcome wi will be. i live in a country where the lgbtq is not widely accepted, so it is kinda hard, i do not know. i have a girlfriend too, but someti ames, i get the feeling that she just does not love me? it is almost one sided. i have just been feeling so down and unmotivated. i someti ames even think suicide, which is really stupid, but i am sure i am just being really unconsciously dramatic about it. i have so much more built up but this is all i wi will share as i do not want to bore you with my stupid problems. i would really appreciate some advice right now, i am so lost.	moderate

it is not worth it. i think about life a lot. it is hard not to think about it while ai amlessly scrolling through facebook and reacting to posts that i did not actually like because i just wanted to please whoever shared them, walking down the street surrounded by people uncomfortably staring at me, sitting in class surrounded by so called friends of mine who openly and honestly love each other but can never really bring themselves to accept me, looking at my crush who does not even know i exist and is instead looking adoringly at someone else, letting out a frustrated sigh whenever anyone talks on the group chat and people start spamming it with a hundred messages a minute, and so on and so forth. so many painful reminders that i am supposed to be living, supposed to be existing just like everyone else, that, instead, i am just unnatural . i try to force myself to feel anything. to care about what people my age usually care about. a social life, a partner, a well paying job, a party where i could fuck some stranger and forget about them in the morning, a popular song, an instagram account with a thousand followers, but i can not care about anything or anyone anymore. nothing brings me happiness, sadness, or any of those normal feelings. all i feel is emptiness and anger for reasons i do not even know myself. i can not connect with people, and i always lose focus whenever someone is talking to me. i feel so alone in a noisy lecture room, and nobody stops to look at me once unless they do not have anyone else to whine and gush to. suddenly, i become the most i amportant person in the world just because i am conveniently there at the right place at the right ti ame to be used as a punching bag. i watch sappy romantic movies from ti ame to ti ame, and listen to love songs from various decades often. someti ames i wonder to myself wi will someone ever feel this way about me? wi will someone ever hold me in their arms and tell me there is nowhere else they would rather be but here with me? my parents are the only two people in the world who ever loved me. what happens when they die? who else wi will love me and genuinely give a shit about me, ask whether i ate today or drank any water or changed out of my clothes? myself? i fucking hate myself. there is no one else i would rather see dead but me. so who else? nobody, that is who. i might as well accept this fact right now so i do not get too shocked and upset when i find myself an old, withering human being dying alone in my cold bed. i am alone in this world. i do not feel anything. i have become so apathetic that i just want to drop out of college, pack my bags and thisappear forever if i do not ki will myself first. i do not know why i sti will wake up in the morning, i do not know why i bother. it is not worth living for, this pathetic life of mine. it is. not. worth. it. 	moderate

it is my first ti ame here but i am afraid i am back where i started. my depression is a really long story. it originates from being the third girl the first two were always best friends and there was not ti ame for me in the family with parents that thought i was fine and just cried a lot. and then the bullying in middle school for my race and the outcasting from my age group in church. then my in laws who trying to convince me to get over my pregnancy losses right after they happened. but now i have an month old son that i do everything i can do for and bring lights into my world. i thought everything would be good because i had something to live for. however, i am expecting my second and trying to get a career at home going, and i feel just as depressed as before i became a mom. i never wanted to be back here. i thought i beat it. but i am here crying because i feel like i do not matter. even though i am expecting a child, no one asks how it is going. no one tries to make sure we re okay, no one asks about the exciting details even though they were excited before. i try to get my mind off of it by continuing my youtube videos because it is become my passion. but i want to share my passion and yet the fact that i share my content and no one subscribes makes me feel so i amportant. i know subs do not happen right away but it is the fact that i work hard and it is thisney! and trying to hard to put in the effort for something i really care about and no one cares. no one cares. it is ki willing me. i feel like my own doctor does not care and she used to treat me like we were actually friends. everyone i think of in my life that should know what is going on with my depression, i know wi will downplay what i am feeling or just say to pray it out and i wi will feel better. it would not make me feel better. i want someone to understand that. i do not know how to feel like i matter again. i hate thinking that the world wouldn t change if i died but it is feeling normal again. i am starting to not care about gaining weight again and i was gaining a good amount before i was proud of it but literally no one else was i am underweight . i do not know what to think anymore. i do not want to give in to my depression again but i am breaking and i do not know when it is too late.	moderate
just call me ti willicum i have a great job. i have been here years. the pay is really good, my bosses and co workers are kind and appreciative, our clientele for the most part, are amazing... and i spend the majority of my morning commute wishing i would get into a hideous car accident so that i do not have to go in today. the thing is, while it is a great job a d i am lucky to have it, it is also pointless, repetitive meaningless work with no upward mobility, i am front staff and the one with seniority. everyday when i leave, i am no further ahead life than when i walked in in the morning.. years ago. sure it helped me get a car, pay me rent, help my family, get my dog,... the hours are long, i am working most weekends, makes it really hard to socialize.. i feel like that orca who went crazy in his tank and started murdering his trainers. you swi am circles long enough, anyone wi will go crazy. i do not know if it is just the depression talking, or maybe i wi will get over it. maybe it is stupid to quit why would it be any different at another job? it would also be kind of a dirtbag move, one co worker is out with cancer right now. it is been stressful for everyone. i have been training the new temporary girl for th last month, and that is even more stress. do i have the right to add to that stress? i do not know what to do any more...	moderate

last night on earth this ti ame i dont have any hope for tomorrow since the very first ti ame i first started to understand people, friends, life, i have had this fear that my life would end in a suicide. whether it was class th my first failed relationship, a ti ame following which for two years i could not think of anything but jumping off the first floor of my house. i have played the scene in the back of my mind for so many ti ames that i know exactly how much second it would take, the leaves i wi will be touching on my way down or the exact set of stones i would have my head banged against. it was also then i almost gave the idea of finding a person who would trust me with all their self and confide in me their truest and purest version. but it happened i did find love and i did find a person who loved me all their heart. at this ti ame, those years, i felt less suicidal than ever. it was an era of dreams, having passions. but, even it wasnt as crystal perfect as it sounds, nothing is. i somehow knew that even this would end, i can not be that lucky. and end it did after exactly summers. i again became back to having suicidal thoughts, this ti ame it was mostly dreams of being drowned in lakes, oceans, anywhere with water. it took a month i again fell in love and this person knew whatever i was going through better than anyone and stayed so for the next three winters. i had suicidal thoughts here and there but the person was really nice to many and kept care of my dark days. even with this i knew at the back of my head that this could end as i kept breaking her spirit unciouscly, now that today she is gone i have no more reason to live, no more reasons to evade suicidal thoughts. this ti ame i have medicines and repallants in mind, but whats different this ti ame is that this ti ame i dont have any hope for tomorrow any inhibitions that have otherwise kept me from taking this step. i have never been so low professionally to make matters worse.	moderate

i hope i can post this here. my wife has severe depression. and it is effecting both of our lives very heavily. what can i do to help? so. let me just say i have been around this my whole life. my mother had severe depression. and other mental health issues. i also developed a little bit of depression in my high school years. which was due to my father and stepmother who were drug addicted narcissist. since graduating and moving away i have been so positive and had a great look on life. but .. my wife has got it and she is got it bad. we met when we were both depressed in high school about our family situations. so when we graduated. we jumped in my car and left. moved miles away. lived with family and were having much more fun. she was sti will slightly depressed then. but she was a lot happier. the turning point was when we got pregnant with our daughter. we both always wanted kids. we wanted the family life so we could have our own family and raise our kids better than our parents did us. but.. that all changed when it actually happened. my wife begged to have a baby young. i was a little reluctant because i knew the price that is paid. i grew up raising my siblings think fiona in shameless . i knew what it was like to care for others every single need. and i warned her of this. but of course i wanted a family too. so we agreed and it happened. that is when everything went south. litterally. we moved back south near her family. and had our daughter. the entire pregnancy was a depressed nightmare for my wife. she was stuck home while i worked full ti ame. and she resented me for it. i even changed jobs to try and work night shift so i was home during the day and she had the car we had. that did not work. she would keep me up all day and not let me sleep. i was running on hours of sleep a day. for months. then our daughter was born and she was overwhelmed. she never experienced adult life and instead of taking it head on. she shied away. and relied heavily on me to take care of all the adult stuff. i worked, cooked, cleaned, made dr appts, went to dr appts, came home early from work if there was any issues. i had to stop suicide attempts multiple ti ames. ive had to fight knives away from her multiple ti ames. i ended up losing my job that year because of it. after that we bounced around job to job. house to house. like crazy. and now. we re restarting all over again. we found a very cheap house to rent. i am at a new job. things have finally settled down again since our daughter was born. but. the depression is sti will there. she is better in the sense that she is better at talking to people. she is not so afraid to make phone calls anymore. and go to the doctor alone. she is sti will afraid to drive long thistances though. and she sti will has no friends. so she sits at home while i work. and she just gets depressed over and over again every single day. then when i get home i have to scramble to pick up the pieces. if you step back and look at our life. we should be happy. we have a place. a beautiful daughter. a dog. cars now! there is food, tv, netflix. we have a yard. we live close by to some good shopping and parks. we are doing great for a couple year olds. but she does not see it. she sees all her old friends on instagram and facebook living the college life. having fun sti will like in high school. and she gets hateful of her own life and her own circumstances. she wants friends, and money, and a job. but she doesnt have any of those. and she gets super depressed about it. and she turns that anger towards me when i am home. and takes out her anger on me like it is my fault. saying if she never met me she would be happy and be having fun. i told her. she has her own car now. please go out and do something during the day to keep her mind out of the gutters. go out and meet people! go see an old friend! do something. but all she has for me are excuses. of why she can not or how she is afraid to. i just want to figure out how to help her. she refused medication. she does not like it. also she is horrible at remembering to take it. what can i do? cause we should be enjoying life right now. but instead it is like i have the whole world on my shoulders. and she is just trying to jump out the window of a moving train on a daily basis. what can i do for her? please. any advice is appreciated. thank you for reading	moderate

i have not been doing good at all last semester college i failed three classes, partially due to i willness. i know this wasnt my fault but this semester, my anxiety and depression have me terrified of everything and every little mark it has also had me sick, and scared to go to class. this basically means that i can be in one of three states . overly energetic normally this is right after i get a mark, but can be just a good day. i often am somewhat productive, but have a bad habit of putting things off as i feel like i have all the ti ame in the world like this. . extream anxiety this normally happens as i try to do something, mainly bigger projects that i think i have a handle on then suddenly dont or remembering my struggle in one class. . i want to cry myself to sleep i get so exaughsted and mucky minded i just want to sleep for the rest of ti ame. i doubt want everything to end, i just want to sleep forever. i can hardly do anything in this state and what i do is slow and tedious. i know i have anxiety and depression, and i kno part of why i have been like this. my aunt can be a bitch. she basically said that it was because i missed class and gets it in my mind that i have to constantly been in class for any good grades. so that combined with my already low tolerance for knowing when i should talk to someone, my inability to open up to people, my slight thistrust of the mental health capabilities of my curent location its canada but i have had issues, mainly with being brushed off and my need for good grades, i hav really been struggling with my mental health. and it is not just my mental health, its physical. i think i have something of a bug but i can not bring myself to do anything about it. like above i need to be in class, i can not afford to miss any class. i know it is bad, but i can not breack it. i just, i hate it. i hate my curent health level and it scares me. i have been in a state of anxiety recently and just can not breack it. sorry if this dosnt belong here i just. i didnt know where elce to put it.	moderate
i do not know what to do this all started when i moved away from my kids to go from by for a better job it is been all down hi will from there me and my wife moved from vermont where my kids and ex are to florida where me and my have had a child. everything was fine until the promotion was too much stress and draining me of my wi will to live so i quit and kept bouncing around ti will i landed back at my original point of employment minus the promotion. it is i amportant to mention at this ti ame i had an emotional affair with a co worker which i now regret to the fullest extent and honestly might be a big part of why my depression is getting so bad. i never said i was a saint in life. had to start all over so naturally bi wills started piling up. that was when we found out we were having a baby. in all the excitement it let me forget about everything that was slowly turning upside down in my life. a year and a half later my oldest sister gave me the christmas gift of paying a retainer for a lawyer so me and my wife could file bankruptcy and start over. things were good again i was back in a management position at a large retailer again making ok money. then after the bankruptcy i was told to step down due to performance at work so my income went down again but this ti ame i got a second job. never saw my family much but i was paying the bi wills so to me it felt alright. but then i got involved in a child custody case with my ex due to her drug use and thisappearing on the kids for a week while they were her ex is mother. that lasted about five months and ended up losing the case mostly due to me living so far away and that i had not seen my kids that much since i had left even though i kept strong communication with them. so i lost. all through the he court process i lost an uncle to cancer and also found out my estranged father was dying. i had not talked to because i shut hi am out of my life with no real reason besides that my mom really was bothered by hi am and me having any kind of relationship. things started looking up when i got another chance to move up at work but that ulti amately did not work out and i have had to step down once again. now we re struggling financially and emotionally and i feel like i am to blame for everything because i am. it is my fault that we re in this mess again, it is my fault we re getting behind on bi wills again, i constantly fight with my wife and they always consist of her saying she wants a divorce because she is miserable. i do not know what to do. i am toxic to everyone around me and i mess up everything. i am a failure in everything i do. i destroy everything i am apart of. i do not want to feel like this anymore. i someti ames wish that i would just have an accident or something so i do not have to keep letting everyone i love down and driving my wife who i love so so much away. i do not do anything i only leave the house for work and that is it. i am a type diabetic and i have not seen a doctor in almost two years. i do not want to die but someti ames i feel like that is the only way things wi will get better. this life is shit and i hate it	moderate

my entire life is crumbling apart this is a long post, with a shit ton of back story and references to trauma, abuse, infidelity, substance abuse, suicide. my life has steadily been collapsing since i met my abuser in . i stayed with hi am for three years, through severe financial, sexual, mental, and physical abuse. he just absolutely destroyed my ability to trust, my sense of safety, and devastated my relationships with my friends and family by isolating me and thisrespecting them. when i left in , i petitioned for and was granted a protective order for the maxi amum term allowed by law years. i have had vivid night terrors since i left that typically involve my abuser getting into my home, or slaughtering someone i love. i started seeing a therapist and was diagnosed with c ptsd, mdd, and panic thisorder. in end of , i began dating a guy we ll call sam. sam seemed super kind, caring, just an overall great person. we d known each other since , but our relationship sti will felt new and exciting! unfortunately, i found out in october that sam had cheated on me several ti ames over the years we d dated by then. he slept with someone else several ti ames, had nudes of another woman, and emotionally cheated with a third that we ll call sarah. sam would text sarah every day all day. he would ask her to dinner, take her to coffee, he took her to a wedding. drove her everywhere. introduced her to his son, even. constantly compli amented her body, and would refer to her as pretty girl every day. i was upset about the woman he would slept with, but his relationship with sarah was devastating. he promised not to see her or talk to her anymore, but i found out through mutual friends that they were sti will hanging out. she and i ended up in a confrontation over text, in which she said very hateful things about my relationship, which felt like she would heard from sam. she continually messaged me dogging on me and my relationship until i blocked her shortly after xmas. things were okay for a few weeks. fast forward to end of january. one of my very close friends committed suicide. this was overwhelming, especially because he would reached out to me two days before it happened, and i told hi am i was too depressed to really talk. when i went home for the funeral, i stayed with sam. he received emails from sarah that someone was harassing her online, and she believed it was me. it culminated on the day of my friend is funeral that sarah showed up to sam is with her father no we are not teenagers, she is and lives with her parents . she demanded that i speak to her, yelled at me, called me obscene names, and begged me to hit her so she could have my ass thrown in jail . i was already drunk on two bottles of wine, and in no state to handle anything, so i just kept repeating that she needed to leave and i had no interest in talking to her. sam took her side and told her she didnt have to leave. she then asked me if we we re even dating. when i said we had been for two years, she freaked out on sam. apparently, he would told her that i was a stalker, he didnt really know me, and i was only at his house because he was afraid id ki will myself. she left after blowing up on hi am, and he just went back to working on his computer in the next room. part of me feels like he is the one that messaged her online and created the entire blowup. i was absolutely devastated. my friend is suicide, my relationship with sam, sarah is outbursts. it was too much. i took a box cutter off the shelf and sliced open my arm, then downed the rest of my citalopram. pi wills of mg since that night, i have halfway broken things off with sam. even though we sti will talk and hang out and everything. i feel like i am just stuck in another cycle and i am ashamed and just feel pathetic for allowing hi am to stick around. i drink bottles of wine or most of a bottle of vodka each night. i dont eat. i sti will can not sleep because of night terrors. i can not afford therapy anymore so i just switched my meds to see if that helps. my entire life feels pointless and painful and i am honestly just exhausted by everything. i have no idea how to move forward or if i even want to. idk. i do not really even know if i want advice or to just be able to admit that i want to die without being locked away in a hospital and losing my job while sti will feeling fucking awful.	moderate

a rant i feel really guilty for posting on here because i feel that i do not have a reason to be feel like this, but i really need to just put down my thoughts. anyway, let me just describe my situation. my family is in the middle class, so i have always had a comfortable life. i have always gotten good grades at school, though i had to skip st and nd grade due to certain circumstances. currently in high school, with my favorite areas of study being math. i was involved in combat sports, which i enjoyed and participated in competitions. i started playing piano about years ago, though i have quit a lot along the way and i have not made much progress. i also enjoyed singing, though i never had a coach. so, probably seems like a pretty perfect life? happy family, only child, a model student, etc. yeah, i try to think so too. but i feel weird, i feel as if i am not good at anything. i am stupid, ugly, untalented, mediocre, etc. i hate myself. i hate my looks. i try to continue my old hobbies, but i feel that i am never going to be great. i want to do math as a career but i am demolished by my own thoughts that state that i wi will never be remembered and that i wi will live my life in vain. i have looked at high places and wondered what would happen if i was gone, if anybody would care or notice. i have come close to s h . i was thinking of doing pro sports, but then i remembered that there are so many people who are younger than me and are more set to get olympic goal than i wi will ever be. i want to sing, play the piano, make music for many to hear,but then i hear my voice and that idea goes down the drain. i feel like because i am the only child that i will thisappoint my parents. i do not know what to think or how to describe it, but that is my attempt. i hope you guys wi will understand. thank you, and i guess goodbye.	moderate
i do not see any point being here. i am not going to ki will myself, so do not worry about that. it is just that i do not see any point in me existing. whenever i look at my peers, they are always happy, have an abundance of friends with them and have this aura of confidence and charisma that attracts anyone. for me, it is the direct opposite i have a li amited amount of friends or acquaintances more likely , i do not feel happy most of the ti ame and have charisma. granted, i am watching videos on how to gain charisma and be more likeable but the progress of it is very gradual. and added with my family and the dynamics of it being fucked up, slogging through college for a degree that i both do not want and not good at even if i eventually cared about it and not feeling happy, i should not be here. i honestly feel that i am taking someone is space in college and they would be better privileged to have it rather than me. it is something that i had on my mind for a while and wanted to put it out there somewhere. even if it sounds bad grammatically or something like that, i just wanted to get it off my chest.	moderate

when your death wish becomes collective like, i wouldnt mind being exposed to corona or virus i seem to have walked an extra mile in my depressed mindset when i suddenly dont mind if corona virus evolves into a pandemic, or wishing that the walking dead wi will become non fiction. of course these thoughts are as selfish as all other depressed thoughts, forgetting the family members or friends and classmates and only i amagining one self in a dystopia or apocalyptic world. this is edgy af, and very emo. however, i can not help but think of this as a si amplistic view of life, and i find the scenarios to be a greater alternative in which nothing pressures you, and you kind of live with one si ample purpose surviving. now this leaves me insensible to the crucial situations and the worry of the people i know. it is bad but its comforting to think about.	moderate

my life is the best it is been in years, but i have never been this miserable. title says it all. it makes no sense. my life is great. i am more social and am having relationships with family and friends online i did not before. i have a cat i just love like a child. but despite all this i have never been so miserable in my life. i have been unhappy since i was , but i have never been this depressed ever. even though my life on paper is the best it is been in a long ti ame. when i am all alone be all think about it how much i have an aversion life. i just can not stand working. being miserable hours a week for the next years, just to live, sounds like hell to me. i think i am just tired of living. i am not suicidal, but i just want to die. i just personally have no desire to live. it is just an annoyance to me. i do not want to deal with it.	moderate

what to i need to do to live an happier life ? sorry, it is a bit long to read i am and do not really know what to do with myself since a long ti ame. it seems like happiness is not part of my life and i force myself to smile whenever i need to, but once i turn my head, every thing fades away and i am back being sad. i first thought this was going to last for some ti ame, you know when you re a teenager everything seems bad, but it is lasting something like a year. but speaking about me, i think that it never actually started because it was always like that. i remember when i was something around , my mother told me why do not you ever smile ? this stuck with me, knowing that my mother is really supportive and really want me to be happy. i keep bringing myself down every ti ame for any thing i do. it is like i can not be satisfied with something i make or think. i am not strong enough to talk about that to someone. i do not know why, but i just can not explain my feelings to somebody else. perhaps i am afraid to embarrass them ? but in the same ti ame, i hope someone goes through the mask i wear every day, and understand my true feelings... but for now, i do not know what to do any more. now my only hope is that maybe ti ame wi will solve everything and it wi will just be a bad memory. it may not be the good subreddit for my problems, because there are so many people suffering things that are way worse than me... thanks for reading after all.	moderate

i want people to know i am dying inside, but i also do not. what do i do? i am very shy, awkward, lonely, a closet homosexual, and very private about my feelings. school is awful, i am dumb, i always have so much homework, and it makes me not want to live. i find little enjoyment in anything anymore, i am not good at anything, nobody knows i am gay and it ki wills me to keep it secret from everyone i know. i can not even cry anymore because i have just grown so numb to these feelings for so many years. the two friends i have are both very busy people with their own lives and activities, and i can not stand the thought of being a burden to them by expressing a vulnerable side to them when i know full well they do not care enough about me to do the same about their problems.	moderate

long depressed post i know you guys must be tired hearing these types of rant over and over again. but if you can please read the whole. i am m, currently doing phd. i wi will be out of fellowship next month and it is sti will a year before i finish my phd. i have been suicidal in my school days, tried once but no one knows. i have these thoughts again and again when i see my future going no where. i have a huge stage phobia of addressing any gathering or even having anyone is attention on me. this thing is hurting me most as in my phd and in future i have to address audience students as i want to be a professor and i really enjoy explaining things to other but only one on one or to a small familiar non judgemental audience. everyti ame before my half early phd presentation i get in to a depressed stage and i feel like i run somewhere and be in isolation. before my first phd presentation i was under huge mental stress and it got me diabetes insipidus i think it was due to stress . i do not like sharing these thoughts with anyone and it is the first ti ame i am sharing it to anyone. i think sharing this wi will not help me and people wi will just pretend they care but no one actually cares. i think i do not have the capability to survive financially or emotionally. i like being alone, living alone. on personal front i have a girlfriend and our marriage is fixed later in this year. we have been together since years but i feel i am ruining her life too. she is very confident, well spoken in front of anyone but she is stuck with me. the reason why i do not share these thoughts is because i have done nothing to solve these issue. i am a lazy person and just want to lay in bed surfing net playing games. i know i can be better but i do not make any effort. also i am not brave enough for a suicide and i just wish someday i vanish from this world or better vanish from everyone is life like i never existed.	moderate

my sad fucking life english is not my first language, sorry i grew up in a conservative catholic family, i love my mum, dad, my brother and sister. from the beginning, i always had to pass the standard set by my parents which is good grades, behaviour, attitude, helping house chores. i was happy with all of this and it is the same reason i developed a sick mindset that if someone passes you, you re not good enough and through out elementary, i never got to enjoy playing around with other kids. i was always focused on studies and because i was a loner i became anti social. i hated people, despised others, always have frown on my face and its just shit. when i went to st year of highschool grade here in asia i was a bookworm, a very agressive person. but it changed when i converted to islam not going to get into that but yeah, i am the only musli am in my family . it was going good, until my family started questioning me about my belief and scaring me that musli ams are terrorist hahaha if i was a terrorist, i would have left a long ti ame ago . eventually it set off a chain of events that haunts me everyday because of this i left home, i skipped school because of all this drama. i guess i am heartless now, i am scared to open up to people around me. i am thistant with everyone in my family, i dont care as much with my school. it is the memories, always stuck in my head. waking me up at in the morning reminding me of all the shit that happened in the past, all the painful words, all the anger and hatred. making me want to just end it. i am not truly accepted in my family because of my different faith . i am sorrounded by toxic people at school. its just a cycle. i would be like this for days then it wi will go away. hahaha its gotten to the point where i have no one else to talk with, now i am at reddit hahaha. i do not even know if anyone wi will read this shit. just everyone please, stay happy 	moderate
depressed, but not sad. i think the fucking worst thing about my depression is that i have not lost hope, and i am not a sad person, most of the ti ame. i just have this mental block that kind of makes me feel like dying because of it. it is not an i want to die feeling its more of a welp, i am never going to be able to cli amb out from underneath this rock that is the lack of feeling and motivation so why not go ahead and die i long to do something meaningful with my life, and to be successful, and consistently happy and it angers me the longer i go without doing so, but it is like i am possessed by something that wants nothing more than to push me the other direction, a voice nagging at me to stay in bed all day and isolate myself from everyone. i am scared i wi will never leave my hometown or find myself and where i belong, and i would not be able to blame anyone but myself, even though it is the last thing i wanted.	moderate
suggestions please i feel like i have little to no ability to form insight about myself and my behaviours. the easiest way to describe it is like how a zombie feels nothing, right? it only knows to seek out brains but it does not know how or why. i think that is a good description of me, except instead of brains i am looking for a job and attending school and trying to maintain personal relationships, the way people do. i do not know why or how, i just have an innate ability to do it so i continue to function, like an automated human. i am not an especially good or talented automaton, but people that i think i care about continue to remain in my life so i must be doing reasonably okay. i can not describe it super well but i feel like my personality is a shell and i just react to sti amulus like an insect would if it were met with a predator or obstacle. there does not seem to be any inner thought process going on that i can identify when i interact with other people. whatever part of my brain that takes control when i am placed in a situation where i have to socialize seems to do an okay job, as i can usually maintain small talk and make the right facial gestures and whatnot. i am certainly a human, that much is obvious when i look in a mirror, but i do not feel like a person. or maybe i do. i do not know what that is. i have been diagnosed with adhd by my doctor and i take a sti amulant medication for it, and it helps, but even the ability to maintain focus does not seem to help me gather how i feel on a day to day basis and form a general consensus type thing about what is wrong with me. does anybody else have a si amilar experience? tldr i am an empty person, how i feel at any given moment is alien and foreign to me	moderate

the world changed when i got depressed so we grow up thinking and learning that the world does not change just because we get sick or run into problems. the world goes around as normal we are led to believe. but in my case, there is been one thing that has completely changed, since my life started to go wrong. it is how people respond to me now that i am lost and depressed as opposed to vibrant and well put together. i have a high education and have been working for years in my field. it has always given me a sense of stability to have my wits acknowledged and to able to connect to people easily and find the good in things. i lived in a fancy apartment in a very good neighbourhood. if i had to make a phone call to someone about something back then, it would be with enthusiasm and about some minor detail, like arranging a birthday party or getting a vaccine for my kid etc. every communication that i had with people was pleasant or non dramatic. i did not have a reason to contact anyone to solve my problems. well, the relationship fell apart. i am the one who had to move out. i never found a place to rent or buy after that. it is been years now. i have been renting many places for short periods, as this has been all i have able to find. my mental health has been going downwards for every year that has passed me by, without a place to call my own. i have had to call everyone and everything to fix my problems ever since. it is been one thing after the other, because of the domino effect. i can not find a place, so that adds major stress, i have to store all my stuff with family and with storage services, find a place to keep my address, figure out how to deal with that in conjuction to the fact that i have a kid with my ex and i can not just move my address far away without getting into trouble over it. i am just floating around out here, like a balloon. i wonder when i wi will completely float away. life took a turn and everything changed. it is a nightmare and i am performing miracles everyday just to make it into the next day, but the problems keep piling up and the people, the way they respond to me now.. i have found that everybody in my social circle is either a stranger now or apathetic towards my situation. i have no adults to lean on and everybody puts this extra thistance or contempt towards me. i have had no help. i have really thiscovered society as a cold place that has just laughed in my face when i needed it the most. i feel used by society and thrown away like garbage. every ti ame that i have had to explain my ordeal to the municipality office or a doctor etc., they have talked to me like i am stupid after learning that i am stressed and depressed. it somehow takes away my credibility as a person that i have become depressed. everyone speaks to me in a baby voice and i just almost reject the world for what it has become to me. now i am just shattered into bits and pieces mentally and can not even find a beginning or an end to this mess. it certainly feels like the dark night of the soul, but more than that it feels like the world changed when i changed.	moderate

how do you get past this ? i served . years in the army . and i was very depressed at the end of my term , even being submitted to the hospital for a week . i used to say everyday before i got out i can not wait to be home. i have been home for almost years . i sti will say it to this day. i just broke up with my girlfriend of years which i have known for years . moved out of the apartment we got together , and moved in with my father . whose been anything but supportive. using my gi bi will to do my passion in cars which seems to be the only good things going for me. recently breaking up with girlfriend, has definitely put the depression weight on me again . i am having trouble sleeping as well . i have turned to tinder with no success. i feel like i can not go to the gym because i always feel like i do not know what i am doing and see mini amum gain which sucks . so with all that going on , i just feel lost . i feel defeated. i can not find that happiness in other things people talk about . i have no idea what to do besides just keep moving and keep myself busy . i wish i could just fast forward you past this hard ti ame in my life .	moderate

can coffee help depression? so caffeine never really affects me energy wise. i can drink energy drinks and not have any boost in energy. someti ames i even get more tired. i have depression, mostly social anxiety and i am buli amic. recently though after not drinking caffeine for months i drank like cups of coffee at once for fun. the main thing i am noticing is that i feel a lot happier and have wayy more motivation to do things. like, i just cleaned my whole room, i dont feel anxious or like i am wasting my day, and i havent thrown up today at all. i have more energy though its probably because i actually feel motivated to do something and less depressed. i know coffee suppresses your appetite so that is probably helping me not overeat which is what triggers my buli amia throwing up. i have heard large amounts of caffeine can make you more anxious but i dont really feel that. is this normal or just coincidence? also is there any risks by self medicating with caffeine or drinking large amounts everyday?	moderate

i need to let out my feelings on gcse results day in i was kicked out of my school due to not meeting the high grade requirements. i think i always subconsiously knew i was never going to make the grades and stay there and i think that is where my depressed thoughts began. a few of my friends also got kicked out of that school and all went to a different one the same one as each other . i, however, was forced by my parents to go to a different school, where i knew nobody and had to do a levels that i didnt want to do in the first place. i dont blame my parents as they were trying to get me the best opportunity. but me being already quite nervous in social situations, struggled to make friends in the first couple of weeks. this huge knock in confidence has caused me to become even more nervous, and i have developed a nervous tick where i bite the insides of my cheeks. i am currently in my final year of school, where i sit alone and have done for almost years. last year i used to go on walks on my own during frees and lunch, to spare the embarrassment of being alone all of the ti ame, however i have stopped caring and instead i just sit on my own. my grades are very bad as well, i can never be bothered to do any of my work, even when deadlines are approaching fast. i have even recently started to self harm, where i punch myself in the leg as hard as i can. although i havent done this in a few months now, i am not opposed to doing it again. despite my bottled up problems, i am sti will very greatful for my friends who i see once a week at football but talk to online often. i am also greatful for my loving family. if it wasnt for my friends and family i think i may have taken my own life by now. for anyone that read this passage thank you, i just needed to get it off my chest. x	moderate
senior year sucks sorry for the long post. i graduate in months and i am anxious. my high school experience has been pretty crappy. i play football and i wrestle. or used to i guess. going into my senior year i thought it would be the best year by far especially because junior year was so rough, i went through allot of anxiety and depression that year. the start of summer made me think that everything was uphi will from there and i had started my first job at walmart and my supervisors all talked to my mom about how i was one of the best workers they have had in a while my mom works there too and football camp was great, i thought i had a chance to at the very least start on special teams it was only my second year . i was talking to allot of people and hung out with my friends almost daily. i was doing pretty good. then one day i was driving to work in my grandpa is truck when i got in a car accident. the worst part is how it happened. no rain or wet roads, no fog, no ani amals in the road, no other cars on the road, literally the most ideal driving conditions ever. i fucking rolled it. i had just gotten my paycheck and it was blowing around in my car because i had the windows down and i was thistracted trying to save it from blowing out the window and i went off the shoulder of the road, freaked out, over corrected and rolled onto the road. luckily i came out with nothing but a broken hand. but that was enough to make me lose my job at walmart and i could not participate in practice anymore obviously. also i have a would be badass scar on my hand but every ti ame i look at it i just remember how dumb i am. i stopped seeing my friends everyday and did not even want to go to camp anymore because it just sucked not playing. the county fair came around right before school started and that was fun. i saw my friends again and showed countless people my hand and told them what happened which sucked. school started and once again i told countless people the most embarrassing story of my entire life. the doctor said i would be cleared for practice about weeks into the season so my hope for football kinda dropped from there. it was nice to see friends daily again but everyday sucked. i was depressed again and was always in my head. after i was cleared i did not play all that much so when football ended i did not care at the ti ame. all that mattered to me was wrestling. we had a new coach who was probably the polar opposite to our last one who became the assistant coach. he had wrestled in college and was something of a wrestling legend in his hometown so we all wanted to make hi am proud. the wrestling season went better. i was wrestling and actually seeing myself in shape and body fat made me feel so much better. i loved wrestling and it helped me not be depressed. i also got a therapist which helped a ton. i actually was pretty happy. the biggest downer was that i only won one match it was my rd year . about three weeks until the end of the season the assistant coach tells me that i was ineligible and i tried to get my grade up but every ti ame i would get one up, another would drop. i eventually got kicked off the team right before regional which sucks. which brings us to now. i miss football and wrestling so much. they are all i think about, and i am never going to do either again. during wrestling season i would go to bed and i amagine me winning a match and it would help me sleep. during football season i i amagined making some play or doing literally anything and it just made me so hopeful that something would happen. here i am now, career wins in wrestling seasons and no stats in seasons of football. i wish i could go back in ti ame and change everything but i can not. i feel depressed and anxious constantly. and on top of all of this i graduate soon and wi will probably never see allot of my friends again. and there is so much more but i already typed a whole novel. maybe the next couple months wi will be different but i do not know. i feel like every ti ame i get ahead or am happy some big stupid bull crap ruins it.	moderate

wrote a poem. liquid thoughts liquid thoughts run through my mind. i have felt them flow to find their delta, and pool into the conscious tide which smooths the pebbles of my mineral memory. on the cloudy peaks of my perception, they precipitate, incepting streams which etch the slate of my meandering soul. intangeable, the force by which they fall it calls their steady trickle through the troughs carved by thoughts that came before. liquid thoughts, i have felt them dig their trenches, i have felt their saline currents flow through the scars in my soul and into a restless sea, waves now crash and crush my brittle memories. glaciers crowd my clouded peaks and frost my feelings, a flood of which my banks could not afford. in fear to let them thaw, i patient, and grow numb, my sonder raw. more intangeable than ever the force endures. insatiable, it lures my landscape into winter, but the cli amate of my broken soul is all but seasonal as now, these liquid thoughts, they run my mind. liquid thoughts they run my mind. 	moderate

the endless cycle hi guys, i am usually one that suffers in silence but i got some news today that actually makes me need a hug. since i do not have anyone but cats, thought this might help. the short story is i found out today that at , i have kidney thisease. i am not really surprised since i have been an energy drink addict for over a decade i hardly drink water and my gma died from kidney failure. it is like the devil is triangle for kidney failure. i think i am finally seeing that i am not invisible anymore. like, growing up i never had any health problems. yeah i was chubby but healthy. i turn and i am basically falling apart. kidneys are shit, my eyes are getting worse, my weight is a joke, and my depression has gotten worse. like wtf is up with this getting old shit. of course there are ways to make this not as big of a deal as i am thinking it is. the info i got was of course drink a ton of water and be healthy. easy to say, hard to do. do any of you manage to do things that your depression would normally stop you from doing? how do you get over that hump and ignore the demon?	moderate

making yourself do things when all you want is to stay in bed i struggle with this a lot. i had a few month stretch recently where i was just going to work coming home and getting high. i am sti will struggling with being so dependent on weed but i have been doing other things to help escape this cycle. i started giving myself a chunk of ti ame after work that i can not sit down and watch tv play games. then i started trying to find things to keep me occupied. i have been going to the gym and doing cardio and i go about x a week for a month now. x in a month is better than none! i have been drinking less sodas and looking at ways to eat a little better. basically i am taking little steps in the right direction and not punishing myself for my struggles. instead of giving up entirely cause i am struggling with sobriety i am finding positive ways to counteract it. when i started exercising i have started caring more about what i am consuming cause it is hard to burn calories it is easy to eat junk and snacks. idk what my point is. i guess i am just proud of my efforts and wanted to share it with you guys.	moderate

was going to talk to my parents about my mental health, ended up not doing it after many month of ifs and hows, i finally decided to talk to my parents about the state of my mental health, tell them what i experience almost daily at this point and my course of actions from now on. i figured that even if they did not understand or believe me, at least i would have gotten rid of a bit of emotional weight. and then all that went out of the fucking window when my mother pretty much called me useless did not say it but i amplied it, not the first ti ame btw . at that point i was like not worth it and did not tell them anything. i mean by now, they should have caught on that there is something wrong with me, but to be honest i did not expect anything more from a mother that yells and swears at me every single opportunity she gets and from a father that is completely clueless. but hey, i at least have someone who understands me. someone who has always been there for me when things were shit, even more now. and that is depression. that is why getting rid of it is like throwing away the only person that gets me. i hope that when i fall asleep in a bit i would not get to wake up. but knowing my luck, i wi will probably close my eyes, open them up minutes later and it wi will be dayti ame and i wi will have to get out of bed and go to work. can i call a ti ameout on life please? no? ok then...	moderate

here it comes... i am slowly starting to thistance myself from people more and more. even when my heart is yearning for someone to listen to me i do not even try to search my msssages for someone who might respond. this part really sucks. the part where you feel an episode coming and you start to surrender from it. how can i not feel at all but hurt so bad at the same ti ame? my favorite ti ame of day is when it is over and i am laying in my bed at night. i can just be depressed freely without having to pretend that i am happy. the day is so exhausting. forced laughs and small talk. especially the business i am in... i have to constantly talk to people and be friendly and i really just want to look them in the eye and say i really just want to go home and lay in bed and not exist for as long as i want. that is why nightti ame is my favorite ti ame of day. if i can cry that day, then i wi will cry and soak my pi willow with my tears. i can pick at my skin without people starting at me rip the skin off of my fingers or scratching my face. i just want to feel better. i just want to wake up in the morning and feel better. depression exhausts not only your heart and mind but your body too. i am so tired... i just want to sleep for a week and i sti will do not think it would be enough. i am constantly yawning falling asleep on the couch after work watching a tv show with my parents. i remember when i used to smoke blunts with my friends and have a great ti ame but now i am usually the one who gets high and passes out before . oh and my stomach...nauseo, diarrhea, cramps. going days without eating because you re scared you might throw it all up in the middle of your work day. and when you have depression and do not eat for that long, you start to feel your body deteriorate. your muscles ache and your head hurts. either way, i am in pain. i can not win when it comes to my stomach... you know they always say it is darkest before it is dawn, but i have been wondering what if dawn does not come. what if the sun never comes up. what if it is just dark and cold and empty forever? i would sure miss the moment that the sun breaks the darkness and says hello. or the way the sky blends into white to orange to pink. i sure miss it right now.	moderate

so my depression is very much tied to being lonely and having extremely low self esteem. i regularly take part in those subreddits where people are looking for friends and people to talk to. this one person posted about how she wanted snapchat friends. specifically friends. so i chatted her. she gave me her snap name. i added her. she asked asl, we swapped that info. she asked for a face pic, which is common on those so you can put a face to who you re talking to. i sent it, and she says, and i quote i am going swi amming talk later with no punctuation and i i ammediately got the notification that she removed me as a friend. you re not always going to mesh with someone, but when you re just looking for friends and then i ammediately drop it like that, really makes me feel bad. i know it is not something i should take personally, but like. my self esteem is already trash and it is like cool. i am literally so ugly that i can not even make a friend there have been a couple decent people that talk to me when they can, but i have had over conversations die either before they got started or within the first hour or so. my message is always the last one sent. like am i that insufferable that people would not even give me a shot? and it is not like i am going to hit on you if you re a girl, i am asexual. i could not give a rats ass about anything like that.	moderate

i feel like i have everything anybody could want and i am sti will not happy i have a . gpa, decent friends, a bf, internship experience, a great house, money, etc. it is all good on paper. yet i feel so so so so bad. some days wi will be good. other days wi will be terrible. someti ames i think i beat it but my everyday habits are sti will terrible eating too much or way too little, can not sleep easily, barely motivated to do anything, half assing assignments, never listening in class, my brain feels like there is a mental block and i can not think clearly. i cry so much that i think it is normal but when i tell other people they are pretty shocked. my biggest obstacle rn is my career. i have no motivation to do anything related to it, my mom is forcing me to continue the internship from last summer but i wi willingly fucked it up and she is screaming at me why i did not take it it makes no sense. and i agree it makes no sense why i am ruining my own future. i have no initiative. anyone else in my position would be jumping at the chance. the thought of working again makes me so sad. i hate how mentally weak i am that i am given everything yet sad about the stupidest shit. i can not feel grateful for anything i have and when i try and show gratefulness to anyone it is so cringy to me i do not understand why. biggest eye opener to me that i was depressed was the amount of weight i lost. everyone around me comments on how i need to eat more and i can not fit in the clothes i fit in high school anymore and had to get new clothes. i hate my body and how small it is where i look like a child. i want to go to therapy but i am scared that if it does not work i wi will be trapped with depression forever. it is my last way out and i keep pushing it aside bc either a i think i am getting better or i am scared it is not going to work and i am out of options. these are just my jumbled thoughts sorry if it does not make sense	moderate
i am not okay right now another throwaway. i can not handle this anymore. can someone please please please help me. i have been trying so hard to get better, but i can not. it is like i can not see how else this is going to end. my relationship sucks, and i know he wants to leave me. he shuts down when i am like this, and he is the only person in the house. of course, the only voice left is the one inside. i do not think i wi will make it out this. i probably would not hurt myself today, but you know the thought has passed through my brain a mi willion ti ames today. i wish i can sleep and not wake up, and it wi will be the best solution for me. if only i did things right, and i would not be in the situation right now. it is all my fault. i hope everyone else has a better day than i have right now.	moderate

i am slowly descending in to a very dark place and it is frightening me... before i start i am talking about a previous suicide attempt of my own as part of my ongoing mission to open up and talk as well as trying to learn about myself as best i can. as such i must say this before going on... major trigger warning sensitive issues so i tried it five months ago. i found some seconals in a medicine cabinet. i remember watching cartoons and taking the pi wills one by one. a neighbour lady found me and could not wake me up. i could not open my eyes or move, but i heard everything. i remember the lady shaking me and saying, oh, my god. i remember the ambulance people taking off my clothes and making me throw up. there was not any pain. i do not remember having my stomach pumped. when i woke up it was five days later. a big black lady kept tickling me. bout ti ame you woke up, she said. i have been tickling you for three days. i thought i was in heaven it looked like some place in heaven for the misfits. turned out i was in the basement of a mental health clinic, a long corridor with rows of individual rooms with all kinds of teenagers, pregnant girls, suicides, drug addicts. we walked around in gowns, smoking cigarettes and watching tv. the reason i tried was i was angry at my baby mother, but when she came in to pick me up the state sti will had her as my next of kin she just said, why d you do this to try to get attention? told me rayne did not even recognise me he smiled at me the moment she said that, he remembered. am i glad i was rescued? oh yeah. i was so glad i did not die. it made me realise how much i appreciate myself, because i had a gli ampse of what i might have lost in the months afterwards. i have made some friends and i would have missed all that. i did not have to go home after that, peyton dropped me off at a friend is i was staying with. they put me in another hospital a week after. the state made me go to a psychiatrist. i never liked the man. i thought he had more problems than i did. i felt drugged and slow for a couple of months. every now and then i would take my medication to feel normal, largely i ignored it. downers sti will make me feel speedy anyway. you know if i had a suicidal friend now i would ask them, why do not you have any alternatives? could it really be so awful? that is what i say to myself now. the unfortunate reality is i am lying to myself and as every day goes past i am edging closer and closer to where i was that day months ago, and i am realising this ti ame there may not be the good samaritan to edge me out of it.	moderate

help. i am reposting this on an alt for reasons that wi will take a while to explain. i feel like i am going insane. it feels like i have seperate voices that are my own voices, that i can not god damn control. and i always thought this was normal since they werent other peoples voices, but they are saying bad things. someti ames violent stuff, someti ames stuff i dont agree with, calling the people i care about bad things. and then another part of me starts getting paranoid thinking what if someone is listening to my head and can hear my bad thoughts to the point where its a regular occasion that i try to silince my own head, in case someone can listen, but i can not, because as i said before, i can not god damn control them. and when ever i tell anyone, they just tell me i am either insane or i am an idiot for thinking my own voice in my head has multiple personas i guess you could call it. i have also been aithiest for a while. and there is sti will a part of me that tells me when ever the bad thoughts rise up, that i am going to hell, and the dead relatives can hear every second of my life. i amagine having to know your god damn grandpa has been watching you do, think, and say everything you have done for a year. its gotten to the point where i can not god damn concentrate. please just give me a chance and hear me out. tell me i am not crazy and how to fix this. would it be worth bringing all this up at the next check up with the doctor.	moderate

i do not know why i am posting here. but i have to say this stuff somewhere i guess. maybe you re like me? i have been hurting and so lonely lately. i do not know what to do anymore. i am in such a dark place. things just would not get better. i have not been able to get out of bed and go to work for two days. i have the pto to cover it, but my bosses get all pissed off at unexpected absences, and it is like my th or th this year. i am so lost and so alone and i feel like i have no one and nothing in my life outside my kid...and that kid loves me to death, i am so thankful for it, but the days when i do not have her are agony. and i know she feels sorry for me and spends ti ame with me, but it is ti ame that is being taken away from her grandmother and her cousins. i am years old and i do not know how to meet people or make friends or live a totally sober life and i feel like i just have nowhere to turn. a guy i used to work with thought he would play match maker and nudge me and this lady together, said we d be perfect for each other, so i got all excited...come to find out she has not dated since her divorce, is not really interested in dating because her life is so busy with her kids, and i am pretty sure my attempts to talk to her and get to know her were more irritating than anything else. it is everything in me not to go crawling back to my toxic ex and beg her to take me back. after everyone cheered me for walking away for how she treated me...but not stepping forward to be a friend in her absence. even if my emotions were irritating and bothersome, even for all the ti ames she answered the phone annoyed saying what?! ...i deluded myself into some kind of happiness. i am a lonely, introverted, homebody, video game playing nerd. i want someone to spend these lonely nights with, even if it is just chatting. even if it is just a friend. but i do not know how to get those. the people i thought were my friends mostly abandoned me after my divorce. the few who stuck around i give money to on a regular basis. go figure. i do not know why i am posting this. i do not have a question or a request. i feel like i am screaming into a void. i am drowning my sorrows in alcohol because the weed man ran out. i am lost and sad and alone and i truly do not know what to do anymore.	moderate

part of ? reposted from main account so you could see the different parts easier idk how to link yet, so just go look at my profile it should be at the very top, under this post. so many of you who saw the post on my main said bring up whats wrong with me to a doctor. well i talked to my parents about this, and they said that this could seriously jeopardize me going into the medical feild. keep in mind, i sti will dont know if i have schizophrenia, but i know whatever the fuck is going on with having arguments with myself in my head, somethings not damn normal. it is gotten to the point where i can not concentrate in class, and when ever i dont have a thistraction, my own voice starts saying stuff i dont fucking like. and now my eye keeps on twitching when ever i blink. i am scared my grades wi will start to drop again, because i went to hell and back trying to fix them. and i had my rd panick attack this week during math class. the first was sunday, at midnight where it was all dark and i started to have the bad thoughts again. i broke out into a sweat, it felt like the air was thick and i was suffocating. the second happened monday night. same deal. did not sleep both nights. now my last one was during class. i felt claustrophobic in an open class room and the air, once again, felt thick. i started to breath fast, and even if someone tried to talk to me to snap me out of the trance, it felt like i fell in a rabbit hole of my own thoughts. i am now considering suicide, as it feels like my only escape from this hell. please give me some solution, because doctors is no longer an option.	moderate

losing interest in relationships over the past year, i have lost interest in relationships. whether that be friendships or romantic relationships. despite this, i have pushed myself to continue to try to meet new people, go on dates, and maintain the few friendships i have now. i have lost interest in hanging out with people much. even if it is something i enjoyed doing before. i find myself going places alone. while i do not enjoy it or find it interesting, it gets me out of bed and laying with my depression. i eat, sleep, go to work, come home, repeat. i do not want to do much anymore. at ti ames, i have lost interest in therapy but i continue to go. after years of therapy and not much change, my interest is dwindling. someti ames it feels nice being alone in my apartment for hours, days, not doing much. every now and then, i wi will have a small interest in someone. almost moments after talking to them, i lose interest completely.	moderate

yeah, can not do it sorry if the title sounds a little too cliche. well anyways i want to die. so strongly. i am sick of the pain of day to day life that it has become. there is no hope because i know things only get worse even in moments where i think i am slightly better than usual. i am pretty open about everything i feel but i have over saturated all my statements and everyone has gotten used to them. either that or they never cared which are both plausible and real big thoughts in my head. i know everyone is annoyed with me. i feel as though very little amount of people care about me, and of those people i feel as though they are on the edge of giving up on me, that i am putting too much stress on them. the rest do not take me seriously and it hurts when they do that. i have stayed having problems trying to see any sort of nonexistent care for me from anyone. it is spiraled down into a state of self blame and hate. i do not know what to do anymore. i can not escape this mindset even when things might i amprove. if i can not escape my mind or the day to day situations that causes my pain then i just need to leave it all behind. i have kinda given up on strangulation cause i never go through with it, overdose is a consideration high on the list. either way i do not think i wi will survive past the week and definitely not the next month. i know all of you guys go through the same type of stuff and are probably sick of hearing this stuff from too many people but fuck am i supposed to do? bottling it up is not working and the places to turn to are shrinking by the day. it is the internet right? what is the worst that could happen. welp i wi will leave and try to thistract myself somehow, despite not having any pleasure out of anything and self harm does not work anymore either.	moderate
i do not know what to do. my life is a mess. honestly i do not want to die but i do not want to be here. my depression is usually never this bad but recently shits gone south hard. according to my therapist i was most likely raped as a child which i can not even fucking remember which is fantastic. i can not even tell which of my memories are real because it turns out one of my favorite memories never happened it was just my mind trying to hide things. i met this one girl who is basically me but a girl and we dated for a little bit but then she broke up with me. my therapist wants to put me either in a mental hospital for awhile or to put me on anti depressants and i know that is not that bad but i have been on pi wills most of my life and i just got off of them last year and i do not want to be put back on. the only reason i have not ki willed myself yet is because i made a promise to act in a musical and i know that they wouldn t be able to find a new lead in ti ame. the other reason is that i have been waiting years for the new ani amal crossing and i am going to play it even if it is the last thing i do. i just want to be good enough for people to compli ament me instead of ganging up on me. i do not even know who are my friends anymore. i just want to close my eyes and up somewhere other than earth.	moderate

i really do just live for the weekend is these days. the week is dark and dull. i dread it. i start the week with my ulti amate goal of just getting to the finish line. going to work makes my depression even worse. i come out of work at the end of the day feeling completely lifeless. once i am home, i have to be a mother but i do not even have the energy to do that. my poor son is just along for the ride and most of the ti ame mommy just can not wait to put hi am to bed. life, man. excitement is nonexistent. the only ti ame i feel even the smallest bit of life fi willing my body is on the weekends, when i do not have to work, when there is not a super rigid schedule, when i can breathe. but even that is short lived because i have to start preparing for the week on sunday. sunday is are hard too. i start getting back into my funk. i become lifeless again. everything becomes dark and colorless. when i wake up monday i just want to quit everything. everything feels so heavy. i am tired all the ti ame. i keep to myself at work because i do not have the energy to speak. i do not want people to wonder so i act like i am fine someti ames i even have the strength to fake a smile, even though deep down i am screaming. i do not know what keeps me going. maybe it is because i am a mom and have a little one depending on me. but even the thought of having such a precious responsibility gives me anxiety and depression. i do not feel like i can handle any of it. i can barely take care of myself.	moderate
i have reached a point where i feel i need professional help, but something is keeping me from doing so. for those who finally sought help, how did you convince yourself to do it? i do not know if it is fear, embarrassment, or the anxiety that i am seeking help with among other things , but i can not bring myself to schedule with a therapist or a psychiatrist. i wi will go as far as searching for some in my area and instead of scheduling an appointment i just close my browser. i am scared to go alone even though i have to. so, if you were able to convince yourself to visit a therapist or psychiatrist, what made you finally do it? bonus question what made you choose between a therapist and a psychiatrist?	moderate
i started cutting myself i always had suicidal thoughts but they were so small i never thought i would do anything about them, or even comprehend self harm. over the past few days they got worse and i wanted to feel different. i do not know what came over me but i grabbed a pocket knife and cut myself, i did not mean to but i continued, not thinking of what could happen. i am scared to think what my family would do if they found out, but i can not stop, i have to do it once a day and if i do not i feel like garbage. i do not mean to say this to gain attention, i just needed to get it off my chest.	moderate

whats the point of being creative when you can not actually create anything when i was younger everyone knew me for being creative but now i am so depressed suicidal that executing my ideas is really fucking hard. i have like hundreds of ideas but i always stop before i even complete anything. i wi will think of concepts for things i want to photograph or draw in a few minutes. i wi will have a dream and get inspired off it to make a short story but i never do anything. i feel like i am a waste of talent. this is so frustrating. it is like i am the ceo of never getting anything done. what is the point of having all this creativity when others out there are struggling to create need it more than me.	moderate
i do not see the point in doing things. for the last two years i have struggled with depression but this year it started to seem that everything is meaningless and has no end results. my grades are shit and that kinda made me think that why should i try to fix them and why should i wake up every day at and go to school when i am gona end up ki willing myself anyways. i know that i am supposed to talk with my friends because maybe they can help, but i am quite antisocial, i have friends but i only realy like some of them and it seems like they do not like me. i am not sure what i am hoping to get from writing in here but why not see what comes from it.	moderate
despite the successes i have made over the past few years, i can not help but feel profoundly alone and perhaps even worse, desperate for affection. history i am a year old asian male. i would describe myself as at ti ames socially adept but then at ti ames woefully inept. i have never had a romantic relationship before. i have only asked two women out in my life one was just getting out of a divorce, and the other was married. i have read numerous ti ames in places like r askmen that it is i amportant to work on myself before i subject others to myself, and all that stuff about being happy alone before being happy with someone else has helped drive me to work on being a better me. i have been content until very recently to just push aside thoughts of romantic relationships and work on becoming a better person. but then i wonder, how long? i do not have much ti ame left, i feel. the older i get, i feel like the less likely i am to find someone who is sti will single and compatible. i finally made it into nursing school this past semester for my bsn, and i found someone in my clinical group who is so fucking smart, so hard working and so beautiful she is fucking appearing in my god damn dreams. they are just vani willa romantic dreams, where we just spend a day together and then the alarm sounds and i am back to reality, and the dream begins to fade like smoke from a snuffed candle. of course, my first gut reaction to this is you re infatuated with her. it is nothing but puppy love. she does not deserve this kind of affection and you would be doing a thisservice to her and yourself if you decide to actively pursue this relationship. oh, did i also mention she is ? seven years younger than me, and bri amming with potential. i feel like i would only drag her down. fuck, she is so incredible. honor is college, ta, student tutoring on the side, and actively pursuing research for her planned ph.d. her work ethic is utterly inspiring and being in her presence pushes me to work harder. we both like science fiction, we can speak on each other is level when it comes to the medical sciences and i just really enjoy being around her. i enjoy her presence so much that i have been making an utter fool out of myself trying to get her to laugh, only to perhaps get a concerned glance from our instructors and an awkwardly quiet room. and that is also the crazy part i feel like i am actually good at being a nondescript student with a slight penchant for appropriate humor, and i have worked in healthcare for eight years, and i know how to be a professional, but around her i just fucking lose damn near all sense. but my insecurities are also sti will present, self concepts that i am working on thispelling. i am quite short and she is at least a whole head taller than me, around or so. my research into the dating scene also reveals asian men as one of the least desirable populations for women to date. of course, the other, better me says if she cares that much about your height and ethnicity, she was never going to be a good match for you anyway. so then i think, okay, why not just ask her out and see what happens? then i think, what is the worst that can happen? it could harm the group that we belong to and make it that much more awkward for the of a semester that we have moving forwards not to mention that we also have summer classes together as well. again, i think, well, if she is not mature enough to let me down easy and keep our business between us, then maybe she was not ever worth it in the first place. and then i start thinking why even assume anything about her and her preferences and all that in the first place? just ask, i think. just ask. be si ample, no expectations beyond just expressing a baseline interest, even if inside you re way the fuck past that. i bri am with confidence for a brief few hours and i think, listen, we ll just ask her to dinner and it does not have to be anything more than that. if she feels it, and we really feel it, then maybe we ll go for it. but if not, that is okay, and at least you tried. ti ame passes and my doubt overshadows the fledgling confidence that i had just held. i do not know anything about relationships. i do not even know where to begin, where to go, what to do. i have some vague ideas of how a relationship is to be that most of a relationship wi will be the mundane, and that not all of it is necessarily a whirlwind tempest of passion, but a slow grind together towards shared goals. or maybe i am just completely in the wrong and i actually really, truly, have not the slightest clue of what it means to be in a relationship and my thoughts are purely fantasies and rainbows in assholes. to further expand, i am scared that i am just not good enough that i do not have the life ski wills or experience to keep and hold a relationship healthy and alive. i just... i just really wish i had the guts just to do it. at least then i would know, but the threat of rejection again, after all of this stupid emotional investment would just crush me. anyway. i know this is not quite on the caliber of some of the posts in here, but i am just tired of being alone, when all of my friends are finding dates or are enjoying loving, vibrant relationships or are already happily married. i am... i am just really tired of being alone and not having someone to share my life with. even if no one reads all of this bullshit, i am just a bit better having written this out. if you have read all the way, then i thank you for your ti ame.	moderate

do not feel the same anymore this is probably going to be a bit rambly, so bear with me. so a little bit of an introduction, i am and recently went through a really bad breakup. we met when best friend introduced her to me and she started hanging out with the group people including me and her . she made good friends with everyone and things were awesome for the ti ame being. my favorite part of hanging out with those guys is they really got my sense of humor. not to toot my own horn, but if the whole gang was laughing it was probably because of something i said or did, and i loved making them laugh, it made me happy seeing them happy. after we broke up it kind of tore the whole group apart and we stopped hanging out altogether. aside from a few friends who i only see a few ti ames a month, i do not have anyone i can spend ti ame with regularly. and all the people i talk to do not really seems to understand me like they did. back then, i really took pride in the fact that i could find the humor in just about any situation but recently i feel like i have become more serious and lost touch with that. as a result not only do i not feel like myself, i feel like i have lost part of myself. whenever i compare myself now to how i was back then it hurts to see how different i am, and not for the better. i felt so lively and full of energy back then, now i just feel cynical and bitter. i just want to get that part of me back, the part that can make people smile like before, and i do not know how.	moderate

my friend needs help i can not give so this post is focused on my friend and he just broke up with a girl. he is in his first year of college and i am in th grade. so i thought this wasnt a big deal cause it happens to everyone, but he hasnt stopped talking about ki willing hi amself for over months now. they were together for a month. i am in a mental struggle trying to find out if he is doing this attention or if he genuinely needs help. i have tried talking to hi am everyday and also giving hi am a break. i cry every day thinking about it. we used to talk every day and chi will... anyways, i am obviously young and have no experience with this. another one of our friends is doing the same thing i do but we both get so angry when we get responses such as i am chi willin bro or the worst only thing to fear is fear itself and so many more. i am so sick of this because i would not the old person back. i can not stand the mental stress he puts me through with the thought of losing hi am. other things he says is that he tried a therapist but they gave up on hi am. he gives fuzzy details about this but posts about it everywhere. he also said that when he talked to his mom about hi am being suicidal she said that its not ok to feel that way. i do not understand hi am and i beg for your help in helping hi am. thanks if anyone sees this at all.	moderate

i dont really resonate with the idea of loving myself since or before can not remember, i found this idea of loving yourself, i know its something that has been around forever but ever since i found out about it, it kinda grew up a lot and became a mainstream thing. my point is i have tried every idea, activity, exercise, whatever i can do to love myself. eternal hours of meetings with myself to love me and appreciate me and for some ti ame it kinda worked but lately i realized that i was faking it. no matter how hard i tried i just dont love myself, and i hate how it has become an idea that they sell that magically your life wi will change and you wi will be another human being if you love yourself but so far i feel is not real. i have learnt to see my positive side and my negative side and while i do accept i have amazing traits, i really really thislike my shadow, my depression, my negative and pesi amistic outlook in life. idk i guess i am thissapointed. someti ames i accept all of those things but i know i dont love them. and also pretending i love myself is tiring at some point because i know that is not the truth. what do you think of that term?	moderate

i need help. okay, so recently a hell of a lot has been going through my mind and big changes in my life have occurred. recently my stepdad was diagnosed with stage iv liver and colorectal cancer. he began chemo about a week ago and it was very stressful on his heart. well, two days after he did not have a heart attack, but there were severe pains in his chest as the doctors could not find out what happened. he is sti will alive. that friday, when it happened, i was picked up and taken to my sisters with no knowledge of what happened. fast forward a week and i am just..struggling? to be happy, that is. i really can not find a reason to get out of bed anymore, many bad things are happening, and everything just takes so much effort i feel. everyday is such a chore and task for me that i now ask myself, is it really worth it? now with this question i have often found myself coming up with the same answer. no. this month, year, whatever, has been terrible. i now feel that everything would progress without me. i just need someone else is opinions on this. it is not an attention post, i just need some help.	moderate
i can not afford to live in the bay area without my parents, but i do not want to leave my family and friends if you go through my post history you can probably get a decent picture of my situation. i am , probably mtf transgender, my parents would not accept it. i live in the bay area and have a support group of friends who help me be my internal self when i meet them. additionally even though my parents probably would not accept me i love them to bits. i do not know what to do. i always fantasize about moving to some isolated part of the country where it is super cheap but then i remember that i would probably be miserable and clueless without the help of my friends. i want to move out and continue living here but then i remember that i would be living paycheck to paycheck in an apartment with four other people and i would probably have daily panic attacks from the claustrophobia. i want to transition while living with my parents but then i remember i would have to face my dad with a look of gri am thisappointment on his face every day, if not anger. i want to spend the next ten years saving money and then move out and not live paycheck to paycheck and finally transition, but then i wi will have wasted my s being unable to live as my authentic self. i want to change my career to something that would allow me to live more comfortably here, but then i remember i originally tried to do that and it ended in me self harming because of how much i hated it. what do i do? i am at a loss. this post is like half me venting and expressing sadness , and another half seeking for genuine advice but i honestly do not think there really is an answer....no matter what choice i make i am going to have to make some sort of concession somewhere .	moderate

feb , i do not have anyone to vent to currently and a lot has happened so i am just going to let it all out before the worse comes. feb i was caught cutting myself in my bathroom downstairs. i was not sent to the hospital, but my parents were very concerned. this is the first ti ame since last october anyone has found out about my cutting, they thought that was the last. my parents found my notes. i mostly used it as an outlet to express my feelings, but now they believe i am on the brink of death. which i never wanted to die, i cut myself that night to feel pain, and not just sadness and desperation. my therapist does not know about all this, not even the cutting, because i was always afraid he would send me somewhere i did not want to go, but now my parents have set it up a meeting for tomorrow where the four of us wi will talk and i guess the truth wi will be revealed. honestly, with the position i am in right now in life, i am just scared of what is next. although this did help getting out of my system, there is so much more i wish i could talk about, but i wouldn t want to feel like a burden. i am going to go to bed now, hopefully it would not be so bad tomorrow.	moderate

how do you deal with being stuck in the past? i am not sure this is the right sub because i am not clinically diagnosed with depression but i have to admit that i am probably depressed to some level. i am , female and i have been recently hating spending ti ame alone. i have always been very introverted and i have always cherished my solitude more than anything, i actually loved being alone and getting to know myself even while having a good social circle. i have recently starting noticing that once i am alone i get stuck in my head , going down a spiral of thoughts and emotions leaving me trapped in a play by play of my past. i just live my present days remembering my childhood, my ti ame with my ex and my dad who passed away a couple of years ago. i have stopped knowing who i am because of this. it has left me with a sense of self loathing because i feel that i am powerless and weak which i have never felt before because i always thought highly of myself . it consumes me to the point that i am realizing i do the bare mini amum to be in the present friends, family, work, eat, etc , but the truth is my present is just a slideshow of my past and i can not do anything to stop it. i do not even know who i am anymore because it looks like the rest of my life is going to be just like it is now. what should i do?	moderate

i have to vent. i am so tired of being ghosted by women. i am just so tired of it. girls in the past weeks...all thought it was leading to dates, and yet was ghosted. every. single. ti ame. it is unbelievable. i can not even vent anywhere aside from here, because i get judged. if you tell anyone this that a woman just randomly decides to ghost you out of the blue, they wi will blame you, and say you re the problem, that you did something to make her ghost you, when in reality this is just the normal thing now a days for women to do to guys. i am just tired of this shit. today was the last straw. i have been talking to this girl since the weekend. our conversations have been fairly good. she is been interested, and responds quickly. she is very into the conversation, and wanted to know more about me. i ask her out on a date for this coming friday. she agreed, and we both sti will kept talking. i thought everything was fine. all of a sudden today we were talking, and then minutes later she completely removes me off social media. she blocked me off everything. she deleted me off tinder where i met her . i mean this is unbelievable. this is not the first ti ame it is happened. i did not even do anything. i did not say anything stupid, creepy, or anything. it was a normal conversation that me and her were going back and fourth. and then she just completely removes me. i am just so tired of this. i am beyond tired, and i just need to put this out somewhere, because no one wi will get it. people here wi will probably bash me too, like everywhere else. i can not do this anymore with women. i do not like men, and i am not gay, but i think this is it for me. i am years old, and i am constantly getting screwed over in possible relationships, or dates, or just anything with the opposite sex. i am just done with this. i deleted everything, including all my social media. i wi will check to see if i have any responses in the morning. i am too fucking depressed to even stay up right now. goodnight all.	moderate

a plea for an end so...this happened tonight. i had to...well i am not sure if it wi will make sense... i do not know if i can do this any longer. heart is forlorn words made mind blink a couple of ti ames, the heavy weights at the corners of his mouth momentarily forgotten as his brow furrowed in thought. it is not often heart speaks so clearly. that in itself is something to note. you can not do what any longer? mind asked in confusion. sure, they had not been on top of the world, but things could be so much worse. in fact, things were fine. i do not know. that is what scares me. heart replied sadly. mind noticed his gaze was fixed on the knife in his hand. a very sharp, stainless steel knife he had used hundreds of ti ames for cooking. it was actually his favorite kitchen knife. in this instance, he had picked it up to slice and apple for a snack. what do i have to do to make this stop? mind looked at the knife too and felt a faint stirring of alarm begin to flower. i do not know how to make it stop. i did not start it in the first place! i mean...can not you just ignore it? mind asked. he looked nervously at the knife. he had never known heart to do something like this. where was this coming from? heart turned the knife in his hand allowing the single light over the kitchen sink play across the blade. up, down the blade it went as heart stared at it. his right arm rotated ever so slightly, exposing the forearm for a moment. we have been ignoring it, you know that. you have been rationalizing them as down days, bad days, or days where i was just being moody, even when i tried to tell you it was more than that. we have even tried to search online to figure out how to fix whatever this is and how to make it stop. it is been going on for a long ti ame now, nearly a decade. i am just so tired, so sad, so... heart is voice trailed off as he seemed to be searching for words. depressed? mind supplied. heart almost i ammediately started shaking his head. no. well yes...but no. heart responded. mind looked confused, but then upon further reflection, he slowly nodded his head. you re right. that is not it. something caused this depression...but what? why are not you happy? you have every right to be happy. you are married to an amazing woman who loves you, you have a great job, and friends, and... heart is frown deepened, but he kept his eyes on the blade. and what? he prompted, then shook his head angrily. the fruits of my labors have been what? if i die tomorrow, what wi will be missed? the provision i supply, the money i donate, and...why are you shaking your head? heart demanded angrily. you know it is true. mind sighed. he is heard this one many ti ames before. people love you. mind stated. you know that. heart is grip tightened on the knife, and a bitter expression suddenly fi willed his face. but i get all the broken ones! he hissed. i get them, and then i feel like i have to help them, and do whatever i can to help them heal, to mend those broken things. i have to teach them about what love is, or what a good friend is, how to trust again, how to smile again, but what about me?! his voice is now an angry shout. i look back and every ti ame i get the broken ones. yes, i love them, but what about romantic love? what about someone seeing to my needs? heart asked hotly. why do i always come last?! why am i always treated as an afterthought?! just once i want to not just love someone, but to be in love! just once i want for someone to...to...well fuck it. what does it matter? heart is head drops and his shoulders slump. he sighs sadly, and places the knife on the cutting board next to the apple mind had placed there moments before. mind was silent for a bit trying to absorb what heart was trying to say, and what he had said. i...think i am starting to understand. mind said uncertainly. but what can we do? we have made our choices, you and i. we can not go tearing it all apart just because we re not happy. it affects everyone else around us. i know you, and you would not want to hurt those people. tearing everything up in an effort to find...whatever it is you re looking for would do just that. heart swallowed hard, and his eyes watered. but i can not keep going on like this either. he said quietly. i cry so easily, and at the dumbest things. i get jealous for the dumbest reasons, and when i find a new friend, i cling too tightly...and that is just the tip of the iceberg. you know that. this is not how a normal person acts. mind nodded tiredly. he was exhausted, really. he was always exhausted. i know...and it is starting to affect me, too. i have had much more difficulty focusing, and it keeps getting worse. i can not ever rest until i am exhausted. believe me, i am as tired as you are, though for different reasons. i thought we would be doing something a lot different than we are right now, and quite frankly making a chunk more money than we are. granted, it has not been effecting me for nearly as long as it has you. mind confessed. mind and heart gazed at the apple, then picked up the knife and efficiently sliced it. a tear slid down heart is face, and as they finished slicing the apple, heart sniffed his nose, stifling a sob. see what i mean? this is stupid. i am crying. why? heart said. a sad smile touched mind is face as he replied, also ironic. it seems we re just as broken. heart scoffed, then looked at the knife. the blade glistened with apple juice. let us just take a sleeping pi will and get a good night is rest. heart suggested resignedly. maybe that wi will help. mind nodded. he desperately needed more than a few hours of sleep. it sounded as good of an idea as any, but then looked at the knife. yeah, but after we clean the knife. he said.	moderate

i am struggling when i am depressed, reaching out for help seems i ampossible. and this has gotten worse over the last decade since i was first diagnosed as a tween. it is partly because i do not want to burden people with my problems that i seem to cause for myself. when i open up to the people close to me i always end up feeling worse than i did keeping everything inside. i can tell my mom and my few close friends are sick of my shit. my mom absolutely blames me for not being what she considers to be a productive member of society. i am a full ti ame college student with a workload i am struggling to stay on top of, yet she feels i have too much free ti ame and should get a part ti ame job. she believes this wi will make me less depressed. she takes it very personally when i do not tell her how sad i am but when i do she makes me feel so much worse. i understand that i am partially responsible for how i react to my depression but fuck i am trying my best. at least i think i am. or else i have deluded myself into believing i am the victi am when in reality, i am just a lazy piece of shit who needs to stop feeling sorry for myself and get a job like everyone else. i wish they understood that i am frustrated with myself too. i wish i could do more, but most of the ti ame i am just trying to make it through the day without falling apart. i never post on reddit but i just wanted to scream into the void in hopes someone out there understands where i am coming from.	moderate

 m new to this so i guess i just say what is on my mind or something right that deals with my depression. the thing is i relapsed on my depression and suicidal progress. seeing everyone happy seeing myself in the background or the outcast makes my stomach turn. i had it rough but i do not think my mental health and my emotional health are ever going to get better. i am used to the pain and suffering i am used to being alone and feeling like i am nothing and someti ames when i get pissed because of it i hit my head or i look at the blade. so many questions run through my head i need a shoulder to cry on but no one stays no one wants to listen i feel like i could vanish and no one would care i should accept i only know bad emotions and no one wi will help me but wi will demand help from me i feel like i am a burden like everything i do is for nothing like i am not good enough... i do not suicide attempts already i do not want a th but as of late its been running through my head	moderate

i have been taking pain pi wills to make me feel better i got a tooth pulled a week ago and while i do not need pain meds anymore, i am sti will taking them because they make me feel happy for once. i know it is bad and i know i should not but i do not really know if i care about anything much anymore to be honest. they make me feel good and take away the emotions for a while and let me escape to somewhere where i do not have depression. somewhere where i am happy and actually enjoy life. somewhere where the abuse never happened and i have a family that actually loves me and cares about me. somewhere where i have friends and i do not just sit in the room that i am too exhausted to clean most days. somewhere where my health is better. i used to judge people who do drugs, thinking wow, who would want to mess up their life just to get high? but now i get it. people do not do it to mess up their life, they are doing it because their life is already messed up and they are just trying to escape. thanks for reading stranger.	moderate

guilt i feel so guilty about changing topics to about my life. like a friend went to a party and we were just talking about stuff. something about crushes gets mentioned and suddenly i just get the trigger to get insecure, which then leads to me talking about my life and suddenly i am crying as everything just hits. i feel so, so, so, guilty for doing this. i absolutely hate myself when i do it.	moderate
tip if you live alone, do not put things on the floor since i had my first bout of depression, my house has been a mess. someti ames my mother come here, and help me put things in place. but, unfortunately, most of the ti ames it stays thisorganized. for some ti ame now, i have been trying to change this. it is not easy, but an advice i gave to myself that helped me a little bit a lot, to be fair, considering the mess i used to live was to never put things on the floor . because, my depression draws so many energy from me, that if i put something there.. it wi will stay there. and things wi will keep accumulating.	moderate
stop drinking, it only makes your depression worse. everyone told me that and i listened. i stopped drinking. it helped a bit, but here i am laying in my bed wishing i were dead. i dont want to go to work tomorrow. i want to call in sick. i just want to lay here and cry and maybe after awhile i wi will just die. i just want to die.	moderate

spiraling because i was asked about my feelings missed a day of work after my boyfriend asked me what was wrong. i declined sex and told hi am it was because i felt off, then he asked me if anything was wrong. we have both been busy with our jobs and our hobbies so we do not really talk much these days which is a non issue, really but i suddenly felt really sad and thistressed over what is wrong? and how are you . i feel like crying but i do not want to, even if i am alone in my room. the mere thought of trying to process my shitty emotions makes me feel panicky. then i would want to drink, smoke, or hurt myself which i really do not want to do since i have been clean for months. i feel like i am never allowed to access my emotions and feel them because doing so means i would shut down. i can not afford that. it feels like the only way i can navigate life peacefully is through hiding my pain and sadness and trying to drown it out with video games or movies or whatever. it all just hurts a lot right now and i do not want to bother anyone with my bullshit. is there a term for this? is this just escapism? aaaaa 	moderate
i can not handle any more abandonment i am so sick of it. i am alone in this world. friends, family, everyone. i am not even kidding, i do not have a single person. what do i want off of my chest? i blame myself. if i was the person everybody wanted me to be, i wouldn t be in this situation. i watch youtubers to not feel alone. just to feel as if somebody likes me. but i am a year old man. how pathetic is that? it is sad. it is pathetic. how did my life come to this point?	moderate

i do not know what to do this is a pretty long speech so if you re not interested in reading something long, it is okay as a high school male asian student, i have been pressured every day to do more than i can. today, for example, my act score came out and i did a little bit worse than my first test from a to a . my mom started yelling what was going in my head while taking it and she started comparing me with others who cut out the practice problems they got wrong to look at later or how everyone in this test got good scores . now, i know this is clearly my fault and i definitely could have done better, but i have trouble concentrating while taking a test, especially a four hour one. what angers me so much is that whenever my mom yells at me for doing something wrong, she repeats the same thing she said in a different way at least five to seven more ti ames. she would take small breaks in between to. i understand what i did wrong the first ti ame she said it, but the fact that she repeats it over and over again makes me want to break something, but i can not because i have had those scenarios in the past because i could not take it anymore and it ended with my dad grabbing me by the collar of my shirt, ready to punch me. now, the reason why i stay silent whenever my parents yell at me for something i am doing wrong is because as soon as i speak, tears already start flowing down, my voice already begins to quiver, and i start stuttering frequently. in my mind, i want none of this to happen because it makes me look like a coward, when i actually want to look serious. lastly comes me as a person in general. from ti ame to ti ame, i start to think if people wi will care if i suddenly thisappeared one day. i am a junior, yet i am already overweight, i have really bad eyesight that i can barely see without my eyes, and i have almost no charisma. with this in mind, i just start to wonder if people would care if i died one day. sorry for making this a long speech, but i thought you would need this background info to give the advice. i recently took a quiz on this website https depression.org.nz is it depression anxiety self test depression test https depression.org.nz is it depression anxiety self test depression test and i got a score of out of , which i think is moderately severe depression. i never thought of myself of being moderately severely depressed, but now that i am seeing this, i am not sure what to do. i am sure my parents would not let me do counseling because they would just clai am i am not depressed in the first place and that it is a waste of money we re also barely financially stable so paying for counseling is probably not going to work . my school counselor is absolutely terrible at her job so she is not helpful at all. i do not know if i have anyone to trust and talk to at this point. so now i am here with my soul literally crumbling into pieces without anyone knowing because i do not know who to tell or what to do. what should i do?	moderate
so it is not much but i realized i have been clean from cutting for awhile now, a more then a year. like almost years. i was not sure if i should post this. but i have been so depressed lately but i had this realization today and i am so proud of myself, as si willy as that sounds. almost years. wow.	moderate

mental breakdowns before going to school work first ti ame posting on reddit, long ti ame lurker. just would like to see how many people can relate. i can not even count how many ti ames i have had a mental breakdown the day night before school or work. sane people would probably need a day or two to recover. i always manage to get to school work the next day after. not sure if that is a good thing or not. this was pointless, i am sorry.	moderate
depression symptoms have changed? so last summer i was super depressed. the big symptoms were i felt like a major burden, could not focus, did not eat a lot, and felt sad with myself and life. fast forward a couple months and do not have those symptoms but right now for the past months i avoid social situations, excessive sleeping and fatigue. could i possibly be relapsing and not realize it ti will now? or could these depressive symptoms be a sign of a coming relapse?	moderate
i am tired at this point it is useless. i can not do it anymore, at this point giving i feel like is pointless because it is all i can do. i have a shit personality that nobody would want to be around, try to do good things for people to try and i ampress but probably just get thisregarded in the process, do not have any actual friends just people who keep me around either for free stuff or out of pity that they do not show , and just make people hate me when they talk to me because my existence is pestering and should not exist. i only give and do things for people because it is all i can do, i can not make people smile or laugh. at this point i am just a waste of fucking space and do not deserve to live on this planet, and should just end it all successfully this ti ame. small vent i guess.	moderate

dark thoughts coming back i hear people all the ti ame say do not hurt yourself, you matter and i even find myself whole heartedly telling others this when they say they are suicidal, but when it is said to me it is like they are speaking another language and i can not comprehend what they are saying. i si amply do not matter to anyone. i do not matter enough to eat regularly. i do not matter enough to take care of myself. i do not even matter enough to get help. i just feel like my whole life wi will be spent hating myself for being in the way and taking up useless space that anyone else could use. i feel extremely expendable and idk how much longer i can take.	moderate

reasons i hate myself i am ugly, stupid, slow, not talented, i am pretty sure i am not straight, i can not talk to people, i am awkward, i have ugly scars on my thighs and arms, i can not draw for shit, i am lazy, i am a terrible brother, a terrible son, a terrible cousin, i have no emotion when i talk, i am always tired, i hate my voice, i hate my hair, i am creepy, and i am super unlikable. i am sorry i needed to get this out, i am considering ki willing myself before i turn . i do not know how long i can do this.	moderate
how do i know if i have depression? so, pretty much my entire life i have been a pretty sensitive guy, but ever since the new year my whole life has been pretty shitty. at the start of the year my mother had a miscarriage, and that hit me pretty hard. ever since that my parents have been arguing a ton more after hearing them fight through the walls i have figured out that we are moving back the old state we used to live in about a decade ago. after hearing that i have just been really sad, and i have had no motivation to do anything in life, and my grades have been falling since the start of the semester. also, since january i have pretty much been putting on a front. more recently, i have been doing a bit better but not much. i basically just focus on using things like music and video games to thistract me from being sad. even when everything in life is going amazing i sti will feel really sad. an example of this happening would be yesterday, which was my birthday. for no reason yesterday i was really upset and spent most of my day just laying in bed watching youtube trying not to cry, and nothing bad was going on, i just default to being sad now. sorry if i sounded super edgy, but if anyone could help me that would be great.	moderate

back at square one after assault this is probably not the thread to post this at but i really have no wi will to live and feel like what happened this weekend really validates it. i finally mustered up enough courage and strength to get out of the house to meet mutual friends for dinner and a few drinks. i planned to go straight home after that but was persuaded to stay because i looked like i needed it we end up at one of the mutual friend is houses p to keep things easy and a few more people showed up. p came up to check on me and gave me another drink, she said she would watch out for me and if i sti will felt like i needed to go home she would have someone take me. about mins after that drink, i needed to use the bathroom. p showed me the way and held my drink for me. then things get extremely blurry. i tell her that i need to go home and she has a friend take me. he was kind and kept talking to me and kept asking if he needed to stop in case i needed to puke he walks me in and supports most of my weight but i can feel his hand traveling. i struggled and squirmed away from hi am but that caused me to fall and then i do not remember anything. the next thing i do remember is waking up in my bed with my clothes ripped and not on properly and feeling like i would been battered all over. i stumble to the bathroom and in tears feeling like the biggest moron for going out. i notice there is vomit and small splatters of blood on the floor. i scrubbed myself raw and washed all my clothes and the bathroom at am. tell me again how big of an idiot i am. that could have been potential evidence i think he assaulted and may have raped me. i have tried to get in touch with p, i have called and texted but she would not answer. if i just had not gone out that night. i was depressed before but that kept me somewhat safe and inside the house. my biggest safety issue was myself. now i can not sleep because of the nightmares and feeling like the moment i walk out my door it wi will happen again. i could not stop it from happening as a child and here i am again, right back at square . i can not do this anymore.	moderate

back again hi r depression it is been a while. i have been going to support groups. i have been managing to make myself exercise. i have been keeping track more of my diet and keeping my gastrointestinal thisease in remission. i have been taking vitamins and drinking water. i have been volunteering. i have even gone to networking events. i have been keeping a normal sleep schedule, dressing nicely, and grooming carefully. i have let myself believe that maybe i have found an avenue to getting employed, supporting myself, and staying employed. i have let myself believe that maybe there is a way for me to cli amb out of the depths and into the sun. i have been setting goals, spending almost all day out of the house going from one thing to the next. i have been letting myself take on more in my schedule and checking in with myself when bad thought patterns surface. someti ames i have decided to believe in myself preemptively in order to give something the best attempt. i have been getting better. and yet today i have felt like dying. i have felt incapable of progress. i have felt incapable of just enduring the endless cycle days beginning and ending, coming and going, fi willed with pressure, doubts, stress, pain, weight, thiscouragement, grief. i have felt pointless. i have felt like a solitary person stranded at sea in a life raft. like the last person sti will alive after a worldwide pandemic. surrounded by nothingness, destruction, decay. completely devoid of purpose, direction, or meaning. i think of everyone i have known along my life who was my age and has already died. freak accidents, falls, suicides, violent riots, fires, thisease. there is no fairness. there is no justice. there is no redemption. i am so tired. i am so beyond bored of the same and the same and the same and the same and the same. i am tired of lacking the wi will to even inhale and exhale. if my body did not autonomically manage breathing along with everything else, i probably would have called it quits at some point already. what am i going to do? i am not going to ki will myself. i have enough buffer to wait around here a little longer and see what happens. i am not on the brink, tip toeing on the edge of something so visceral that i need to consider drastic action. i am going to wait a little longer just like i have done all my life. wait around a little longer for living to begin making more sense. i am going to keep going back to support group, to the only people who know who i am. i am going to tell myself that i believe in me. i am going to see if i can find a way to make that true. i am going to keep pretending like i can fix things with good sleep, good diet, good exercise, good socializing. and if i actually can then i wi will find out. i am going to wish i could stop spending so much ti ame on the internet, rotting my brain. maybe even pass a few days succeeding in abstaining. but without genuine, meaningful obligations, my brain wi will slip into withdrawal of engagement and i wi will have to relapse on modern day is pernicious addiction. it is been nice checking in with you r depression . see you next ti ame	moderate

i do not know what to do in my country we have an standardized test called psu that is supposed to choose who can enter college. i recently did mine and had mediocre results, good enough to enter, not good enough to have an scholarship, i know this sounds trivial but it does not feel like it, my family is very poor, we can not pay for a complete tuition and i was supposed to be who was going to raise us above the poverty line, this whole situation really is the straw that broke the camel is back, throughout my teenage years i have dealt with depression and anxiety since i live in a very dysfunctional house, now that the results came in, they refuse to acknowledge them, i ask them for help and they say later, i am busy , that worsens it, cause i start to feel selfish. i have never felt so alone, all my friends are either from more wealthy families or more accepting of taking a year to study, but i can not, i refuse to do nothing. in the past i have fantasized about suicide, about seeing my loved one sad about my death, but now it feels real, easy like i could anyti ame, right now though, i do not want to, but who knows tomorrow or weeks from now. sorry for the bad english 	moderate

nearly considered ki willing myself last night its just getting too much every day. crying by myself in bed, rooted to the fucking ground. i hate this life so much, particularly myself. i hate myself when i am happy, its just temporary and i feel out of place. i would rather stay in bed all my life now, and sleep forever. but i have to go to school, do exams this week, everything is just too much. i do not care anymore. last night i really considered running away and hanging myself somewhere. now its a few minutes before i have to set out to school, and hopefully not break down. i hope everyone here gets the help they need, but for me, i am too far gone at this point.	moderate

i hate myself i expressed to a crush that everyone is life would be better without me in it. if i had never existed at all, everyone would be okay. like my existence so far has had no i ampact on them so if i weren t even here, they would sti will go on with their lives and they invalidated my feelings and told me they do not believe that i actually think that. i had high functioning depression since hs, i am now , so i feel like no one takes me seriously when i say i hate myself. i am an advocate for mental health. i have seen the declination in friends and family who have suffered from depression. my sibling even once had an episode and tried to commit suicide and put the reasoning for wanted to die on me, and that has taken the biggest toll on me. obviously i do not want my sibling or anyone else to die so i am an advocate and generally share positive things on my social media. but someone telling you that you re the reason they want to die is fucking devasting. from the outside looking in, i guess i am okay... when i eas in school, i sti will woke up every morning, get out of bed, and got good grades but what good is it all if i do not fucking love myself? i hate that i am such a burden on my family. they pushed me so hard to achieve academic success and even went so far as to rearrange their own life goals to help me get that far. i graduated top of my class, and am debt free because they paid for my housing and tuition. despite being a college graduate, i am financially dependent on my family. i have not been able to land a job and it is eating away at my self esteem and self worth. nothing in my field is hiring near home and no one thinks i can take care of myself so moving out of state is out of the question. these past few months, my depression has been getting worse but i do not outwardly show it. i am finding it difficult to motivate myself to get out of bed and do household chores. since i am currently unemployed, i am expected to do things around the house while everyone is at work. when they get home, if i have not completed my tasks, they make comments like, oh what were you doing all day? or they tell me to do things and say, you do it, i am tired from working. my family is asian and so mental health is not addressed or taken seriously, so i try to keep everything to myself. i cried in the shower for minutes today and then went about my day like nothing happened. at around in the morning, i find myself awake often and i just cry wishing that i was never born	moderate
i am depressed but definitely not suicidal so it all started when my dad passed a few months ago. i quit my job so i could join this program at my community college. basically went to school mon friday am pm so i can get this certificate that was supposed to get me a job in the chemical plants. it has been months since that and sti will no job and my old one does not want me back. my car motor exploded out of nowhere and i have no money to fix it. the people i live with are the pettiest people ever towards me even though i literally stay in my room all day and night and do not come out unless it is to shower, wash clothes, food, or to leave the house. i have been continuing my education and my grades are slipping. i have no motivation to work out. i just do not have any happiness or anything positive in my life right now. the only thing that keeps me from going off the edge is my wonderful girlfriend she is the absolutely best. oh and if i even talk to my mom about my problems all she says is just go get some medicine. i dont want to rely on fucking meds!!!!!! i just need to find some type of passion. i am in a horrible slump and i do not see a way out	moderate

reading other posts on here has already helped tremendously with the shame i have been feeling lately. as heartbreaking as reading some of these posts is, i feel like just coming here and realizing i am not alone is the first step. ive been knowing and ignoring this struggle at the same ti ame and it is so paralyzing. i have read other people is post putting into words what i couldnt and it gives me solidarity and helps with the shame. some days i want to just run and run in hopes that somehow i will jolt out of this. i never do though, the more i dream about running away the deeper i sink into my bed and the sti willer my body becomes. it is as if i am physically rejecting the fantasy, but even if i fulfi willed it what would be gained other than a hollow escape? as awful as it is, putting it into words helps at least. to everyone else out there i hope ive given you something to relate to as others have done for me on here. you re not alone, and these feelings are not a choice. i hope my words on how i am feeling help you to feel less alone in what you re feeling. thank you to everyone else on here who was brave enough to share what you re going through. you have given me the courage to start doing the same.	moderate

 it is going to be fine that kind of positive thinking is exactly how i landed into depression you dumbass. by repeatedly telling myself that things would i amproved on their own, only to end in a awful cycle of hopes and thisapoitments. i recently watched the video stop wasting your life by prince ea and realized i have been a jae for years. i f cking hated high school. most of my teachers were jerks, i had bad grades, got shamed and yelled for it at home, had only one friend and even then, i only saw hi am at school , got anxiety for being closeted among openly homophobic peers and was insanely jealous of my sister always going out with friends while i stayed home playing video games. oh and my estranged father stopped giving a shit about us the second my mother took exclusive custody of my sister and i. i told myself that teenagehood was a hard part of life and that i would be happier later. during the summer after graduation, i was the happiest and most hopeful i ever was. high school was finally behind me. i was going study more interesting things literature , i would meet more mature classmates, i was going to eventually find love. well, that after a rough start, my life was finally beginning.... except, it was even worse than high school. cursus were insanely hard, boring and while classmates were more matures, i sti will failed to connect and make friends out of them because i sti will had anxiety while they enjoyed their life. oh and since my university was in my city, i never left my mother is home so just like high school, i i ammediatly went back home after class and never went to parties. my numbers of friends went from one to zero. i told myself that it was just one year wasted and that next year was going to be better. long story short, i ended doing an easier but boring course in administration with older pears i also failed to connect with. i told myself it was going to be better once i find a job. i spend then years unemployed and bored home at work and ashamed of it. once i got a job, it took me six months to burn out because of the stress and loneliness. i am stuck in a small office with no colleagues in sight waiting for the end of the day. oh and i only had days off the whole year. now, i realize as a year old friendless virgin that youth just went past me. i have been brainwashed by society and myself into believing that i was going for a bright future that has never come and never wi will while my high school acquaintances have fullfi willed lives and have long left their parents home and starting to have kids. while taking mindfulness cursus to cure my depression, i learned that i spent my life daydreaming about another world than living in the reality and the present. so do not you dare tell me it is going to be fine .	moderate

entering a very dangerous stage hi, idk why i am writing this, who wi will see it, or what it may accomplish for myself, but i felt like sharing some of my story. i thought i cli ambed out of what from what felt like the depths of hell, but it seems i never truly escaped its grasp. like many here, i have had depression and anxiety since before i even knew what the words mean t last year, was my senior year in high school, i was at the top of my class and i had big plans to get into a prestigious college and finish off my high school career excelling. god, the universe or whatever all mighty being that controls us however, had other plans for me. my life seemed to fall apart piece by piece in front of me. this may seem crazy to some but it was the beginning of my devastation. my hs releases the top of the graduating class every year by gpa and posted the order and the students pictures in front of the auditorium. i am a quiet and shy person and i felt this was my chance to prove myself and it was something i strove hard for. when the results came out, i realized i had missed the cut. after speaking to my friends and comparing the gpa is of the students on the list, i realized i missed it by . points. at the ti ame, my sister was at odds with me and my family over a myriad of issues including her arrogant asshole boyfriend who she refused to leave no matter how many ti ames she was manipulated by hi am. i was extremely close to my sister throughout our childhood, but she, along with her boyfriend repeatedly thisrespected and took advantage of my parents and i. facing all of this family conflict i sat there powerless. my words mean t nothing to my parents or my sister and despite the fact that my sister ended up getting kicked out of the house after an argument, my parents continued to pay for her dollars k tuition. i loved my sister and when i contacted her truly offering my best advice, she wouldn t hear anyof it. she threatened to cut me out of her life for good. i was thistraught, and due to this and the accumulation of the depression over the years of stress, i finally broke. i ended up missing missing over a quarter of the school year mostly consecutively while i was enrolled in mostly ap level classes including physics c e amp m in one year , calc bc including ab content , and us gov pol. during my ti ame away from school i began self harm, thoughts of suicide grew, we searched desperately for help, and i had to convince a doctor to not have me put in an adolescent psychiatric ward as i sat on his patient table i have nothing against good psychiatric wards, i just knew it was not the right choice for me . eventually i found my match a pnp saved my life, medicated me correctly and i was on my way to recovery. however, now i was faced with the challenge of catching up on intense ap classes while remaining stable. my teachers all advised me to drop my classes, but i refused. on my transition back i worked the hardest i had ever worked before. i was allowed weeks of half days to help myself accli amate, and everyday those two weeks i came home and watched my teachers math videos from pm to pm on double speed. i followed all the class notes, and did all the homework. i was able to catch myself up completely except for tests taken to the rest of the class within those weeks. i ended that year with s on all my aps except history. this was the biggest accomplishment of my life and i was extremely proud and while i missed a few college application during my ti ame out of school i was accepted into an engineering program at a school ranked in the top for engineering in the u.s. that year. i wanted to share this to show you guys since many like myself think its the end when something like this happens, but you can persevere with the right help and determination. do not read more if you want a story to have a good ending i wish i could tell you i stayed in a good state of mind after all that but sadly i have fallen in darker ti ames than i have ever experienced. i rarely leave the house, and i wake up every morning depressed with a lack of wi will to live. i chose to take a semester off from college after i came close to ki willing myself and moved back home with my family. things have been extremely rough and i am starting to feel like the people i used to be able to count on are no longer there for me. i feel lost and the prospect of suicide seems more and more inviting as the days pass. i have other university prospects and am on a search for a part ti ame job but my motivation falls everyday and my wi will to carry on has fallen to an all ti ame low. i can no longer even describe how horrible i feel, and realistically the only thing that has stopped me from ending it all is my friends and family and i can bare the thought of how it would affect them. i have resorted to heavy use of marijuana and abusing the increasingly higher dose of drugs i am being given for my symptoms. i have blacked out from these drugs once so far and truly believe i could have died from the combination i took obv this was not the recommended usage of the drugs . i feel like i am at the end of the road and if things dont get better soon i may have to find my own way out. i wouldn t wish this upon anyone and truely hope all of you guys suffering from mental i willness your best life possible thanks for letting me rant... needed an outlet. this turned out to be long af sorry i dont expect anyone to read the full thing.	moderate
i miss my older self i miss when i knew who i was, mostly in highschool. i did not have the best of experiences during that ti ame, but at least i knew who i was, was not afraid to show it, and was loved by some for it. now i feel like i am in this extremely fragile bubble that can pop at any insult or judgement. i just miss being able to talk to new people without having panic attacks and actually being able to be who i want to be without fear of repercussions. being an adult has made me crawl back into the shell i was so happy to be free of previously. are people really as hateful and judgemental as i i amagine them to be? i just want to be me again. can there really be people out there for everyone or an i just damned to stir around my own bad thoughts forever?	moderate

i do not know so i am pretty young grade and i might have depression but i am not completely sure. since grade or something kinda clicked with me where i just became unhappy. depression is something i hear about all the ti ame around me. people who cut themselves, people who sleep in through multiple classes. but for me its never been myself clai aming everybody hates me. i think i am an average person not too bad but not too great either, ive just always been unhappy with myself. i do not think its quite as bad as it was last year with thoughts and plans about ki willing myself in the very week and coming close to cutting which i could not bring myself to do . my normal mood or default mood is unhappy. but it seems i do think about ki willing myself in the future with detailed planning. i do not remember why exactly, but in my mind i believe that i am going to end up ki willing myself in my mid to late twenties. i have thought about getting help, but i also i might have light anxiety and can not talk to family, teachers, or doctors about this. even gaining the courage to post this is getting me shaking pretty bad. so i do not know if i should get help and how i would do that. last thing i want to say is thank you if you read this mess of confused thoughts that i spewed on the page.	moderate
i am allowing depression to stop me from being the man i want to be i did not have an easy life up to this point. there are people who have had it harder than me but when you spend the bulk of your life getting beaten down to the point where you just begin to accept the beatings, you know something is wrong. i have been doing a ton of self reflecting and through listening to people in the psychology field, i am now realizing that i have fell short of what it means to be a man. i do not mean the traditional, muscled up, jack of all trades, rough around the edges kind of man. a man to me is someone who can take life is challenges on the chin and take responsibility for his actions in all circumstances. there are ti ames a man may falter but a man gets up again, reevaluates and overcomes. a man wants to provide the best life for not only hi amself but those that he cares for most. whether that is financial security or just making sure he is happy and by extension the people around hi am are happy. my familial connections are severely damaged because i could not live up to the mountain of expectations put on me. i grew up bullied because i was taught standing up for myself was wrong. i endured six years of abuse from an ex because of that mentality after i had graduated. i spiralled into depression and stopped giving a fuck about my health. i gave up nearly all of my friends and overindulged in hobbies that are not healthy while giving up the ones that were. i made bad decision after bad decision. even when i made good decisions i did not have the mental fortitude or thiscipline to see it through. i made excuses. i am very depressed and very lost and quite frankly, i have given up on myself for quite some ti ame. but i want to be a man. i want to be the man i know my father is despite our differences. he is sti will my i amage of a good man though we re polar opposites. he overcame so much controversy in his life and no matter the obstacle he buckled down and persevered better than any person i have ever met. i do not know if he suffers with depression but given what i know of his upbringing, most people wouldn t have survived, especially not unscathed. i love my dad and i hope one day i can be as good a man as hi am. i wi will never do that if i give in to the emptiness i feel right now.	moderate
i am so tired of trying all the ti ame i am so tired and pissed. i just can not go in like this. not one good thing happens. these past two l years,i have been through hell and back. i lost people who i was close to,all in a span of a few months. i sti will pushed ahead. even this year began with a devastating news. i sti will kept my head above water. but i am so tired of all this. i can not keep my sanity when everything goes right for everyone around me,but it all crumbles when it comes to me. i am trying more than i possibly can,yet the people who do jack shit get by while i am struggling. i can not take this,it is useless,it is pointless. how long do i have to go like this? where is the fucking light at the end of this endless tunnel? i am just waiting for the breaking point to lose it. get a reason to go give up. not that there is not enough reasons currently.	moderate
 motivation i do not want to even go to school anymore because i do not do the work, i know i have to because i need good grades and my parents want me to but i can not for the life of me get myself to do work, i have about packets of bio homework, several tests and other things that i just would not, just can not do. how the fuck do i get motivation when it feels like my life and mental state is just falling down an infinite staircase. if it could all just end i wouldn t have to deal with this shit. i do not cut but someti ames i wi will just punch myself in the face because i am mad at myself or i hate myself because i am a useless shell of a human being. i know writing this is not going to help but whenever i try to talk about how fucking garbage i feel it makes my friends and family sad. oh poor them. oh i am sorry i wi will stop, i wouldn t want you to feel sad, it is not like i feel that all the fucking ti ame every day of the week month and year. and i can not ki will myself because i care too much about the people who say they love me. there is probably one person who maybe maybe maybe has a sli am chance of actually liking me but the rest just show sympathy so that they feel that they helped and they feel good about themselves, wow i am so glad they did. but i wi will just be here, in the fucking corner, suffering until i blow my brains out all over my ceiling.	moderate

mental health issues in university rant i am a third year in a fairly high up university in the uk, and i am just completely cracking under the pressure now. i realised i was not a massive fan of my course early on and did try to switch, but did not have the necessary a levels to go to a different course in the same university and my parents managed to convince me to not change universities. i only have a few more months until i am finished for good but the pressure has got too much i suffer from ptsd as well as depression and the flashbacks have gotten intense recently, usually putting me out of commission for some ti ame afterwards. i do not understand what triggers them so i am just terrified the next one wi will happen. funny thing is, as horrific as the flashbacks are, it is the fact that i find it difficult to work after having one that bothers me the most. even getting up every day has become increasingly difficult and i am resorting to unhealthy behaviours just to sort of cope. any ti ame off i take makes me feel extremely guilty, because i feel like i should be working constantly to keep up with everyone else. somehow i have managed to submit my work on ti ame so far and not been kicked out, but i am writing this post instead of doing an assignment due at midnight tonight because i just do not understand it...i am severely under the word li amit, it mostly is not coherent and i can not see myself passing the assignment at all. i would ask my lecturer for help but strikes mean that he is not answering his email is not around. i am running on less than two hours of sleep not without trying to sleep and every ti ame i realise i can not do the work, i start to panic and my mind goes blank. worst thing is, i know that this is my fault. my fear of failure and perfectionism means that i was putting off an assignment i found difficult because i did not want to admit that i could not do something. my self worth is definitely wrapped up around grades and intelligence, so finding out that i am probably not particularly intelligent has been a difficult journey. i understand that being academically gifted is not the only form of self worth, but it feels like that is all i had to be proud of before i went to university. i know that one failed assignment is not the end of the world, and i could resit the year or the module, but i can not bring myself to submit something that is not at least somewhat decent...thinking about it makes me feel nauseous. i would almost rather not submit anything and fail automatically than submit the utter mess that i have so far. it feels like i have hit a wall, that there is no alternative to failing this, and that terrifies me. my family life is extremely difficult and is the source of my ptsd, but i find myself wishing i could just run away from all this to my home. every ti ame i go to bed i dream about somehow escaping or being in a freak accident that means i can not continue university, or somehow skipping past all of this hell to when i am completely finished. i can not drop out now as that would be a waste of the last and a half years of my life as well as god knows how much money, but i can feel myself losing my grip on my emotions more every day. i know my mental health problems are not an excuse for my lack of effort, but someti ames i find it near i ampossible to sleep, eat, exist, never mind work tirelessly for hours on end. i find my attention wandering every five minutes and i do not know why. i do not know how the people around me are submitting decent assignments each ti ame, and it feels like i am the idiot for not understanding some of the work properly. being a high ish achiever in sixth form but then seemingly struggling i ammensely whilst everyone else gets on with it is really thistressing. i feel like i somehow got into this university by a fluke, and any decent marks that i get are false or mismarked, and that any lower marks i get are a true representation of my worth. i am fi willed with so much self hatred that someti ames it is difficult to see why anyone would bother being around me. i genuinely do not understand why my friends are sti will friends with me, as i feel like i contribute nothing of worth to a relationship. and i do know that this is not the be all and end all to life, but at the moment it feels like it. i know this probably sounds like someone whining about small problems, but i feel like it is destroying me. i regret ever accepting the offer to go to this university, and wish i could go back and choose to go to a less intense university. if these are meant to be the best days of my life, then i do not think that bodes well for the rest of it. though i have never really believed that that is true. anyway, if you read it, thanks for reading my rant. i am going to read a few lines of my assignment and try not to cry.	moderate
my school nearly had me admitted to inpatient long rant so this all happened yesterday and i am sti will kind of in shock about it and i do not think i have processed it yet. i had written a list last week of things i had to complete before march st before i ki willed my self and i fucking lost the note. some kid at school found it and handed it into my teacher and somehow they figured it out that it was me who wrote it i think i was on a watch list or something . they call be into my student wellbeing office and tell me they found it and they have called my parents and i freak the fuck out and i do not know how to take it in and then my mum comes to the school and they tell her about the note and she is panicking and crying and shit and we all go sit in a room and they basically tell her that she has to take me to hospital i ammediately because i am in crisis. which is bullshit because i felt fine emotionally because my date was a month away and i was not feeling suicidal at all. i keep asking i do not want to be put into adult inpatient i am and they are insisting that i wi will be admitted to inpatient and i am terrified of that. i keep asking if i can just go home and change my clothes first and my well being keeps telling my mum that if i go into my room i might be going to grab a blade or something to off myself then and there which sure i understand protocol but i just want comfy clothes. then i am escorted by two teachers to my locker so i can grab my bag and they have to carry it and then my dad arrives and my parents take me home so i can get changed and then we go the hospital. we wait in the er for like hours before an assessment mental health person sees us and she is really nice in really glad i spoke to her but she lets me go home because of my honesty or whatever as long as i went to a appointment this morning. i got a call this morning asking how i am and if i tried to ki will myself overnight and then telling me to go to this appointment which i do and we just talk about a bunch of symptoms and shit and now i have a appointment with a psychiatrist next week. i feel like i have shut down because i am somehow kind of calm but i am so confused because everyone was treating it like i would attempted already when i was clear about it not happening until next month and now everyone is so fucking patronizing towards me and i am so embarrassed to go back to school next week and have to talk to the well being counselor who saw me freak the fuck out and was insistent that i would be taken into inpatient. like i was not suicidal because i told myself it was happening next month but now if anything that the situation is escalated i feel x worse and so fucking numb i am just really confused and freaked out. and so far the only treatment mentioned has been therapy? and i do not want to ask for fucking meds in case they wi will think i am a junkie but i really thing i need something chemical instead of just talking about shit because it has not worked before	moderate

i feel isolated and like a failure tw self harm this is just going to be a vent brain dump because everything is too much right now and i need to get it out. i know that having depression means that life often feels a mi willion ti ames harder but lately it is been feeling i ampossible. my mum died last year and it feels like i am expected to be over it by now. i have been taking antidepressants for probably a year now, but in the past few months they have been making me feel constantly dizzy and nauseated. i am exhausted and doing even the most basic tasks feels like it uses all my physical and emotional energy. my boyfriend has moved to a different town and both of our cars are currently broken meaning that we can only see each other on the weekends, which normally would be fine but my anxiety brain is making me self sabotage the relationship and trying to convince me that he does not love me anymore, and with no physical contact for a week, it is hard for the logical, non mentally i will part of my brain to thisagree. my mum died last year and it feels like people expect me to be over it by now. like the people close to me get surprised if i get sad about her and i do not want to feel rushed in my grieving. si amilarly, i just do not think those closest to me truly understand the extent of my depression no matter how much i try to explain it to them. today just felt i ampossible. i am not sure why it was today exactly but everything was too much, my friends were too loud, the thistance between my boyfriend and i was too far, and my brain was too busy for me to even try and form a logical thought. i self harmed in the shower. before tonight i was probably close to around a year with no self harming. i feel like a failure. i just want a hug and someone to tell me that it wi will be okay and that they love me even though my brain tries to convince me that i do not deserve love and that one day things wi will get better. but i am alone tonight.	moderate
i do not cut, but i do hurt myself a lot i do not exactly self harm, but when i am in a really bad state, which has been very often lately, i wi will punch myself, bang my head or choke myself. i have actually choked myself to the point of passing out a few ti ames. i have never actually cut myself and idk, when my therapist asks me about self harm i do not know whether i should say it, does it even count? i do not know why i do it it is just an instinctual thing when i feel so overwhelmed and i am worried that if i told anyone they would think i am crazy, it sounds crazy.	moderate

i feel like my mum is holding me back from getting better and i do not know what to do. i truly try to stay positive and keep moving, but it is starting to become i ampossible. i have an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed and make my mum proud. she is always been really strict with me and has always told me that i have to work hard and never stop no matter the consecuences, but i am just not okay like this. everything that could be going wrong in my life is actually becoming real i am currently stuck in the first year of a college degree that i despise with my whole heart, not only because of the degree itself but because of the classmates that i have, which have little to zero empathy and judge people by their looks. they are just straight up mean if you re not like them and life there is literally hell. even worse than highschool. not only that, but me and my long term partner broke things up early this year, my grandpa passed away, everyone on my dad is side is depressed or i will in some type of way and i somehow feel like i have to carry their problems with me and my mum does not want me to leave this fucking degree in fear that i might stop studying which makes zero fucking sense to me, because i truly want to study a degree, just one that i actually like . what i feel is that, i do not have physical ti ame to neither decide or take action on what i am supposed to do to get better, because my mum refuses to allow me that ti ame or believe that i am having a really hard ti ame at all. she just blames me and says that i am too weak, that life is not a fairytale and that i have to deal with my shit on my own and not bother anyone else. but i am fucking tired. i can not anymore. because of having broken up my partner, i realized the incredible amount of self esteem issues that i have because of all i have gone through, and i just know that i need help. every day i wake up is a living hell. my mind just would not leave me alone and i do not know what to do to stop it. i know that having the amount of ti ame and resources to go to therapy and to start working out wi will help me feel better, but i can not do neither of those things because of her. because she wants to control my life to such degrees, she does not even let me decide for myself. because she thinks she knows me better than i know myself. i tried to talk to her multiple ti ames, but she gets very verbally violent with me and physically threatens me. everyone around me agrees that it is her holding me back and pushing this overwhelming amount of pressure on top of me, but i do not think i have the courage to go against her because i am really afraid of her. she holds power over me not only psychologically but money wise. however, i am not underage anymore, so technically i am an adult in the eyes of the law. so, i just do not know what to do. i do not know if i should just hold on until this school year passes and then do another degree or just run away as far as i can and start over. i just want some fucking peace.	moderate

can depression lead to psychosis? i am missing ti ame, like i am sure i was just sleeping, but for periods of between hours i have just no recollection of what is happened. maybe it is because i have been doing nothing, or nothing worth remembering, but someti ames i am really worried i have some kind of thissociation problem or like i end up in a weird state and then fall asleep, wake up and just assume i slept the whole ti ame. if that is not the case and it is just paranoia, then it is sti will worrying because i am convincing myself of this fact. i turned my phone off for a couple of days earlier in the week, and ulti amately ignored my family, work, and my therapist. then i went back into work on saturday and nothing felt right. i could not really remember what i did over the two days, and checking my internet history there is hours of blank, between pm and am. i would only woken up at am that morning so i could not have fallen back asleep after just hours, right? so what happened in that hours? i am no stranger to drugs and used to be addicted to various pi wills, but i stopped that, except i found some in my room in a baggie, i am sure they must have been from a long ti ame ago because as far as i know i have not relapsed, but the tablets i found are consistent with blackouts. what if i found them, took them, and forgot? am i even clean anymore? what if i am so far gone that i actually went out and got them and forgot? then i really would be going insane. i threw the rest down the toilet and in the week since, i have no found anymore or missed any ti ame, which is a relief. but anyway, on that saturday i started convincing myself something was wrong. i would missed a shift without calling in because i had fallen asleep for hours or so i hope i was asleep , and i would been late earlier that week too. first i thought i was going to get fired. i had texted my boss after two days to say i am sorry i did not respond, but that i was embarrassed for missing my shift and would explain later. when i came in, it is like he did not know what to do with me, and put me on an easy department. i would thiscussed with my friend and colleague on watsapp how my body was not used to the heavy lifting i would been on holiday for two weeks, and after my first week back i was really struggling to do the things i would gotten used to i work shelf stocking at a grocery store , and i would told hi am i was used to certain areas. suddenly my boss put me on those areas and the usual guy who did them, put hi am elsewhere. so i convinced myself he had read my messages with my friend. he was looking at ways to fire me. the colleague on the aisle near me kept coming round to do bits on my aisle, and i was completely convinced he was watching me. to this day i sti will think he was. in fact that whole day was off, and ever since my colleagues have not been treating me the same, like they have all been let in on something that i do not know. am i being investigated? did my counsellor worry so much that she got in touch? i kept overhearing whispers and people looking at me. walking home that night i spotted several people driving past, people i never see. three people offered me lifts, i even took a half hour detour scared out my mind there would be people at my house ready to section me or something. i was having a full blown paranoid episode. and i swear i have never felt that way in my entire life. i have felt thisconnected, almost like i am not real someti ames, but never like that. i finally made my way home and my flatmate was there, by the door. then i convinced myself she was in on it, whatever it was, and i kept hearing the door going every seconds and people talking or whispering. my two flatmates were downstairs watching tv together and they literally never do that. i kept locking my door every ti ame i went to the bathroom because i thought maybe they were going to search my room. for what? i have no clue . i sti will do this, even though it is been days. the next day was no better. the girl he normally puts on the aisle i was put on, was told she was going to take me off at am. i overheard this conversation with a colleague, but when i asked her if she was on there at all, she said no. this girl was then in the staffroom when my boss told me to go up and get my ti will code because i would be on ti wills for a bit. so, naturally, i convinced myself she was up there spying to see what locker i had my bag in. i do not know where that idea had come from, but the night before, i had felt so confined by the fact that i was never left alone, even on my breaks where i would received texts like where did you go? when i went to the toilet, i escaped when my colleague left my aisle, and ran upstairs to the toilet. as i came back down, i bumped into my boss, who had been nowhere to be found for an hour before that, and by bumped i mean literally bumped. as in he was running. he stumbled backwards onto the stairs. i laughed, and it is even funnier thinking about it now, but it was so foreign to me. why did he happen to be running up the stairs like a minute after i would gone up? am i just making this all up in my head? i came out of my room yesterday properly for the first ti ame in a couple of days and walked past my flatmate. i decided to actually speak to her because this whole paranoid running in and out thing, as well as not eating anything, was not helping. if i was going to get hospitalised i was not helping the issue by hiding out and locking my door and having the worlds quickest shower in case someone was trying to break in. so we spoke, and then we really spoke. for hours we chatted, and i felt so much better. i would also gone for a long walk to my local park, and although i was convinced i would seen the same car driving around and that the man with the dog was watching me, i had thismissed it by the end of the day. and am feeling a lot more able to do things today. i ate dinner yesterday, after realising i have lost almost a stone in the past month lbs . then i have eaten today and had two decent sleeps in a row. no random pi wills, no missing ti ame, and i have rearrange my therapy appointment and got my doctor to write a note for my missed shift last week. it is terrifying to me to have these kind of paranoid thoughts. i have always been kind of a conspiracy sort of person, but never the sort of conspiracy that might involve myself. i see the world as a cold dark place someti ames but i have always surrounded myself with the warmth of my friends and family. so to be seeing as my friends and family and co workers plotting against me, or convincing myself i am hearing things etc. has been a new and scary place. i do not ever want to be that far gone ever again. the worst thing is i am sti will not completely convinced i was i amagining everything. there is something up at work. maybe it is just that they have noticed my erratic behaviour and that in turn is causing more. i have texted my boss on two occasions now asking for a sit down to chat about anything he might want to talk about, and in response he has not replied, and has been avoiding me, yet everybody else seems to be constantly around. god what a hellish experience. could this be because of a depressive episode? or worse? maybe there really is something wrong. i wi will let you know if i get sacked or something. then my delusions may have not been delusions after all,haha.	moderate

i want to vent about my loneliness i feel extremely lonely. i thought it was boredom at first, but then i realized it was loneliness. my schedule is different compared to my university classmates. at most i see them to hours a week while they see each other the entire day, everyday. that is not enough ti ame for me to develop friendships or connections when i have about mins to talk to people before class begins. then i move on when class is over because i have to be at a different class and the cycle begins again. someti ames when i catch them during free ti ame i become friendlier. usually that ends when everyone has to leave to attend their different schedules. i smile, i laugh. something feels missing about it though. i can talk, but i do not feel a strong connection. i feel like they just respond because they have to. there is no mutual understanding other than the superficial niceties that is expected of us. anyone just have a talk with a psychologist just to vent? like i just want to release my frustrations on loneliness. but i do not think it wi will be the same. it is just paying someone who does not want to be there listen to me talk. i hunger for someone i can connect with. i workout, but that is just the physical part of venting. giving the extra push is nice and all, but once i have recovered from my exhaustion i come back to the realization that i am alone.	moderate

reading chat history from years ago is my only way of feeling warmth i have nobody now she used to care about me and we talked everyday for years until she just showed her true self last year and ditched me. it sti will hurts even today and i sti will think of her every night before i sleep. when i read the chat history i would obviously feel kinda sad..like it is so long ago..and she is no longer the person in that chat history.. but when i just feel very lonely after days of feeling zero affection and life does not seem like it is going anywhere because i have not really found a direction in life yet, that is when i feel the urge to read them, to kinda warm me inside and remember that i was not always this lonely, i used to have someone that i could share anything to, someone that is waiting for me to watch a movie together or play a game together, and for years, it felt like she became a part of me, that i could i amagine her voice whenever i feel lonely that i now longer could after she lost interest at me for about a year now. someti ames i think of how great it would be....if she could just come back and be part of my life again. all this misery that i been living with for about a year now would just go away, and life wi will be back to normal. the sun would actually feel like it is shining again, not just only feeling it on the surface but within me too. i would actually have something to look forward to again after a day of struggle as a person with asperger s, and usually what i look forward to when i get home is to just get on the pc and play games or watch a movie with her. and i would not have to feel lonely at night or when i just wake up. it honestly feels like life is going to be like this forever now.	moderate
dying would probably solve all my problems i do not want to get into it really but i just feel like if you think about it if i just died i wouldn t have to worry about anything i wouldn t have these thoughts pretty much everything would be fine like just an eternity of sleep idk i just feel like it would be more of an upside than anything else the only thing that stops me is the thought of how my parents would feel they would feel horrible and i wouldn t wish that feeling on anyone	moderate

hitting close to home hey, this definitely is not a big thing and it feels almost trivial, but recently my skin has been breaking out possibly due to hormones and other chemical stuff , and i make it worse by picking the pi amples or squeezing them too early a habit i have developed from my anxiety depression is picking or having to always have my hands moving, or any other part of my body moving. the pickings been getting especially bad recently, and tonight at the dinner table it is just my parents and i my mum reminded me to stop picking and my dad said to my face, completely bluntly and quite harshly, you should go to a doctor, your skin looks unnatural and wrong . and it hit a lot harder than i was expecting. i have become self concious, so much so that i have begun wearing makeup daily which i never normally do did to lessen how bad my skin looks to others. my reaction was just a gri am acceptance. like yeah, i get it, you do not think i look at myself every day and mentally abuse myself for my self destructive habits?? i absolutely hate myself for it and i wish every day i was not like this, but here i am, never having any inch of self control to stop it. i just need some advice. also a place to vent i am sorry to anyone who is read this, you do not have to reply but just being able to express my thoughts somewhere moderately safe is good for me right now. i am seeing my therapist tomorrow thank god 	moderate

i think i failed just found out that someone i was friends with is a successful artist. the guy i like is an up and coming but wi will be a successful artist as well. and i am about to lose my home. i have no friends and no future because i do not have anything to work towards. i am so happy for them because they are talented and are incredibly hard workers. just frustrated with myself. my stomach feels like it is twisting up ready to swallow me. i have been in my room the past couple of years. i cut most people off or we stopped being friends. not like i was popular to begin with. i can not keep up with the people i admire d the most. i can only watch the birds fly and hope for wings. but sti will, i am supposed to keep going. i did not sleep all night because i am avoiding something in particular. it is pathetic. i am mean and irritated most of the ti ame, i do not say the right things or act appropriately. i am si ample and easily manipulated and easy to forget. and then i wi will be gone and that ll be it. i feel more pressure because people believed in me and thought i could do something with myself but i did not and would not. the person i wanted to be exists so i do not feel like i can take up an i amportant space. i just came to be because two people that hate each other acted selfishly.	moderate

the best way in my opinion to want to ki will yourself but also have the probability to change your mind the only thing is, you need a revolver with whatever chambers you like, because you can put bullet in and every day, you spin it and pull the trigger, if you dont succeed the first day, the probability that you try a second ti ame is extremely low. also this post doesnt encourage suicide, this is just for the people who can not be convinced not to ki will themselves	moderate

i feel lost it feels like i am driving down a long, dark road with a tunnel that has a light at the end but i can not seem to reach it. my wi willpower and motivation is pretty much non existent, like i am seriously doing my best but it seems like nothing. my anxiety and depression is literally debilitating and i wouldn t wish this upon anybody. this is an everyday struggle for me from the moment i wake up to the second before i fall asleep. my mind feels like it thinks at mph. i am only and it is just so crazy to me that i go through so much deep emotional pain. it does not seem normal. why do i have to be so young going through so much? it really sucks and it is so unfortunate that i have to live with this. it is back and forth too, one moment i am happy and life is amazing, and then the next i feel like the world is over. it is a vicious cycle for me and i really need to figure it out. the fact that i have to go through almost desperate measures to feel like a normal human being is so frustrating. it does not come easy for me at all. it gets really tough maintaining a happy i amage around my peers when deep down i am struggling tremendously, but i have been doing this shit for so long that i just have no other option but to push through. i feel a lot of pressure especially in my age group and on social media that it literally drives me crazy and i just want to go ghost. i overthink to the core. i want this shit to be over already. i am really working on it though. and i do have faith in a brighter future. i love you redditors.	moderate

please help. i do not know if i can do this i do not know what happened to my life. things were always shit from the start tbh. my dad was a severe alcoholic and my whole family struggled with that for so many years, and after several instances of trying to take his own life he finally got the help he needs and is doing so well with his recovery. it was only years ago i truly realised how badly my mother was always behaving and how she was demoralising the family in her efforts to control, control, control. my dad is off alcohol now, and has been for a while, but my mother refuses to admit that she is not well or that she is abusive. she sends hi am the most poisonous vile messages and threatens to leave with us kids all the ti ame, and it is ki willing me. my dad has got bad heart problems and has had strokes, so he is not well in his body or mind , but he works hi amself to the bone to provide for us, but my mother just sucks the enjoyment and life out of everything we do. they have had marriage counselling so many ti ames, but it does not do shit. mum sti will believes the problem is sti will dad, it is dad, it can not be anything else. dad has said to me so many ti ames about how is he is worried about what he is going to do, whether he wi will pick up drink again pr actually mange to ki will hi amself this ti ame. school has just gotten a lot harder for me as well , so gcse s , i am usually a straight a is student, but i can not concentrate, my grades are slipping, and i am thisappointing everyone who cares about me. i have mentioned to others about how i can not carry on but people just think i am being dramatic or overreacting. my younger sister almost had a meltdown at school so she stayed with someone for weeks but my mother just freaked out and blamed my dad. i can not get out of this pit, what can i do? i have been considering suicide and i am so scared. sorry this is so long, i just need to say it. i have tried childline but it did not help at all. i just need to speak to someone.	moderate
what the actual fuck is the point is there really any point in living beyond , happiness is no longer there, any happiness there is is just feeling like less shit. bi wills, loans, everything makes you feel stuck, then you re suddenly alone in a small apartment you used to share with people who gave you some inner warmthy feeling, theyre no longer there, its just the emptiness, your body feels heavy, you eat all the ti ame but you can not even taste the food, there is no point in going out because theres no friends, you think that you should not commit suicide because playstation is coming later this year and might have some good games, then you get reminded that no, you dont feel anything from games either anymore, you have no income, can not get a job, sex doesnt feel like nothing but stress anymore, there is never anything new or anyone new, everything is just a hassle, you can not go to your siblings because theyre a bunch of sosiopaths and psychopaths who just want to knock you further down, there is no point in making more music because you allready lost all the fans you once had, you can not watch porn for escapism because that is a sin, and sin wi will only give you more grief, you look like someone else than you think in your head, your body is getting heavier, you look at a beautiful year old girl who looks so stunning that it makes your heart feel a stinging pain and you think hey atleast i feel something, and then you hate yourself for thinking a year old girl is beautiful in the first place because you are too much of a pussy to talk to her anyway, and even if you did you know you would fuck it up somehow and you are years older than her you fucking pathetic looser. i could go on and on. sorry for this rant but fucking piece of fucking shit why do i always say sorry for everything i fucking hate everyone and i am failing at being a christian just like i fail at everything i am a fucking failure maybe i desverve being stuck in this realm where satanic puppets run the show, whats the point of anything anymore, theres only pain all the ti ame, someti ames less pain, but always pain, i miss my mother.	moderate
felt good writing this, just to get it off my chest idk i am the fucking laughing stock of my school. i do dumb shit and act retarded in a pathetic attempt to gain social acceptance because i am too fucking insecure to act myself around my peers. it is like every day i go to school i put on this mask and play a character for everyone is amusement. i do it because it paints this i willusion that people actually like me cus they laugh at the shit i do but really they are making a joke out of me and think of me as the weird kid . i have a small circle of about friends and while i am able to act myself around them, i sti will feel outcasted cus they view me as the pushover of the group. they are always insulting me and physically abusing me but to them it is all just a bit of fun. there is been two occasions where i have decided to retaliate to my friends abuse. the first ti ame, my friend drenched me with a hose when we were hanging out in his backyard and so i responded by putting his jacket under a running sink. he then proceeded to punch me in the face until my nose was bleeding and i walked home, my clothes sti will soaking wet. the second ti ame was when my friends took my hat during lunch and wouldn t give it back so i took one of their hats. the guy whose hat it was tackled me to the ground and punched me ti ames in the back of the head. never even got my fucking hat back. it is not just physical abuse either, when my friend bought me lunch this one ti ame i said i would pay hi am back as soon as i could but apparently i was taking too long so my entire friend group decided i was not allowed to hang out with them on weekends until i would paid back double the amount i originally owed. i have fallen into a deep depression and as a result my grades have plummeted drastically. ive been told by teachers that if i do not sort out this problem i have to repeat year or leave the school. the worst thing about all of this is that i take my anger out on my parents. we argue on a regular basis and my episodes often result in me punching holes in the wall or breaking stuff around the house. the worst argument me and my parents had ulti amately led to me punching my mum in the arm, quite hard. i am such a fucking shitty human being that i resort to breaking my parents shit and hitting my mum when i get mad. i fooled myself into thinking it is my parents fault for all my life problems but now i realise all they want is for me to succeed and be happy. i treat good people such as my parents like shit because i dont want to take blame for my own actions. i have now added drugs into the mix having done acid and molly several ti ames as well as regularly smoking weed. i am so sick of this stupid fucking life. i am a shit stain on this planet i fucking hate myself and this world i am so sick and tired of everything. i have considered suicide many ti ames but the thought of how my family would react always scares me out of it. shit i am crying right now lol thinking about it. i need help.	moderate

a cry for help laying in bed at am. it is a normal wednesday but this wednesday i feel hopeless. why do i feel hopeless?i hate being this person. i am so lost. it feels like no matter how many ti ames i build myself up and those around me do as well everything falls back to where it was. i feel as if there is something wrong with my brain. i feel like i burden everyone around me. why should anyone have to constantly worry about their friend,daughter,girlfriend,etc.. i am on a ledge of a sea of self doubt,self hate, self pity...it feels like things would be better for other people if i was not here. no one would have to worry about supporting me or making sure i am okay. people would forget with ti ame heal. i have only affected a number of lives in the years of being alive but nothing dramatic. there is also bi willions of people on this earth and bi willions more to come. who wi will remember in the end that i struggled and lost? no one, realistically. this is not necessarily a goodbye post more of a holy shit wi will this feeling ever end post.	moderate

why do i hate myself recently i have been feeling so low and depressed and it has somehow taken to me a stage where i really hate myself. i really do not know it this all began in the first place. even though i am not the most outgoing to partying kinda person i have always found happiness being alone for most of the ti ame, but nowadays the kinda thoughts that are coming to me when i am alone are really sad and depressing. i get this weird sadness inside my head whenever i am alone or thinking too much, i do not why or what i am sad about and i am feeling like it is sucking out all the energy in me. i have been pushing people away from me recently, even if i am si amply sitting in my room and some one calls me to go out i lies and gets out of it. i have been doing this for a long ti ame now, i am not finding it rewarding going places. later i regret about sitting home depressed. also the fact that the life we re living is zero significance has struck me really bad i always feel like i am so insignifican not that people might not miss me even if i am not present and i think that is why i am pushing people out of my life and missing crowded gathering because of me feeling lonely or feeling like i am being ignored. there is a lot of ti ame i feel like there is no point in living this life but i am too afraid to take my life also. the only think that is keeping me alive is the thought that me taking my life is going to effect my parents and sister really bad. i have not talked about all these things going on in my head with anyone else i have been thinking of asking for some help here for a long ti ame too.	moderate

i feel so alone i have friends and family but i sti will feel lonely all the ti ame. i am graduating college this year and i feel like i wasted my last chance to have a good social life and meet people. i have been single for five years and i am at the point where i feel like i wi will never find someone. all my friends are making connections, getting jobs, getting out of town, doing good things with their life, being good at things, having relationships, having sex, and i am not doing any of those things. i am sad every day and i do not know how to better myself. i have hobbies and interests but i have no idea how to apply myself to them and actually use them to meet people. now i am graduating college and i feel like i wi will never have a chance to meet people or date or have fun again. i am working on getting a therapist but in the mean ti ame what do i do how do i stop feeling like this? i look around and all i see are people who are better than me in every way. i have no value or worth to anyone i am basically a piece of shit and i hate myself. lately i can not even hold a conversation with anyone i am just silent even with people i am close to and i never know what to say. i just want the pain to end.	moderate
i really want people to know that the contraceptive pi will can cause serious depression i am not trying to thiscourage anyone from taking the pi will as it can be an amazing form of contraception, as i thought it was for me and i raved about it for almost a year. but if you re taking it and you have symptoms of depression it really could be contributing. i started taking the pi will about a month before starting university so at first thought i was just homesick and unhappy and being out of my comfort zone. it was not until over a year later that i saw an article that really made me think. i can not describe the level of unhappiness i felt whilst on the pi will. i would dread getting out of bed, gained a lot of weight from comfort eating, would cry at random points for no apparent reason and after a while had serious thoughts about ki willing myself. what i could not understand is why because i felt like i had no reason to be unhappy. i had great friends and family, a loving boyfriend, i was doing well in my degree so why did i feel so low? it was only when i decided to stop the pi will that i noticed how much better i felt in myself. it scares me what the pi will did to me and what might have happened if i had stayed on it. so i just want people on the pi will to be aware of what it does and how much research there is out there linking depression to the pi will. i was in a place where i would try anything to be happy again and although i can not say i am smiling , i feel like the dark cloud hanging over my head has gone and i want to enjoy life as much as i can.	moderate

life so far so, uh, this is my first post on this sub and i kinda want to talk about how i have been dealing with life and depression just going to toss a trigger warning just incase basically i am in my freshman year of college and i am taking a very rocky hit. yesterday, i had a really bad thispute with family and it is like everything just became extremely numb. i know how it feels to be depressed in the past. i was extremely depressed and isolated in middle school due to bullying. that isolation and rejection became a gateway to anger. just complete rage. and now it fizzled out. i also have adhd, which makes things so much harder to actually do. i feel like every class is a burden. i constantly fall back every ti ame. i have no motivation for anything. i just curl up on my bed and lay there. i have some amazing friends but it is already scary thinking about opening up to them with my own personal problems. and my family makes me feel the worst. since i am the eldest sibling, i always had this expectation to do more. my depression gets in the way of everything and i want it gone. i get irritable and upset so quickly that even my younger siblings have noticed it. i feel like everyday, i am letting everyone and everything down. like i wi will never succeed in any of the dreams and aspirations i have. if i am going to constantly get stuck like this, what chances do i even have in the future?	moderate

i do not know what is wrong with me and i want help i feel miserable all the ti ame yet i have gotten all that i wanted. i am no longer living with my mother, and i have not for months. we never had a good relationship and i blame her for that. i never expected to move out to my grandmother is at , years earlier than i had expected. that should make me happier, yet it does not. i have stopped waking up scared of family drama kicking off and instead i just wake up with a feeling of nothingness. like why do i bother getting up? i honestly do not know why though. why can not i just be grateful for one thing. and right now i am scared if this feeling of hollowness is permanent. like am i just going to feel like this forever or is it just a rough patch that can happen with puberty and hormones. the only ti ame i ever really feel better is when i am talking to the people. and the feeling lasts for a while and that is good. but then i just go back my default state of feeling nothing. i do not think i have depression, but this feeling of chronic misery has been stuck to me for months now. maybe i deserve this?i know i can be a prick someti ames. i have never considered suicide, i would really consider myself quite functional. but i just do not know what to do with this feeling. am i depressed? or am i just an example of how our current society is reliance on social media and the internet just isolated me from my peers, causing unwanted feelings of misery. i just want it to stop and i wi will take any advise to make it stop at this point.	moderate
completely lost recently i graduated and started working but i lost that job pretty fast, i did manage to land another better paying one but the map i had built is completely destroyed and this caused a chain reaction and me seeing myself without a road, not just in professional settings but in everything. i felt that everything was working out just as planned, i was deceiving myself, but the lost of the job and change of setting has made a whole mess. i do not know who i am anymore, i have always struggled with my gender and sexuality but now, i feel like i am a dot with no line, i do not know what i want out of life, i do not know what to do cause i do not even know the question i am looking an answer for. i looked online and graduate depression is common, but its not that i miss school is that i thought i had some things figured out but it turns out i was lying to myself, and i completly and utterly lost. i do not know how to find a path if i do not know what path i am looking for, it feels like i am surviving and not living . i do not think there a easy fix solution for this but i needed to share it in order to lighten the burden. for a little bit of context i am , diagnosed with a general anxiety thisorder and minor depression. i am medicated for this and it works most of the ti ame, but it does not help with this identity crisis or whatever this is. i do not know what i expect from this post or if anyone wi will read it and care, but i do not know what else to do, i can not even begin to explain it someone even if i wanted to, which i do not anyway.	moderate

leaving secondary school has made me depressed please listen this needs to get off my chest, sorry reddit for having to bare this. for background information, i was in a secondary school uk year old. in year my last year i had a blast, i had at least people who i knew well and got on with, i had a girlfriend in another school who i am sti will with , i had another people out of school i seen every weekend, and i had my science friends who i did not see out of school ever, roughly of them year was so so fun, me and my friends had so much fun in school and out of school, we went out every single weekend, it was so fun. we mixed with people from other towns as well. then after gcses were done, and the new academic year started, i decided to stay at sixth form leaving me just with my science friends. everyone else had gone to college or another sixth form. do not get me wrong i like my science friends but did not have that bond with them anything like my other close friends that left. what was once , is now . yes i have friends left now, who i do not even see outside of school. not only that, but all of my close friends and the others from other towns have all drifted apart, stopped speaking as much and no one goes out anymore, it is literally as if my life has declined dramatically since i started sixth form. whenever we try and organise a get together it never works, no one wi will commit to it. so it is not even a case if i can sti will see my friends on the weekend, because i can not. i sti will have really close friends who i see often, but it is not the same as socialising in one big group. sixth form is a drag too. i am sti will with my girlfriend thank god, probs the only thing keeping me going, i see her a lot. but even then it is not the same. she used to come out with everyone too and that was so much fun and we bonded so well. i can not stress it was so good with everyone coming out and socialising but now it is literally as if life has died and my social life has gone out of the window. i am sti will doing sports but i do boxing, which is a lonely sport anyway. i know i can not turn back the ti ame but i needed this off my chest and any advice would be greatly appreciated, i do not even want to go uni because i am very social and can suspect the people there wi will be like my science friends . it is like i am ai amlessly and lonely living just for the sake of it, with no goal in site. no social life, and i miss my past life. sorry reddit. p.s. i never talk about my feelings, i am very closed, never want to open up, ever. but i can not help it, it is been like this for months and not sure how long i can go. thankyou	moderate
suicide is not the easy way out. getting murdered cancer dying of old age is the easy way out. because at least then, your family people who knew you do not have to mourn the fact you robbed them of your life. you do not have to go through with murder ki willing yourself . and you do not have to go through with the anguish of self doubt as you do it. sounds easier to me. so i am taking the easy way out. i am going to rot here, doing nothing with my life, and wait until i die of a thisease or something.	moderate

not sure what to do i have been diagnosed with anxiety for many years now, but it is only recently that i have started to have suicidal thoughts. i moved to the place known as the uk nearly years ago now, and if i am honest, that is probably the point where my life started to turn south. i was quite shy and struggled to make friends sti will struggle with that, but that is not the point which probably caused me to feel alone, especially with my brother moving out and my parents never really there at work . i really do not know what caused me to feel like this recently when i managed to cope with everything for years before this. it is having an effect on other stuff as well, mainly my grades, which is causing my parents to worry even more about me which i do not want them to be. therapists i have been to have never really helped, but i do not think i can carry on trying to help myself while my physical and mental health deteriorates.	moderate

what is an instant most efficient way to ki will myself? do not give a fuck anymore. i am going to hell anyways, i have done no good to anyone. please can someone give me advice? i have searched everywhere on google, all it shows are blogs of how to not ki will yourself. i do not care where my soul is going to go. my religion is buddhism but i am trying my best to think positive and see that this depression is my karma for what i have done to other people in my previous lives. so yeah, i deserve to just finish this life today. just finished another minutes of full on crying again. i can not handle this any longer. my parents do not think my emotions are i amportant, so i guess they wi will not care if i ended my life today. it wouldn t affect them much because i am complete shitless and useless to them. everyday and everywhere i go, i feel like a damn demon, it is like everyone else around me growls and gossips around and at me. i feel like i have really done something to them to deserve this. i just want to die so that they would feel less threatened. and to be honest, i feel a bit calmer after typing this down. thank you for taking your ti ame reading my rant. i hope you have a nice week.	moderate

ignore been suffering from deep depression for a couple of years, before that it was manageable and did not consume everything. i just can not see when it wi will start getting better, i can not find the motivation and capacity to do normal people things. i can not make appointments, i can not go to the shop without severe anxiety, i can not write a cv or a cover letter to apply for jobs, i could not finish my degree that i spent years studying. i sti will feel like having my ex back would make me feel validated and loved, hoping it would kick start my life but i know now she would not ever come back because good things do not happen to me and even if they do i would ruin them. the solution to my problem may seem very obvious to some of you and that is awesome but i have zero reason to live or lack of wi will to live. zero ambitions zero dreams. i just feel like if i could get my ex back then i would be happy again and i would feel good about myself. automatically your brain wi will say no that is toxic and not how it should be but how do i explain that its how i feel inside and can not budge from it and how low it makes me feel when i think of her. i haveost my identity and truly feel like i can not make it through life alone and without her. i smoke in the hopes of getting cancer and then i can finally be free from this suffering, wish me luck. thank you for reading.	moderate

lowly thoughts wyatt m i do not know what to do anymore. no one said life was easy but i never thought it would be this hard. i have lost my family to death, thistance, and hardship. i work hard trying to get out of this hole but i find myself deeper in debt, isolation, and this system of things. i can not afford professional help of any kind, whether it be therapy, general healthcare, or even vision to get myself a new prescription. i am blind in one eye and legally blind in the other, and i am on my last contact that i have been wearing for months. i am trying to take care of my spouse and i. i work full ti ame and all the money i have goes to rent and bi wills, and someti ames its not enough. i live in reno nevada where the livable wage is an hour and those jobs are full or out of reach. i bought a car to close the thistance, and it broke down a week later. the only thing i have left is my partner and were falling apart amidst it all. it seems like the worlds on my shoulders, and i am barely holding on. it keeps getting progressively worse...	moderate

depression is a bitch!!! most days are unbearable, other days feel empty and alone. i feel like a burden to everyone around me, especially those closest to me. i can not stand being alone with my thoughts, constantly feeling the need to thistract myself but find it hard to focus or get into anything. i am eager to feel comfortable with myself again. wanting to just feel better already. i often waver the idea of suicide in my thoughts, though i know i could not bring myself to do. i have responsibilities and wouldn t want to hurt the people close to me. i do not want to give up... though i worry if change does not happen soon, my body wi will take me out. it is gotten so bad that i get sick easily from the anxiety and stress itself. it is been this way for so long now, it is hard to condition my body and mind to snap out of it. i know what changes need to be made to get better. however, it seems that once i have a foundation going something happens and i am set back. question. what keeps you going when you feel defeated?	moderate

i am convinced there is something wrong but i do not know how to get help for a while i have been struggling with or at least i think i have been some sort of mental i willness and the only one i have found that matches me perfectly is depression. at first i did not think anything of it, but recently it has gotten much worse. i constantly feel like just switching my life off and i know it sounds common but i feel very empty and deprived of emotions. i live with my family which stops me from self harming, however i weirdly crave it and have resorted to doing it a few ti ames. i am not going off this but many ti ames i have looked up symptoms of depression and i relate to them all. i wouldn t do it, but most days i feel like dying or just stopping my life for a while and have thought of how good it would be to go into a coma or something like that. however, i do not know how to say anything and i have not told anyone at all about any of this. many people my age joke about these things so even if i told someone i trust i am sure they would just think i am over exaggerating and wouldn t believe me. and even if i did say something i wouldn t want my family to worry so i am just stuck and do not know what to do. i would appreciate someone who has dealt with this to help or help me find out what i have, if i do have anything.	moderate

hi, new in town hope i do not break any rules talking about this. i did not find another sub mentioning it. i need to come to terms with the fact i could have mild functioning depression. i saw articles where it is called dysthymia. when talking mental health i have always felt so small compared to cases much more extreme than mine. though, i think i am not shooting towards some good in my life at the ti ame being. my career seems like a joke, i do not like it, and i certainly do not admire the people in upper management, do not want to replace them either. this industry was good while learning it in masters degree, but now it just feels bland. quality control and sales figures just ki willed it. as they would ki will anything else i want to do. as a result, i do not feel proud of what i do at job, i just do it. my hobbies are kind of on hold because there is no energy left to make them live after a day of work. actually, at none of them i am proficient, i am just trying to educate myself. and these are so niche i do not find like minded persons irl. internet has become my echo chamber. i have always had too much hobbies. i would not define them as copes, more like genuine interests i would avidly develop, given ti ame to do so, without worrying too much about money earnings. my girlfriend is supportive, but she is supporting me in the wrong way, saying things like you re ki willing it at job, you wi will be a great executive later which i do not want to hear. i would have loved hearing i wi will become a good music composer. but that is wrong because people who have done art stuff since childhood with parents support, are miles ahead from me and i can not get the kickstart i would wish ti ame off art school or student life. because i need to pay the damned bi wills. my family was dysfunctional due to a hateful divorce between my parents, it took years and it is sti will not over. i seldom get extremely dark thoughts because i keep myself busy, but this existence holds no good future as long as i have to finance an average lifestyle with an average job, living a life that is not really mine. i am angry at society because there are a number of ways to heal from depression there, but the only one that truly works is not allowed. the cure is finding a meaning to life again, and not encountering unconquerable obstacles. i consider my bank account an unconquerable obstacle. paying really is an overrated action, if you wi will hear me. thanks for reading up. i may not thisturb you any longer. good luck to all the people over here who have it harder.	moderate

february , i feel like i needed to post to at least vent and be able to move on at least a bit. i have been going through some of the worst years of my life with my depression and honestly feels as if it is never getting better. i have been a sexual assault survivor and since then my depression has hit dangerous levels. i have been diagnosed with ptsd and borderline bipolar thisorder..i am losing motivation for everything i used to love. i recently lost about pounds due to diet exercise and you d think the healthy lifestyle would be something that helped but at this point all it created was an eating thisorder. i have tried therapy i tried self medicating with cannabis but then everyone says i am like a zombie. but when i am high i actually feel feelings. i do not want to rely only on cannabis anymore. but someti ames my anxiety and depression have been such an issue i can not sleep. i went hours without sleep and i had to force myself to sleep. i know the usual go to answers are finding a doctors help but even someti ames i feel like it is never enough.. has anyone been there?.. i feel so alone	moderate
how the hell am i supposed to talk about my problems when theirs are worse i only have one person to talk to on a day to day basis. it is made me so, so absurdly lonely because i can only talk when they are available, but they are someti ames occupied by other people or activities. i want to talk to them so badly. i want to tell them how lonely i am, or how i feel, but i do not want them to feel bad for having friends, i do not want them to feel bad for not talking enough because i can see they make a large effort and i am the one who can not seem to accept that as enough. and what is more, is that they are also depressed. their problems seem so much worse than mine, which just creates this barrier. they talk about their daily problems quite frequently, so i never have much opportunity to talk about mine. i guess the best way to put it is that i crave some form of attention, even just the mini amal amount would be enough. i do not really know though, my mind is an utter mess most of the ti ame anyway.	moderate
i feel empty it is strange, since for several weeks i have just been feeling progressively worse and now it is like i feel nothing at all. i want to feel something, anything, i do not care if i feel terrible or great i just want to not be a void anymore. i do not see how i can keep living like this if it goes on any longer. it is like i am already dead anyway.	moderate
no motivation for anything it is hard enough staying awake through the day, let alone mustering up the energy to do anything but get high off my ass. everything i like or enjoy has turned into a medium for self hatred. i do not want to do anything but sleep.	moderate

i cope by i amagining the suffering has a purpose i have this irrational fantasy, that all this constant sadness i feel, the gnawing anxiety and uncertanty, the emptiness, the loneliness, worthlesness etc. at least entertains the gods whatever higher power in the universe. deep down i know, that it has no meaning and nobody cares. why would i deserve any care or attention when mi willions have it much worse than me? i have it so easy, i have a roof over my head, never went hungry, live in a first world country and even have the funds for occasional splurges. here i am, in a healthy body feeling sorry for myself, when mi willions suffer from uncurable ilnesses. i was born in an eu country, my birth alone gave me more opportunities for a happy life than of the worlds population, yet i squander it every single day, i feel miserable, yet i am deathly afraid to change anything. life is unfair, unfair because by virtue of my birth location, lazy filth like me have it a thousand ti ames better than most people on this forsaken planet could even dream about, yet i have the audacity to constantly feel sad and lonely. fuck me and fuck god random chance for this injustice of an existence.	moderate

it never seems to get better been unemployed since mid july of last year. i am continually searching for work, but have been unable to land a new job. i live alone, in a rental apartment i can not afford. my parents have helped support my rent, but unemployment is about to expire and, with sizeable debts and not prospects, i fin life more and more pointless. i am getting nowhere. my daily routine feels like a prison. nothing seems to pan out, and nothing i try is working. i do not know what to do, and am losing hope. nothing seems interesting worthwhile. what i usually take joy in no longer seems worth it. i am isolated from human interaction, aside from the relentless spam calls i get each day. i feel like i am heading towards a dead end, with no options. nothing seems to matter. i wish i knew what to do to make things better. i am sorry to post this nonsense. i hope you all are having things better than me. i never wish this hopelessness on anyone else.	moderate
after isolating, i feel awkward reconnecting. i need help. this is going to be a bit of a long post, but i want to give some context i have struggled with depression my f entire life. there are periods where my depression is debilitating complete loss of appetite for months, suicidal ideation, getting out of bed in the morning takes every last ounce of energy and there are ti ames where it is completely functional and i feel okay. i had a very bad downswing that started in the fall of , got a little better in the spring, got really bad again over the summer, and then became pretty unbearable in november of . i am only just starting to feel better after working with my doctor trying to find a medicine that works for me and starting to work with a therapist again. one of the ways depression hit me was that it made me want to isolate myself from my loved ones. i was not only ashamed of how i was feeling, but i was just really exhausted from pretending like everything was okay around other people. basically, i stopped responding to calls and texts unless i needed to respond like to coworkers . one of the people i isolated myself from was one of my best friends, whom i have known since college. i know that this is one of the people i should have felt comfortable talking to about my struggles. her mother in law, however, has also struggled with depression. i have listened to my friend make comments about her mil such as i wish she would just snap out of it, she is in control over her own mood, so it is her fault she feels this way, and i just do not understand depression. people should just get over it. it is made it very difficult for me to be able to open up to her about what i am going through. so i stopped responding to calls, texts, etc. and obviously she has stopped reaching out to me. i do not blame her. now that i am starting to feel some slight relief in my symptoms, i am wanting to reach out to her again. i feel really bad that i can not bring myself to do it. it is been over a year since we have talked. i feel embarrassed, and i feel like it warrants an explanation. i feel extremely bad about it now, because she recently announced that she is pregnant i found out through facebook . she was having a really hard ti ame getting pregnant and she is always wanted a baby, so this is really i amportant to her. i recently got an invitation to the baby shower i think that might be too much for me but i do want to reach out and congratulate her and maybe connect in person but one on one, but i feel stuck. thanks to anyone who read this far. has anyone else experienced something si amilar or have any advice for me? tl dr i became extremely depressed, isolated myself from everyone including my best friend who has made thisparaging comments about depression, but not i want to reconnect but am feeling too embarrassed and stuck to do so. halp.	moderate
an i amportant personal experience with medication hi everyone, this is lengthy, but i feel like it is a very i amportant thing to read for those newly seeking help or who are having issues finding what works for them. i would like to start by saying this i have struggled with depression since i was very young, and never sought the help i desperately needed. i told myself i have got this , it would not work for me , and the usual excuses not to seek help. i went well over a decade without doing anything about it, went through the suicidal thoughts those sti will exist, please keep reading and i was told by many to get help, but i just never could get myself to actually do it. while i was loud and proud with my struggles, making jokes, etc. i was too embarrassed to tell a professional. i do not know why, but i just thought they would give me a hard ti ame or not take it seriously. i have never been taken very seriously by a doctor for a lot of my life, but after seeing my newest pcp consistently for about months and feeling a level of comfort and trust, i decided on a whi am to mention it. he diagnosed me with clinical depression, and i was placed on zoloft. my stomach hated me for that, and i spent months on the toilet consistently. my head felt a bit more clear, and i knew medication had side effects, so i figured it was normal and that was the balance god was i wrong . finally, i told hi am, so round , we went with lexapro. i felt awesome. i had energy again. i was talkative and engaging in social behavior again, but this is where it gets interesting. on top of all these pleasant feelings, i had a new set of problems. my anxiety ramped up tenfold. my suicidal thoughts became even more serious, and i began making random, i ampulsive, mid priced purchases dollars . did not really even think about that much, i just thought i am feeling good for once, to hell with it! . i opened new credit cards within a month period. so, why am i telling you that part? well, due to my severely increased anxiety and suicidal thoughts, a friend of mine noticed something she saw in her brother, and told me i need to go to a psychiatrist i ammediately, because she thinks there is something else wrong. she expressed why she felt this way, and how seriously this needs to be taken, and that i am scaring her and everyone else. so, i did. a couple weeks later, i go to my appointment, and i come out with a completely different diagnosis bipolar ii. i was placed on lamictal, and within a week, the fog was lifted. i felt such relief. i began therapy, and i am here now, a couple months later, and i am fixing the damage done while on i amproper medication. the moral of the story here is, if you have problems and your first step that you feel comfortable with is to tell your pri amary care doctor, that is absolutely fine but monitor yourself. see what gets better, and if other things get worse, and make note of them. otherwise, you may find yourself dollars k in debt and damaging everything and every relationship you have, without ever realizing what you re doing. i empathize with all of you here, i know what depression does to you. i suffered for so long, and i am finally on a road to recovery. there is no shame in speaking to a professional about what is happening, and i can not express this enough and do not take this the wrong way if you think help would not work for you try it anyway. you have nothing to lose, and you may find that you re not as special as you think you are. it works for a lot more people than it does not work for. you re more likely to be the statistic of those it does work for. keep at it. please. and if you re curious about my account age no post history my main account has a bit too much pii and i figured this may be the ti ame to start using this one. if you read this far, thank you.	moderate
i can not do work, again in the past, my mental health issues have made me not do homework or revision, ever, but i would been actually doing the work for a few months, but now i literally can not do anything again. the prospect of just opening my folder and organising it is overwhelming and i just can not do it. and that makes me so anxious because my teachers wi will be pissed and i have already pissed them off lately for handing work in late, so i am screwed. i have tests and folder checks it is ridiculous for teachers to check the folders of year olds anyways ?? tomorrow, and i have not prepared for any of those things. it is too late to even start now, and i am a weird mix of stressed and apathetic, which probably makes no sense. the loss of motivation that depression brings absolutely sucks. and what is worse is how the depression and anxiety completely contradict each other, yet the one that screws me over the most in a given situation always seems to win, and someti ames they work together to make life hell. i am sick of it...	moderate
i am tired of this shit i am going to ki will myself this sunday and nobody can talk me out of it. i faked allergies to all my other acne meds so i can get accutane instead and overdose. there is nothing good in life anymore, i am just a year old girl stuck in this cycle. the only thing that matters to me is my girlfriend, she brightens my day and is like the light in the dark but we can never truly be together. our families hate eachother and i have not seen her for months. we talk on text everyday neither of us can sneak out as we have cameras on our doors windows etc. i wi will never be ab le to love her freely leaving the only thing that matters to me trapped behind a glass wall, there but untouchable. i can not tell her any of this because she is truggling with issues of hr own and i do not want to put more weight on her shoulders. i hate school , i used to be a gifted student now i have failing grades and i can not be bothered. i dont see the point of wasting your life just for a job and money that youll probably never be happy with anyway and it feels like we re just going through life rather than enjoy it. i hate my family and my friends, they ruin everything and only make my life miserable. my family shout at me for sh and refuse to get me any knd of therapy even though i ask pretty much everyday now. there is no way out except death and i am leaving. i do not know why i posted tis on here, i think i just need to get my feelings out to someone.	moderate
bane of life as a child i have always felt sad and alone, i grew up mexican american. with my brother and two sisters, both my parents emotionally absent. sure they loved me but i could never tell them how i felt. my mom was some what abusive and so was my dad. i never really had a problem with making friends, but i always did feel a little off, middle school was ok i had girlfriends and would hang out, apart from that that is when i started to smoke and drink, i thought it would numb how i felt but i never felt secure with my friends and gf, high school came along and it was like any other experience. the smoking and drinking got worse. i started experi amenting with drugs. it was around this ti ame that i had gotten my jaw broken by some older people for just walking and minding my business. it was tragic and i had to have surgery, my parents never really worried or ask how i was doing, they more than not got angry when i got hurt. my friends also never asked me and just never brought it up. i feel like i live with a darkness that swallows me whole, i am drinking as i write this for i am an alcoholic and i hate that. some days i just want to blow my brains out to stop the hurting. two of my close friend had commutes suicide that way. and at ti ame when i black out drunk, i fear that darkness wi will consume my soul.	moderate

i willusion or despair today i almost fell into a i willusion i created. i do not want to give away the i willusion i had, but it made me feel a little less crazy and depressed. but sadly i could not trick myself that easily, thanks to my constant second guessing. i realized what i was doing a bit too weird, and abnormal. but i thought everyone had there secrets, why can not i? why do i have to be an open book for every brain dead idiot who walks by to read? so i kept thinking and thinking. then i thought i already have enough secrets, like my depression,my ongoing battle to keep my sanity. i could not get over how low i fell. so what is better? being unrealistic, but happy ,setting your hopes up past the possible point you actually have,but happy i willusion or being realistic unhappy, but safe and sane? i know this is a hard question, a lot of stuff to weigh. sorry.	moderate

i have run out of steam i am m and i have struggled with depression since middle school. things would be going great in life but i would somehow always find something to be bothered by. as for most people, my life has been full of a lot of ups and downs. when my girlfriend left me about a year ago, i thought that i had hit rock bottom emotionally. i had to take some ti ame off from work to get my mind straight, i saw a therapist for a while. a lot of people assured me that i would bounce back to my good old self soon enough. i have always been a creative person. i love to write music. i have worked in the food amp beverage business for a long ti ame, and i loved being able to create new concoctions. my job allowed me a bit of creativity, however my boss would begin to shut down a lot of my ideas and would direct more and more negativity my way. i decided a long ti ame ago that i would one day want to work for myself. i have envisioned myself running a bar or a restaurant maybe, and how miserable i was at my current job. well now i have been unemployed for about days amp that motivation i used to have is just not there. i just lay in bed all day browsing reddit amp youtube, someti ames getting up to make a snack or play video games. someti ames i wi will go to the store for groceries. someti ames i wi will meet my mother for lunch on sunday, but aside from those things i have not left the house at all really. i used to have all kinds of friends to go do things with, and now that is not really a thing, and even if it were, i do not know that i would want to go do much. a cute girl has been trying to get together with me, but i politely decline and make up excuses. i feel like i do not have anything to offer anyone in a relationship right now, and that is ok, as i have decided that i want to focus on me for a little while md get my career amp mental health sorted out. i used to have these cool creative ideas all the ti ame and would often think to myself oh i wish i had the ti ame to get these projects started. now that i have nothing but ti ame, i have zero drive or energy. i am always procrastinating and saying oh i wi will get started tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and i just lay in bed until i get hungry at pm and decide to turn on the playstation, at which point i wi will probably play until am, get in bed and watch tv for two hours until i finally fall asleep. i suppose my question for this sub is what can i do to revive myself and get that positive amp productive energy flowing? i really wish i had someone to partner with for new startup projects someone to keep me on my toes, but that is not currently available for me. i need something to help set things in motion for me.	moderate

not suicidal but wishing for death wondering if anyone relates or has si amilar thoughts. i am not suicidal at least not right now , and i do not have a plan, though i do have ideations occasionally, usually about jumping off of a bridge. truly, i do not think i could do that to my family. but lately, i have been having a lot of thoughts about dying without ki willing myself, like suffering an aneurysm or choking in my kitchen, or having a heart attack or something. someti ames i wi will be driving past a tractor trailer and just think that they should slam into me. it feels like it would be so much easier to not exist without having to cause all the harm that suicide causes.	moderate
 motivation depression is a monster and you have to be one to survive it here is the sad truth about all living creatures, not everyone is born equal or even capable of surviving in this world as they currently are. someti ames we are born into situations that doom you to a life of misery and pain. there are so many people in this world suffering, life is not fair, and nature is trying to ki will us on a daily basis. no matter what life is going to throw its an incomprehensible amount of tragedy, hardship and wounds your way, everyone you wi will ever know and love wi will leave or die. you wi will lose everything that you have in this. in order to survive you most be able to sustain mortal wounds and massive losses, someti ames on a daily basis, because that is just how cruel this world is. depression is a monster and its goal is not to handicap you, its ai am is to ki will and you must become a monster to fight a monster. if you are reading this, then that is a testament to the strength that is deep within you. human beings have evolved for mi willions of years in order to get this far and experienced much more brutal circumstances, just because you never developed your dark side does not mean it is not there. we must not give into our fate, we have to rage until the dying of the light. be prepared for the greatest fight of your life, it does not matter how hopeless the situation is, if you are going to die, which we all wi will sooner or later, let us die fighting and show life that we wi will not be easy prey. once you accept your death, it wi will be easier to move despite the suffering you experience the anxiety, the pain and your inadequacies wi will cease to be your sole focus. one last thing, be prepared to lose or relinquish any attachments you hold on to. it is not uncommon that many of the beliefs, objects, desires, or people we hold on to that we believe to help us survive in this world actually become the root cause of our suffering. its like as nietzsche said you must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes? 	moderate
extreme depression i am at that point where i have whined unceasingly about the causes of my depression and no closer to having alleviated those causes thus i must accept my reality. but i just can not. it is like someone telling you to believe an object is yellow when really it is purple but no one wi will listen. you are forced to accept it as yellow. so for example you are in poverty and can not get employment no matter how hard you try. you know in your heart that you deserve better, that this circumstance was not supposed to happen, as though it were some error in fate. you do not feel free. you feel like a prisoner and no one wi will help you. you have no friends. nobody cares what happens to you ever again for the rest of your life. what do you do? or rather what should i do since these are my perceptions of myself? what can i do to change my situation? is there any option other than acceptance?	moderate
bloody tears i have a bad habit of picking at my wounds. today i stood in front of the sink after brushing my teeth clawing at a wound. blood started leaking out and it dried on my fingers. in an effort to try and boost my spirits and thistract myself i looked in the mirror and smiled. i liked to think i was good and putting on the happy act. that people could not tell what was wrong if i did not want to let them in. it does not work the way it used to. something else is broken now. all i could see was sadness in my eyes and in sucked me into this infinite loop of despair i was trying to avoid. i watched the tears form and fall down my face. god i hate my face. i watched the tears rise over the hi wills of my cheek bones and slip into the cavern of my lips never to be seen again. i went to wipe my face and had forgotten about the blood. now i am covered in these bloody tears.	moderate
i am alone. my mother just walked in on m e in the middle of a breakdown and yelled at me for it. i texted her and asked if she would take care of a chore for me and told her i was having some troubles. she came bathing into my room, saw me crying and shaking and proceeded to yell at me about the chore and said that it was bullshit that i lay and wallow in bed. like i can do anything about it. she always complains about how i never talk to her but every ti ame i try this is just the result. i ended up feeling even worse. i am beginning to feel like my girlfriend does not care about me, the whole almost months we have been together every ti ame i have asked her for help she dodged my plea like it was never there. my dad told me today, on the way to school, that he felt like my mother didnt love hi am anymore... ruined my day from the start and had my head running. from breakdown in class to breakdown at home i feel helpless. the amount of suicidal thoughts in my head grow daily and at a constant rate. my mental health is affecting my grades, i used to be a straight a student in all honors and ap classes and now i have f is and the year is closing in on me. i was already called a thisappointment by my father because of my grades and i am scared if i end the year like this i wi will not be able to live with myself. i dont know what to do, every plea for help, everybody i know just shoves me in this hole deeper than i already was. i can never play video games anymore which i used my entire life as a coping mechanism, i can not ever sleep because i struggle to do my homework with how much i have, balancing ti ame with my girlfriend, work, trying to play video games as much as i can for a bit of safety, and having to wake up every morning at am after going to bed at am on most nights if not later. it doesnt help that i have a sleep thisorder. i just dont know what to do.	moderate

 m sharing my story. freedom from severe depression! hello everybody. i just wanted to share my personal experience with major depression in the hopes that i may provide some inspiration, motivation to those that are struggling! this wi will be long, i would prefer not to summarize things! for nearly two decades, i had major depressive thisorder i felt completely overwhelmed by my depression. it ate up all my mental and physical energy, like a vampire within my own mind that i felt i could not get rid of. this affected my self worth, lowered my self i amage, and made me feel ashamed to interact with other people, because i was ashamed of myself, and i did not want anybody to see that part of me. therefore, i spent a lot of ti ame isolating myself from others and have had very few close friends that i felt i could be truly honest with. i saw numerous counselors, psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts, you name it. i tried different medications, and i even had neurofeedback sessions spread out across months. i was determined to become free, to live a better life. during those nearly two decades, i would try a new therapist, or new medication, or new workout routine, or new diet and in the beginning, it wouldn t work out the way i expected. often, i would find that most things just covered up the depression, but did not help permanently thissolve it. this led to a seemingly never ending cycle of building the courage to not lose hope, try something new to treat the depression, become thiscouraged or thisi willusioned that it was not working, then fall back into feeling victi amized by my depression and retreating into social isolation, using drugs, masturbation, unhealthy food and other thistractions as a placeholder for my sadness. as i continued trying new treatments for the depression, even if it did not work out the way i anticipated, with each new go, i was unconsciously feeding energy to a very thistant part of myself a self that had the wi will to be more, to feel and share joy with others. it was the pure, innocent and loving part of myself that had been buried by the momentum of nearly two decades of negative beliefs, thoughts and physical acts. ulti amately, in choosing to keep going and not give up, i was also choosing to acknowledge and listen to this part of my self. as a result, i was gradually chipping away at the depression making it more and more manageable, and less pervasive in my mind. although again, i was not conscious of this at the ti ame. i just want to let anyone reading this know that i genuinely felt for the longest ti ame that i was going to be depressed forever. i could not see a way out and thought of ki willing myself nearly every day of my life. and yet as i am typing this, i am experiencing more mental freedom then i could have ever i amagined. i would not be experiencing this if i had given up. i chose to keep going, even though i was afraid that i would fail again and become even more thiscouraged. eventually, i found the right therapist, the right medication, i thiscovered neurofeedback, and things began to click for me. it was not an instant process, again it was gradual. i can see now that my depression was just like a computer program that was projecting the same negative thoughts, beliefs into my mind. i realized that any specific belief or thought that repeats in my mind is not me the true being that i am is a creative being. i also realized that how i feel at any given ti ame is directly correlated with whether or not i have allowed these negative programs into my mind. but i can separate myself from these thoughts i can detach myself from these thoughts, i do not have to let these thoughts in. i can let them die, until the depression machine loses its stored energy, and thus loses its power over my mind and how i feel. once i started becoming more and more conscious of this i could detect the negative thoughts in my mind as they appear, and rather than being passive and allowing them in, or choosing to identify myself with these thoughts, i could go into a neutral state and instead choose to reject them. then, i could more easily tap into my positive, loving, opti amistic self. it is a lot like changing the channel to better one on a tv, except in my mind. although i am sti will struggling from ti ame to ti ame, the depression is way less prominent, and i have so much more hope and faith that things wi will get better. and if i can do it considering how hopeless i used to think things were, feeling like i was in a black hole of despair with no escape, and how many mistakes i have made that fed the depression then i truly believe that everybody has the capacity to do it. it is a process, of course... but the journey of a hundred miles begins with the first step!	moderate

its just a normality am i depressed? honestly i dont ever know. i have felt like this for such a long ti ame it has become my normal. waking up everyday and wanting to quite. holding back the tears talking to my parents. hating every aspect of my life. even the good aspects i find no happieness in. i constantly want to curl up in a ball and hide. avoid the world. it sounds so peaceful. i could just sit and cry by myself. alone hidden from the world with just my thoughts both dark and bright. i am ready to give up. i am ready for it to be over. i keep looking into the future thinking it wi will get better and this singular thought is what keeps me going. the problem is if i look into the past it has only gotten worse. the days were my body feels numb continue to rise. my mind seems to be constantly thistant from my body as if my body means nothing. i go through days on autopiolet. it seems as if i wake in my bed and all of the sudden i am back in my bed about to fall asleep. everything in my life is a blur with no substance. its become i ampossible to focus. si ample task seem monumental and sti will i have no energy to accomplish them. i feel like i am about to just fade into space and become nonexistant. why do i have to live like this? it sucks. everyday sucks. i just want it to change. i want to be happy so bad but it seems i ampossible. a good life is something i have given up on. i am purely here because it wi will hurt to many people if i wasnt.	moderate

i am spiraling, i am terrified, and i do not know what to do. hi... i am having a really tough ti ame and i have a few questions i am hoping someone can answer about checking myself into a hospital. or hoping someone can point me in the right direction of what to do. apologize for any formatting issues, i am on mobile and i am not thinking super clearly so this might be jumbled. i am having the toughest year of my life and i am really struggling to see how everything is worth it. i have been struggling with depression on and off for about years now. i tried to ki will myself when i was . but i have never gone to get help and my parents never took me to talk to anyone, they never knew i tried to ki will myself and when i brought up mental health issues they just told me i was going to be fine. last year, my mom who has a mi willion medical issues, and who died and was revived in front of me when i was almost died again in the hospital because she got septic shock. then a couple of months later my parents got into this bad fight where they dragged us all into it and the divorce bomb was dropped. it sounds stupid but it was traumatic because it felt like my family was being ripped apart both ti ames in different ways. between that, being overworked and highly stressed, it felt like a breaking point for me mentally. the next week all of a sudden they were fine and back together and everything was fine but i did not feel fine anymore. i have been doing so many i ampulsive things i regret in the months since that, ive been making mistakes left and right, hurting people, and doing risky things for no reason the last couple of months. i got a divorce, i fight with my loved ones every ti ame we talk now. i joined college but i have no motivation and i am failing classes. i have a new boyfriend and the relationship makes me really happy but other than that i am really struggling in all areas and i do not want to be someone who only finds her happiness from a relationship. i had a really bad day and a fight with my sister and i am considering checking myself into the hospital for help. but i am terrified. i do not want them to treat me badly, i do not want to end up stuck in there against my wi will, i do not want to go and not get help and it all be pointless. i finally got health insurance recently after not being to the doctor in more than years. but it was over a month wait for my pri amary care. its sti will two weeks before i can see her plus however long it takes to get bloodwork and referrals and shit afterwards. i feel overwhelmed and like i can not wait that long for help. can anyone tell me what would happen if i checked in to a hospital? or what i should do? i feel like i need i ammediate help but i do not want to get trapped in the hospital without being able to leave or something and it was always dri willed into my head that is what happens if you ever go to psych. someone help, please?	moderate
just tell me i do not deserve this i frequently and more or less randomly feel transported back to some undefined moment around or years old probably, just watching the sunset and wondering vaguely about what life wi will have in store for me and all of us, really . and the next moment it is like i am waking up from a nightmare, panicking and not even knowing why, and it turns out for almost years i was not in control of everything going on because i was asleep the whole ti ame, having the nightmare. and then i am scared and everyone is worried and taking on collateral damage and i hate myself for it and then i realize how awful that is and then i am angry at the unfairness of it all but it is too late the anger has spi willed over and i am ruining things for no good reason and beyond exhausted. i do not know if i can ever get any comfort from deciding if what happened when i was years old was the start of the nightmare, or if i was doomed before it even started. i guess if i decide that i was doomed anyway then it is a little easier to be a little less angry, but then there is nowhere no one to focus the anger on to, except life itself, and then feeling like an idiot because i can not deal with life but then right back to being angry at any one who would dare suggest that when they have not had to live my life. it comes and goes, i have not yet found a medication that can stave it off, at least not enough for any actually comfort just a little less panicky reaction and always with the trade off of being sleepy as fuck all god damn day long.	moderate
how do i help others if i can not help myself i feel like i am constantly relied on to help others but struggle in doing so. i try my best but it never feels like enough. it feels pointless pretending i am okay with my life when i am not. i just can not escape the thoughts in my head and it feels like there is never anyone actually there for me and i know it may sound selfish in saying that but i am just tired.	moderate
how do you build a support network when depressed? my circumstances are unhealthy in that i only have close friends in my area who i feel too dependent on. i want to expand socially but the only way for me to do that is continual ti ame and effort and then maybe a friendship wi will form. it is so exhausting and i usually feel like shit about myself after social events, but i am tired of being so god damn lame. i am embarrassed at my friends possibly noticing how lame i am as well and am afraid they wi will push me away because of it. i just do not know what to do.	moderate

this is weird so i came to the realization that i am an active suicidal thinker, i always say i am not going to go through with it. i have my plan, have for about years now i am almost . after reading an article about being passive vs. active i do not know what happened but i just started balling when i found out as i was reading, and i always knew of the thoughts and never pondered at them but something just clicked this ti ame i guess.. everywhere i look says its serious that i should get professional help or consult a friend or something i just do not find it serious tbh. so after a minute of crying, i just stopped i am guessing its the shut down coping mechanism i have i assume . after some minutes went by i looked at myself in the mirror, at first i was not even sure if i was looking at myself... is that me i thought, but it is like i did not recognize myself, for some reason i looked taller and that when i moved it seemed like the mirror was not completely in sync like the mirror was slower than me, i never felt that before i do not know what is wrong with me	moderate

i do not think of my depression as an i willness as much as i think of it as a parasite. does anyone else feel this way? it is difficult to explain but i feel like it is a thing that has gotten inside me rather than something that originated within. whenever i think or talk about my depression i always speak as though it is a separate entity and not just an aspect of my brain. i find it kind of helpful because if i am acting up or feeling bad i can think it is not you, it is only the depression which calms me to a degree, but lately this has me a bit worried because i do not want this practice to develop into some kind of split. it is just something that has been eating at me and i wanted to see if anyone has experienced the same thing.	moderate

i have not felt the same since weeks into college i woke up my heart racing and head spinning. i felt fatigued and gross , naturally i developed healthy anxiety which was crippling. i started to isolate, convincing myself i would feel better soon. i never did, doctors told me i was fine and healthy. i sti will was convinced something was wrong. my health anxiety persisted and developed into general anxiety. i began to isolate more and became very depressed. i was crying every night and begging god for help. i finally went and got counseling and anxiety depression meds. i am less anxious and do not cry every night. however it is been months and i sti will do not feel myself. i have a hard ti ame exercising and feel gross when i move around. i have low energy and hardly laugh as much. i get irritable and feel little emotion. talking to people is so much harder than it used to be. all i want to do is isolate myself cause i do not feel as if i am the same. i feel stupid and can not seem to focus which in turn effects my grades, i am late all the ti ame as well, and have a harder ti ame with memory. someti ames i get suicidal but i wi will not give up that easy. i know there is a bigger plan for me than that. however this is really hard, i would do anything to get the old me back.	moderate
my intrusive thoughts are back i had been doing so well for the past few years, i started going to therapy, made friends that i actually felt close to, and even started to feel like i could live normally. but now, the constant stream of suicidal thoughts are back. i know i can live with them because i have for as long as i can remember. what i can not handle is the taste of a normal life. my future seems so bleak in the face of this, i wi will never leave this part of me behind and no one deserves to get dragged down with me. i just want it all to end, i do not want any of this anymore.	moderate
what a life. i remember when i was younger learning about what cutting was and thinking damn how could anyone do that? that ll never be me . but now the thought of hurting myself is the absolutely only thing that gives me any type of relief throughout the day. i am fucking pathetic	moderate
not even sad anymore, just feel nothing always i have m come to an odd place in my depression that kinda has made it worse for me. throughout my life i have aways been somewhat hyper aware of my own emotional state, as my emotions have always been something which i have felt incredibly intensely. when i was younger i was very lonely and had a hard ti ame connecting with others, this grew into something i came to recognized as situation depression. i had always believed i would feel truly better if i made those i amportant social connections in my life. eventually i did, i found myself in a strong circle of friends, working towards my life goals, and in love for the first ti ame in my life with an amazing girl. this truly made me content, my depression went away and for the first ti ame in my adult life i knew what it was like to be happy and proud of myself. this lasted about years and made me believe that it was possible to live a happy life. slowly and one by one i began to lose the things that were i amportant to me. my family moved across the country while i was in school and our relationships soured, my girlfriend moved away, we tried long thistance but it was not what she wanted, she ghosting me and started a new life, my best friends slowly started to move away, change for the worse lots of drugs and alcohol involved or leave, one of my best friends passed away, and i started to fail out of school. all of this put me into the darkest hole ive ever been in and to be honest i am not sure if i have ever fully recovered. i can remember the most intense and excruciating sadness of my life, physically it felt like this vast aching hollowness inside of my chest and stomach that would never ever go away. like the deepest blackest pit i could i amagine had replaced the spot where my heart used to be ... over the next two years things began to turn around and my life i amproved. i turned my grades around after about horrible wasted semesters, i started a new relationship, met some new people who became my friends, and i started working again after a long break. but truthfully i never felt content the way i used to and i am sti will not the same. i dont truly connect with friends anymore and feel thistant to everyone around me. i have now graduated from school finally with my ba after years and moved back to my hometown, i dont keep in touch with my newer friends and only really talk to my girlfriend who ive been with for years now we re doing long thistance now and its hard . someti ames i honestly dont feel the capacity to love someone anymore and it puts an incredibly heavy strain on my relationship with her, i feel she deserves better than that and she always have. but the truth is i dont feel anything anymore, its just blank numbness every single day and night of my life. i am trying to get past it, i am trying to better and love what i sti will have and what ive made for myself but i sti will feel so utterly empty and void of emotion, its almost like that is the best emotionally i can do for myself and ive just come to except it. i am about to turn now, i am looking for full ti ame jobs, staying active with exercise, i am sober since the new year and trying my best in my relationship but sti will feel profoundly empty. i dont know what the point of this post really is but i needed to share my story. i really appreciate it if you read this far and would be happy to read any response or advice anyone in this community has. thank you.	moderate
i am a failure. i am. there is no denying it anymore. i work harder and harder and finally have found some type of acceptance. i just wish assisted suicide was more readily available and not expensive. my family would be in shambles. i could not. but fuck do i want to. there is no more hope. i have no more friends. i can not get laid without paying for it. i live at home like a fucking child. i have a degree from a community college. i am so short that most people hold zero respect towards me or would not even look at me. i am very, very tired. i just want to die.	moderate

i do not even have enough energy to lie anymore someone asked me how likely i would be to freeze my body to be brought back to life later and my i ammediate thought was, no, i do not even want to be alive right now. what i said was no, i do not... want to... do that... as i realized i am really fucked in the head but i had already started to answer the question. i just needed to put it out there somewhere, that i am really depressed and i feel hopeless and just tired of being alive. i dread being asked how i am because i hate lying and i do not want to tell people about how constantly i think about ki willing myself. i want to go home no matter where i am and it makes me feel so lost, like i do not even know myself or how to be happy. i do not think i am ever going to just be happy again.	moderate

i am depressed and have no motives. i am currently and i dread every day of my life. i do not remember how long this has been going on, maybe around years. i do not remember the last ti ame i had fun or have been happy. no, i do not ever feel like ki willing myself and wi will never do it. i just feel out of place in this world. i have thistanced myself from my so called friends because i have come to realize that they do not give a fuck about me and they are just fake. i do not care about my grades at all but i am sti will passing my classes somehow. all i do is sleep in class because i am not motivated to learn any of the useless shit that they are supposed to teach you. i do not plan on going to college because i wi will be getting kicked out of the house as soon as i turn so i wi will have to work a full ti ame job just to survive. i also struggle with girls. all of my fake friends talk to all these girls and i just sit behind and watch. i do not really understand how they work. i have had a few girls come up and tell me that they thought i was cute or something but i did not know how to handle the situation so i just say thanks and just walk away like a loser. just thinking about girls makes me feel depressed because i have never had a girlfriend. shit, i have not even kissed or held a girl is hand. i do not even know if i had held a conversation with a girl for a minute. it feels like people are always faking their feeling towards me so i just push them away, i just can not seem to trust anybody. whenever i get home from school aka prison i just eat, watch movies, and sleep. just to wake up and do it all over again. i do not really see the point in trying in life because i do not see myself having a good future. i know i am probably sounding selfish and lazy but i just do not know what to do anymore. there is a lot wrong with me and i thought reddit might be able to help. who knows.	moderate
what is it like to feel? life is boring. i have not felt emotion in a very long ti ame. the only ti ames where i actually feel something is when i know it is fucking i ampossible to be happy. i would be alright with being sad. it might be a fucking change in my life. i do not even try to get close to anyone but my sole friend because i know nobody would give shits about me. it feels like i have a stuffy nose but it is emotion i am not smelling . it feels like i have a dry mouth and i have not actually blinked in a very long ti ame. i just want this to fucking end. i only feel when i know there is something i want but i wi will never fucking get.	moderate
why do i have nothing to say when someone asks me if i am okay? i am quiet and i have a mi willion thoughts of whats wrong with my life and everything that goes on. i get suicidal thoughts running through my head almost daily but whenever someone asks me if i am okay i i ammediately get defensive and forget everything that is wrong and feel like if i say what is wrong i wi will sound fake or that it is not true. but once they leave me alone i go back into the same depressing state of mind. i feel like outcast in my own family and they think i am fine but i constantly fantasize of telling them everything but i am afraid that they would not believe me because i have always told them that nothings wrong. also i feel like if i did tell them it wouldn t be enough to convince them i am depressed, like they wouldn t believe me or just say i am making it up because i have brought up some si amilar stuff before and they completely ignored it. how can i get over this? i am sorry if this seems like a jumble of words idk how to get this out coherently.	moderate
i just realized something, not exactly for the first ti ame, but i never really thought about it like this. i have been laying in bed watching netflix for like, idk, hours? i have not showered in like, days. not bad really. but i do need to. i have school tomorrow. i was thinking about that. and my cat walked into the room. for some reason, i thought it was almost scolding me xd. stupid, i know, but whatever. so, out loud, i just said, i can not. before, i always just thought i can not...but no, i am probably just saying that because i do not want to. but, i realized that i really can not. i can not get out of bed and open my door, walk to the bathroom, and shower. i can not. i can not make myself do it. it is things like this that my family wi will never understand. i move out in two years, two months, and ten days. yah, i have a countdown. they just think i am lazy. that i am just trying to inconvenience them. but i am really not. if i could do the things they want me to do, i would. it is not like i enjoy being yelled at. i just. i can not someti ames. i know that i am too young and have had such a good life and have no reason at all to feel like this...well, someti ames i thisagree with that, but...hey nothing i can do about all that. i thought i was doing better. but today i could not even get out of bed and shower. god, i hate this.	moderate

so done never had what you would call even a close acquaintance for about years now no one to call or talk to about literally anything . i go to school, but for a useless two year degree only to appease my parents which i struggle to maintain a decent grade and sanity despite it being not a hard degree . they say get a hobby, but i have barely done anything, just stuck as a beginner. music and games i find it hard to feel any emotion from anymore. i even used to at some ti ames kind of look forward to meeting people with si amilar interests, but lately i just feel inadequate too far behind ski willwise and socially to interact well with anyone. meanwhile, everyone around me at least seems to have at least some sort of health socially. i really do not feel like meeting new people, even though i know i probably really should. i guess i have become more used to being not just an introvert but an isolated person. and my home is not even comfortable anymore, when my parents took out my bedroom doorknob out of thiscipline and the man up get out of your shell especially b c you re the oldest brother attitude and the fact that i never really got along with them anyways. but i guess this is where i stay since it is what i deserve, nothing but toxicity, along with the depression and anxiety. seriously, there is nothing interesting about me. i am literally just a depressed anxious loser. i do not think you could say that i am hanging on. i am just an empty shell going through the motions. i know i should be doing more, but i am so tired.... so tired. it is been a tough road just dragging this heavy body of mine around, and i know it is supposed to be entirely worth it in the end.. but i guess what i have been feeling more of is that i si amply can not do it. sorry for this chunk of negativity of a post, i hope everyone else out there is getting by fairly well at least.	moderate

an escape i honestly dont care anymore, i have no genuine wi will to survive and live in this world anymore. it is all the same blinded happiness that everyone shares. that fake positivity that is only there to give us some kind of meaning and some kind of comfort in our pointless existence. and as people say it gets better, life is never a constant low point, that phrase is so tired out and overused, along with the fact that a guarantee for happiness is never guarenteed, it is just padding to say you may get better. an the taboo thought of finding an escape through suicide doesnt seem that bad to me. i see it as a way to get all this pain off of me, and a way to thisappear completely, able to get rid of this body and not exist anymore. its neither bliss nor agony, its nothingness. that idea currently gives me what people call hope, a hope that this kind of pain wi will cease to bother me, and i wi will cease to exist. the uselessness of my current life and the doomed future that i have wouldnt be a problem to myself and others around me. as they could just move on with their lives, and i would achieve what i currently want, to not exist. it is a win win for both parties. people just dont understand how pointless their existences truly are, and the weight of that realization probably steers people away from accepting it. and that just harms everyone. blindly thinking that you have meaning in a world void of exactly what you preach to be real. it just gives me all the more reason to believe that me not existing wouldnt change that many things, excluding a small bit sadness and that is it. just as pointless as my current existence.	moderate
so, what now? i was a happy child. everything was interesting. i talked so much, shared so much. i had hope. i was a dreamer. i felt like i could achieve so much in this world. years went by. school and everything... acnes appeared. they covered all of my face and body. years later i learned that my black liver was the problem. so i sti will have it. but i learned to live with it. then i graduated. i was to become a teacher. but i did not because exams after exams and interviews on and on.. i stayed years at my parents. no job.. because i was terrified to go out there. i played video games at nights. slept through the days. i was hospitilized thinking i was having an heart attack. transferred to psychiatry. never went. i refused. i thought that if i had a job, a girlfriend, money, the things i want, then i would be happy as fuck. well, i got a job. first months felt great. i could get anything i wanted. i did. i love photography and movies. so i got myself a dslr. i went to work. my co workers liked me because i was joyful not because i had a brand new job, but because i was always like that to other people. i like smiling, socializing, making them laugh. then years after, i loved someone. she did not want me but kept seeing each other because we are in a tiny county and we do not have an oppurtinity to meet new people. we always have to see each other. i decided i did not want to talk to her. because we spent a lot of ti ame together at work and outside of work. like we were lovers. so it was ki willing me. she is maybe the reason but i got my life in order. i exercise, started reading books again, i got myself a midi keyboard and making music, playing video games for fun, writing, socializing... but the fact that she does not love me back, i sti will do these things. i sti will look after myself. want to i amprove myself. for what? i do not know. but i feel like if i do not do this, i wi will break down. because i have to hold on to something. this is not a love pain. this is not about love. but loneliness. i was rejected many ti ames. holy fuck they rejected me almost everyti ame. i do not think i am ugly or a jerk or a monster. they hurt, yes, but they did not hurt me like this ti ame. i feel useless. i feel tired. whatever i do is just a rememberence that i can be a normal person. if i am not busy with something, then i start thinking. suicidal thoughts are coming to say hi. i am not going to suicide that i know. because jesus man, what the fuck? who wants to do that if they are given a chance to live a good life. i said i was a dreamer. sti will i am. because i have hope. but it is fading day after day. people say what a good guy i am. but if i want to get closer to someone for a relationship, i might be the unluckiest, thisgusting, inadequate fucker. i feel like i am cursed. because i want to share everything about my life, even a tiny fragment of my mind. i would love to share them. but those people do not want to. i love smiling. i love making jokes. i love living. but i do not want to do this way. i am missing. i miss something.	moderate

confused of my fear of going out alone so, depression has run my life for someti ame, alongside anxiety out the butt. it has been even worse with the added stresses of school. the one thing that truly baffles me is the fact that i absolutely hate the way i look and think i am too attractive to have anyone want me. however, i am to scared to do anything alone outside because i am in an area with human trafficking relatively prevalent. so, i think i am horribly unattractive, but worried that it is all in my head and i wi will get abducted anyway to be sold into sex slavery, all because i want to go to the grocery store alone or start running outside. i feel like i waste so much energy on this worry alone 	moderate
please help i do not know how to help myself, i do not know what to do anymore. years, it is been two years and nothing has gotten better. i need help, i know i do. however i am and my family is not wi willing to help me. my fun loving personality has smeared away into this loud extra person, i need constant attention or else i start thinking, and when i start thinking there is no saving me. i just want help, i can not keep going anymore. i am not myself anymore, i am gone i am losing control of my emotions. i feel so crazy and no amount of love or support is able to fix this. he hurt me the trauma would not fade away, but they do not care. they kept hi am under the same roof as me and they told me to stop being selfish. why am i like this? why am i such a shitty person? why have not i gotten better? help me. please. i just want to be alright. i just want to stay in peace. i just need someone to care, not because they feel the need to, but because they care. i need someone who is pure intention is to help and support me. but people like that are gone. they do not exist. so until i find a way to piece back the few fragments i have left of myself, endlessly sleeping wi will have to be my sanctuary and i wi will be praying to find peace within myself.	moderate
questioning my sanity i have fallen into the usual slump during the colder seasons. i feel heavily demotivated and as a result i have stopped attending lectures. my self care decreases during this ti ame, as well. i also depersonalize much more than usual, often blanking out in the middle of doing an activity and being less engaged during any social interactions. usually this is all tolerable and i can pick myself back up quickly, but it has been increasingly difficult to bounce back because of what i have learned about my friends that i live with. first off, i just want to say that my friends have introduced me to a lot of new things about fashion, video games, etc. and are pretty cool and funny people. i know i am not extensively close with them, but they are enjoyable to be around and i thought pretty well of them. anyways, because the walls are so thin in my apartment, i can hear every conversation that occurs in the next door rooms, as well as in the living room and kitchen. usually this is not a problem because i just put on some headphones and drown out the noise while i am in my single room. but, unfortunately, when my roommates assumed that i was not able to listen in on their conversation in the living room, i overheard them making fun of me. the first ti ame i thought it was just a joke and did not make a big deal out of it. over ti ame, though, i noticed that they constantly talked behind my back and always made fun of me and talked shit about me. i also realize that they do the same about other people. they have started to make fun of me about how i do not talk to them and that i only laugh every now and then and call me a talk show host to my face. i have never once responded to any of their snide remarks, but it has become increasingly overbearing for me to handle. some days i wake up to them talking shit about me and some nights i sleep to the same thing. my anxiety has substantially increased, i have mini amized my social interactions with them and, as a byproduct, with many other friends , and my self care has been fucked as of late sleeping schedule ruined, diet not as healthy, hygiene is poor . it took me a while to realize my so called friends that i am living with are kind of assholes. and i am potentially living with them next year. anyways, i feel way more depressed and way more anxious in social situations nowadays and i do not know what to do. negative thoughts keep clouding my head and the passive thoughts of suicide have started to increase. i do not know who to call my friends anymore and i have been questioning almost every little thing as of late. what should i do?	moderate
this world just does not appeal to me... at all it is like i literally do not belong in this world. i do not want money. i do not want a fast car or a big house. i am sick of working hours a week for a life that has no appeal to me. literally the only reason i have not ki willed myself is to not upset my family. i just do not want to be in this world. life is like a bad movie that i just want to be over already. the parts that are not bad are sti will sooo boring!	moderate

it never fucking goes away i hate myself and my life. the only enjoyment i ever get is learning new things but i feel so clouded and stupid it is i ampossible to do. there is hours in a day but i feel like i only remember . i have lost all my old interests, clinging to new ones in desperation. i can only cope with weed, which leaves me broke, i go without it and mostly can not sleep or relax but my wallet likes it. i got hit by someone else on the road not my fault and they destroyed my car now i have to deal with that too. i promise i would be better off if they just destroyed me with it, because the insurance i pay for every month is not compensating me a penny so far. i go to college and work but realize more and more i am doing what society says and going into debt because of it. i swear i would be fine si amply living day to day if i could just have a roof over my head and an apple a day. everything is exhausting. i push people away then get upset when they do not give me attention. always defensive and irritable. i have nobody to talk to. and if i did i wouldn t value them. i want to run off into the woods away from everything and if it ki wills me so be it. incoherent mess but it wi will get it off my chest. post.	moderate

it never gets better, my depression is inescapable. as much as i want to have a good life, i do not think i can take having another breakdown. i wi will be old and sti will have depression. at one point i met be content with life, but depression wi will always be in the back of my mind. that is how it is always been. maybe my genetics are to blame. i am just too sensitive. people hurt me so easily. i wish it was not that way. i wonder if it really wi will get better. is it ti ame to try medication? i have done it before, someone told me they did not like me on them tho...	moderate
nobody actually fucking cares lmao it s all posturing bullshit. i am going to die alone and i deserve it. none of you strangers give a fuck and no one in my life does either. it is all pointless anyway, maybe tommorow wi will be the day that i work up enough courage to end this bullshit. i am tired of the games, i am tired of the expectations. i wi will never be functional and no one fucking cares, if i had a gun i would have ended it already. maybe i wi will finally work up the courage to stand in front of a train. fuck i hate this life and i hate being alive, what the fuck is the point. i just want a sign. a reason to actually care. but i am too much of a piece of shit too see it. i am too much of a piece of shit to ki will myself like i deserve. but i hope i do soon.	moderate
i feel bad and i have no one to talk to. i have no friends anymore. i had great friends, but for the past year they have been treating me terribly, making me cry myself to sleep at night, making me very stressed. i finally decided to cut them out. it is been one of the hardest things i have had to do, they have prevented me from ki willing myself many ti ames because i loved them. now i have no one. i had no choice but to leave them. some of the ti ame it is ok, but on lonely and sad nights like these i wish i could pick up my phone and text a friend like i used to be able to. these were my childhood friends, my family. honestly my mind has been much clearer without them tormenting me, but i can only think of the good ti ames now. i wish i had someone to talk to again. i miss the people they used to be. i wish i had friends.	moderate
a state of aloneness, comfortable and all encompassing o god! a sensation of closeness, albeit one havest i known only in dream, this, fair one, i crave but, in this, a paradox lies, for i value my independence, an aloneness of the highest degree, more greatly canst words express. love, a fleeting, fickle thing, havest i known it, i remember not. and sti will, i seek it, gazing behind every tree, every rock. it is the agent of my own demise, this i can see with clarity, and sti will, i search for it eagerly. masochism perhaps ingrained within my very being, i crave this pain. what false connections i hold now, fleeting as sky a second before the sun is to dip below the horizon, staining what was blue warm hues numbering thousands these i cherish and what is precious, i am all but wi willing to burn. to be the ulti amate, to be known, i crave this, but it is as far off a dream as it is the average man to walk amongst the stars. god, o god! and dost not this feel just as remote?	moderate
my friend i do not know what to do. i feel so lost right now like i am losing my friend to depression. life has been very hard for them lately. they are shutting me out and in turn my mental health is worsening, but i do not want to put that burden on them. i think they know i am not entirely alright and in turn that is making it even worse. i try my best to be strong and i really want to help, i just do not know how. we used to play games and hang out every day online, but now it is like i am not wanted anymore. they leave without saying a word, ignores messages, and then i go to sleep. i can barely eat, i wake up several ti ames in the night, i cry at work, just writing this is difficult. i do not know what to do. i am kinda panicking. this is the closest friend i have. i just want this to be over, i want to be happy with my friend again.	moderate
tw self harm. being alone sucks i am fine when around people because i can put a mask on and pretend everything is ok. i do not really want to be around them at all, but i have to work to pay bi wills. however when alone i can just let go. it is at that ti ame when everything crashes upon me all at once. i feel worthless, burdensome, and have a deep sadness clawing to come out along with thoughts of death, but not suicide. i long just to give in and cut, but that would make everything worse. i wi will feel like a failure if i do as i have not done it in just over a year. it is just a matter of ti ame before i do as it is just getting harder to not give in.	moderate
already depressed, breakup piled on it may not have been the best idea to get in a relationship in the state i was in initially. but, i guess after insistence from my now ex at the ti ame about how they could handle my problems, i caved. to make a long story short, they could not handle my problems. they fell in love with someone else and moved on in what seemed like a single weekend, and they had no qualms telling me any of that either. though i can not say i am surprised by that decision, it sti will hurts like a bitch. i feel helpless, used up, and denied vindication i like to think i deserve, but know i do not have a right to. i felt an i ammense amount of love for the person in question, but now that they are gone, i can not help but intersperse those feelings with profound hatred. sorry if this is scatterbrained. it is just that i have had negative thoughts before, but none quite as vitriolic and violent as these. i am already seeking help to make sure i do not really go off the deep end, but i sti will feel the need to try and reach out to people who have been in it, as opposed to just a mental health professional.	moderate

i have been reading the posts that i made in the past, and it is all starting to click. everything. i just was not cut out to live. all i can see when i look back is contempt at my thoughts and actions. sure, it was partially because of my worldview, but, yeah, i was not cut out. as i sit here, i feel the dull echoes of pain as memories cause mental scars to resonate. i think i always knew, and the thing that always kept me going... was that things would eventually get better. not that i would get better, but that things would. i never had a solid father figure to look up to, and for the longest ti ame, i felt lost, like i was fighting against hi am. now i look at hi am as a champion, one who went through everything that life gave hi am and won in the end, and i mean, won. he is happy, unaffected by the ratrace, and content with his life, or at least it seems like it. i want to give hi am access to my private reddit account on the day that i do inevitably blow my brains out so that he can look back and reflect on my anguish, and how much i have grown as a person, to show hi am the full reason why i ended up pulling the trigger, because when i do pull it, it wi will be spontaneous. my life is not about to be wrecked, but if i do not do anything, it definitely has the highest probability to be. i can not face myself the way i was, and i can not see how things could have been any better even if i did have a more solid worldview, because no matter how much i feel like i have control, it always feels like things are beyond me. i am at a point in life where i feel content with just flat out ending it. it wi will be ok, because i can finally forget everything that i have done, and i would not have to worry anymore. i wi will be free. free from possibly getting to the point where i am blindly believing in superstition. free from my physical li amitations. free from all of this. i doubt it wi will get better, because i wi will never feel good enough.	moderate
why is wanting to die a bad thing i feel like i have no more hope for life anymore. bad things continuously happen to me and at this point i want to give everything up. i dont want to try anymore because i know that nothing good wi will ever happen. i have hated my life all throughout high school. i used to have hope that my life wi will i amprove, but now i dont and the thought of dying is more exciting than anything that might happen in life. i am planning the last few days before my death and i feel excited from it. i am thinking about the movies i wi will watch, the food i wi will eat, and the people i wi will sti will talk to before i finally die happily. why is wanting to die a bad thing? why is life considered precious when all i feel is isolation, loneliness, judgement and labelling from my teachers and peers, and overall a lack of hope for my situation to change? why can not assisted suicide exist, why must we be continuously forced to live on earth because suicide is so so scary? i can not even sit through si ample tasks. sitting in class and feeling the alienation from my teachers and getting isolated from my peers is unbearable. constantly feeling inadequate and having people leave me from my non profit organization is unbearable. going home and having my parents use all my insecurities against me is unbearable. not being able to leave my province for university and start a new life is unbearable. being ugly and not being able to have anyone love me is unbearable. i have finally decided that life is worthy of living. my closest friends during the summer were all from twitter, but slowly our communication has been dying down because we all live in different parts of the world and we are all busy. before, i only lived because i thought my life wi will surely get better. i work so hard and i am good to people, but only bad things ever happen to me. no, i am not homeless, in a bad economic situation, or experiencing worse things than a lot of others, but i si amply have decided that i am done with life. i am tired from living and doing the same things everyday. i am watching my hope fade away right before my eyes. i used to daydream about having a life where i am happy with myself, in an environment where i dont feel judged and isolated. but now even that hope is going away and instead i daydream about dying. i just wanted to let this out. that is the first step before i go seek other help. i guess i want to find someone who understands me.	moderate

are you ever envious of openly depressed people? this is definitely a weird subject to talk about for obvious reasons, but i feel like i should sti will post this anyway. someti ames i get jealous of people who are openly depressed or do not hide that they are depressed. i do not mean people who do not bother putting on a smile for the day, i mean people who wi will thiscuss their mental i willness or make jokes about it. it is probably a pretty asshole way for me to think but i do not always think that way, just someti ames. one of the biggest reasons i feel this way is because people i know who do not hide their depression joke about it constantly and are really uneducated on the i willness. someti ames that leads to me feeling like they are not actually depressed but that is not in any way my place to talk because i do not know what goes on in their heads. but it definitely does annoy me as they just make the i willness a quirk or a personality trait instead of something that ruins lives. i get jealous because these people are offered support instead of me. which is thisgusting of me and i realise that. i am super happy for these people and glad they get help. just someti ames i wish i had people worrying about me too. i am jealous because they are the first to come out about the i willness or feeling and if i chose to then i am just jumping onto the trend. not that it is a trend but i do not want to be looked at that way. more of a personal example happened a few weeks ago. i was in class and my thoughts were swirly, i wanted to ki will myself then and there. adding to that i could not handle everyone is noise so i ran out of the room and spent the rest of the period hiding in the toilet. i then received a good old lecture about how my problems are insignifican not and that i was being i ammature. now there is a girl who goes to my school and can leave whenever she wants because she has told the school she has problems with depression and anxiety. please do not think i am. hating on her, i am not. i am so glad she is able to have things set in place to help her. just someti ames that makes me jealous. i have a mi willion more reasons but i do not think anyone cares and this is probably just me being i ammature anyway lol. i appreciate it if you too the ti ame to read this and i would love to know how you feel.	moderate
i think i want to end it why do not i just end it all now? i am years old. i live in a bedroom house which i share a bedroom w my mom and step dad. i have multiple health problems and years of childhood trauma not even dr phi will could fix. i am k in debt and need dental work, surgery and i am trying to get out of a toxic horrible living environment all w almost no money in my bank acc. i can not go anywhere, i am not allowed to drive, not allowed to have a license. not allowed to leave w out supervision. very toxic environment and so on. my day is wake up, change my grandmothers diaper do chores, things to pass ti ame. feed my grandma, take care of her. pass ti ame again. night falls, change her diaper place her in bed. i thought about applying to college which of course i have to do in secret because i am not smart enough to be anything according to my family. i sit in an invisible prison cell no one but me sees and i can not be heard or seen crying for help inside. everyday i think about life on the other side. how easy things are to end if i just do it. but i think about the very small list of people i care about. just . people who i know would be hurt and that gives me much drive not to. but everyday i hear in my head they wi will move on. they wi will be ok. i used to self harm constantly for hours at a ti ame. that was my way of coping for any pain i felt inside but i promised myself i would stay clean and i have done so since june th . it is been a long ti ame and at first i thought i really quit this ti ame. i would not do it again but lately i catch myself browsing blades on amazon, wanting the high. the escape all over again. i joined subreddits, thiscord servers, virtual support groups but overall nothing really helps. yeah i can sit and listen to people say it gets better all day. they can tell me ways to be happy my head is above water that day and this day but at the end of it all. i am sti will here. i am sti will going to wake up and go to sleep living the cycle i am trapped in. i am sti will going to suffer. not really sure what else i can add here, i guess maybe i just wanted to be heard in a crowd full of strangers.	moderate
something is wrong and i am falling behind in life. this is a message i am submitting to my university counselling service. i have never done any kind of counselling before and for some reason i feel better about also posting it here from a throwaway account. i do not know what to expect, but if anyone has any thoughts i would love to hear them hello, i am finding it very hard to talk about this but i think i need help and i see there are not any counselling appointments free for a couple weeks so i do not know what else to do. i am not sure exactly how this is supposed to work so i apologies if this is a long message, but it might be easier to get it out this way first rather than face to face. to be honest i think i have been struggling for a while but never tried counselling before as i have been able to either power through or scrape by just well enough to convince myself that there was not a problem or that i was in control of it. but i have been finding it increasingly harder to cope recently and i do not think i can do this on my own anymore. i have always had issues with procrastination, putting off i amportant work and then rushing to get it done last minute, but for the most part, as bad as it sounds, this used to work for me and i would get my work done on ti ame and to a reasonable standard without feeling excessively stressed or anxious. however, lately it feels like my life has been falling apart around me piece by piece and i can not find the wi will or energy to do anything other than stress out about it. this extends beyond my university life and has also affected my freelance work, which is my main source of income and something i am normally very passionate about. i have not even played video games in the past year or so, which used to be one of my main hobbies. at this stage, i find it extremely hard to even get out of bed on most days, and usually have to scream and swear at myself, someti ames literally, to do so. i now feel like i am genuinely just wasting my life away, often even avoiding my friends and loved ones because i have work to do only to end up idly watching the days go by and do nothing, which is all the more painful since i am fully aware of how li amited they are. this, together with my quickly deteriorating academic and financial situation have all been piling up to the point where i am constantly in a state of anxiety and despair and find it hard to think clearly or even sleep. apart from these problems, i know i have a pretty good life, i am honestly ashamed that i can not fix this on my own and believe i have no right to feel the way i do, but i am in my last year of university, with the end in sight, and i know that i can not afford to fail my courses, which is why i am reaching out for help. 	moderate

i want to get better but idk how. i can not even sleep, its kind of ridiculous how afraid i am of not even being able to watch an episode on netflix without browsing for a good hour. i go to sleep so late, at am because i can not sleep. i just lay in my bed and put on movies ive watched all so i can accomplish something. today i had a pb and j sandwhich and tuna. i eat when i wake up, a sandwhich if there is bread, then i wait for dinner to be made, my grandma or grandpa wi will make something but if they dont then i dont eat anything. its just so much effort to do anything and i dont understand why. i havent showered in so long, i have a feeling i smell but no one says anything but i know i do. i had a friend over and i washed the sheets the day before but i feel like my whole room smells because its the only room i am in everyday. i use to play video games but i just lost my interest in playing they are just too much effort so i just watch movies and shows now. but even then i find it hard to watch something i have to debate whether i should watch it or not. i do brush my teeth but i dont shower. i know i just typed it but i am really just typing to empty my thoughts its just constant. i was diagnosed with mdd and prescribed meds for it but i was picked up by my mother and taken to a different state and then i was never given anything. i had to go to a psych ward which was where i was diagnosed. why am i like this. i feel as though my mood got worse and the intensity snowballed throughout my days in school. i was a talkative person but as i got older i became quiet and then i just stopped talking altogether and it got worse and worse. i never saw it coming and now its like i get a day where i just sit on the floor and call anyone i know just to talk because i feel as though i should just ki will myself right then and there. but everyti ame i can not do it. i think the day someone doesnt answer is the day i might end up doing it. theres so much on my mind. and then on friday i am supposed to go to some funeral in california but i dont care for it i dont even know the person that is dead. my grandma said i was going i am so i could just stay and i think i should its a funeral and i feel itll just make things worse. does anyone know why i am this way? i feel terrible all the ti ame. sorry for the long post i meant for it to get straight to the point.	moderate
i have given up i do not know how people survive depression but i can not do it anymore i just want to give up. i know i made the wrong decision by telling my therapist that i want to stop my therapy sessions but the voices in my head told me to do it. i have tried to do everything to stop myself from committing self harm but so far nothing have worked. i want to ki will myself but my dog would not understand and i know my family wouldn t care because they were the ones that abused me. in a few days i am turning that is when i am planning to go to the bridge near my house and jump into the freeway so that way it wi will be quick and i would not be in pain anymore. i know my moms trying her best to make me feel better but it has not worked and i try to make myself feel better by doing my hobbies but my mom do not support them. so yeah i have made up my mind to ki will myself and after writing this i am going to start writing my suicide letter to my mom and telling her how much i love her and how much i love my dog and siblings. so yeah thank you reddit for all the stuff y all entertain me with and bye guys.	moderate
i am sabotaging myself sleeping does not help me, if i stay awake it is easier for me to handle everything because nothings expected of you at night, there is no you have to be doing something other than sleeping, but the night is where i feel most, whether it be good or bad, mostly bad i am just tired. physically and mentally, trying to say the same thing to people who do not listen, trying to explain something but not being able to properly articulate it without getting frustrated. i do not think i can do this anymore, i am hurting my family without getting help, but i can not get help if i do not want it and am not ready for it yet, what do i do i am really struggling, this is the worst its ever been before	moderate
is it today i am a little lost for words, but my soul is screaming for me to say something... anything. i love my aging and i will parents so much. i love them with all my heart and soul. i see their faces in my mind is eye and tears automatically fall, and i am fi willed with a sad but deep love that is too great for me to comprehend. i have not seen them for a long ti ame. i wi will not be able to handle their passing. i wi will go blind and mad and melt into the soil, and transform into a mist until all my constituent parts thisaparate completely as if it was never there in the first place, until i am just a vague and unknowable character from a thistant memory of some strangers dream that is already slipped through their fingers as they tried to recall it. do you know those ordinary people who were alive years ago? of course you do not. and nobody does. all their dreams, aspirations, passions, hopes and all their love is gone. well maybe some of it has passed on from generation to generation, but then whose do they belong to? i am sorry, this probably does not make sense. but what i am saying is... how i amportant is it really for us to do all these ridiculous things we re supposed to do in this insane world? i broke up with my gf a lifeti ame ago and i sti will can not get over her. my love was real babe. i miss you. i never lied, and i have not moved on. i si amply can not. nobody wi will replace you. my love meant something. my love means something. i messed up by neglecting you, but that is it for me. my love is real and i am not going to just let you go in my heart. i wi will never do that. love is painful beyond comprehension. why the hell would i want to do that again and also mini amise what i felt for you. never. i am so lucky to have a bro who gives me a roof over my head, and food to eat. he is so patient and understanding. but i do not know for how much longer i can take being dependent on others just to exist. i am burnt out and exhausted. getting through each day is a huge feat, and i do not even do much at all. i can not face this world. i want to die and wake up when this world system is completely changed. but that is a fat chance, so i guess i wi will just die and stay dead. i wish i had the energy to help change this world, even on the smallest scale, but my contribution feels futile and pointless because i can not even go to an interview for a job without thissociating and making an idiot of myself. i can not think straight now. my brain is all mush. all i can think about is what is happened in the past replaying itself over and over again. all i can think about is moving out my bros place and going to hang myself in some desolate and lonely place. it is all i think about every single day. i am thinking about doing it right now.	moderate
feeling much better, i actually have feelings again not just numbness so for a long ti ame i was in a deep dark depression, maybe a bit over two years. with regular bits of depression in my life before but not completely suicidal like i was in those two years. for a long ti ame i felt really numb emotionally, could not feel excitement or happiness. or ti ames i could feel them were very mini amal. i only really felt sadness and anger for many years even before my darkest ti ame. i really tried hard to find something that made me feel anything and found that i liked hiking and white water rafting although it just sparked the tiniest feelings in me then. over ti ame i could feel a bit more something that was less sadness. finding a passion got me to a point where i was functional, i had to do something every weekend for a long while. i went alone a lot too but luckily people went with me occasionally. i sti will was working a good amount which i always did but having something to look forward to helped a lot. i started seeing a therapist which did help actually even though i was functional at this point but sti will feeling pretty numb. talking about things with her helped me open up and i realized it was me who was numbing my emotions. trying to close myself off to sadness and anger also closed off joy and excitement too. so i am allowing myself to be more open and cry in front of people. learning about feelings and how to convey them which i was never taught before. i have gotten to the point where i can feel good feelings again and now more than i have ever been able to before. just from normal things like watching movies or seeing beautiful scenery on a hike. after this i ended up meeting a great guy too, we have a great relationship and great sex. of course i have dated a lot of crappy guys before hi am but it is sti will amazing to find someone you work so well with. i am really thankful that i kept trying. i just want to say that it is possible to get better and keep trying. you re all amazing for making it so far and keep on working to beat your depression. i wish you all the best and i am sorry things are so hard but it can get better.	moderate

i do not think i can manage all the information in this does not really have an order, i guess i am just typing what comes to mind. i am a sophomore in high school. i am just writing this here because i do not know where else to get my thoughts out, and i wi will probably just delete it later. i do not know if i have depression and if i am just feeling something other than depression then i am sorry, i did not mean to cheapen anyone else is struggle. i have a semesters worth of la and geometry online classes to do that are due tomorrow, and i do not have the ti ame or energy to get them done. there is a very good chance i am going to repeat my sophomore year. i do not have anyone to go to, if i try to express how i feel to my mother she somehow victi amized herself. i barely see my dad anymore because of the divorce, and my girlfriend is thousands of miles away. i do not have any friends that i can talk about stuff like this to. ever since the start of middle school i have always consistently gotten failing grades, mostly out of laziness and not caring. only this semester and last semester i have actually gotten any of my shit together. somehow i have li amped through my entire school career with all fs and never repeated a grade, and now i think i have destroyed my last chance. the one ti ame i have actually started wanting good things for myself i fuck it up worse than i ever have before, and now i can not handle the consequences. i have no one to blame but myself, i frequently make bad decisions, and i can not seem to make myself care enough to make good ones. i can not talk to my mother as i said before because she is really mentally fragile, and i can not have a serious thiscussion with her about things like this without her having a breakdown. i have been thinking about ki willing myself a lot but i just do not want to hurt my family and friends. even if you did not know the person hearing about a suicide is always really sad. i do not know how other people just have that drive to be functional, to try at life. i do not think i have that, and i do not know why. and i do not know how to fix it. i do not know what to do anymore	moderate
i feel like i am stuck in a hole again. i honestly do not know what triggered it. i have been working all night on some classes and then all of a sudden it hit me. i can not tell if it is my anxiety depression making me hate myself or if there is something wrong with me. i wish i had more people who understood me in life. i wish my family was more supportive and loving. i wish i was not such a burden to everyone i encounter. i just kinda wish i was not me anymore.	moderate
dark thoughts almost all the ti ame i do not interact with people that much, so i am at home most of the day, i keep having these visions of pulling out a pistol and shooting someone i do not really own any sort of gun , it keeps happening frequently, there was one ti ame at college, i was standing within a crowd of students and had this vision of carrying a rifle and shooting everyone, i do not feel like i have control over these thoughts, they just keep hitting me especially when my head is silent and clear, also they become very frequent when i try to sleep, i can not go to a therapist and do not actually have someone who d take this seriously	moderate
i fucking hate life i dont have a car, license, job or a meaning it seems. i am sti will living with my mom. all i do is sleep during the day like its nothing. i feel like i should give up nothing is out there for me. i have no friends. i can not open up to anyone ive tried my pi wills and nothing works i am sorry for wasting your ti ame.	moderate
can i just go? no goals. no aspiration. no needs beyond basic. dont want any of it. dont want any success. dont want anything i amportant up to and including continuing this living thing. dont want happiness. dont want self love. dont want any of the shit because i am just si amply tired of even thinking about it. so if i do not want anything, depression or not, why do i have to stay here?	moderate

school is making me so depressed and i am just ready to give up at this point. having to wake up at every day go to school, being expected to participate and engage on no sleep, coming home, my one safe place and being bombarded with homework... every day i have to choose. value my mental health, or value my school work. they can not coexist anymore. if i value my school work, i am up until in the morning trying to finish my school and homework with no down ti ame. if i value my mental health i start to fail my classes. it is all too much, and i do not know what to do anymore. the fact that i even show up to school anymore is a literal miracle. of course that is never good enough for anyone. neither is staying alive apparently. this august is my junior year of high school. apparently the hardest year for everyone. i could not even handle middle school... how the hell am i supposed to get through all of this? i am ready to drop everything and give up. i am so depressed i literally can not function anymore, and it affects my grades. and the bad grades make me more depressed. it is a vicious cycle, that nobody helps me through because nobody believes it is serious. they assume i am just the typical teenager who hates school. i am so sick and tired, and i am sick and tired of being sick and tired. god damnit i just want to sleep forever.	moderate
i hate my life. i guess no one wi will care about this post anyways, and even if someone wi will, they wi will cringe because of how emo it gets , but whatever i wi will act like this is a dairy. anyways, fuck my life. everyday i wake up, i can not feel nothing but how i look and feel like a pile of vomit, looking at my face, how much of an ugly faluire i am, getting ready to the hell again. i would go up to the board to answer a qustion in math, i can not feel anything except stress and anxity, my body starts shaking, and i am tearing in the eyes, and i hear the class laughing at me, laughing at an ugly, weird and pathetic moron. i am coming back to my home, sitting at my bed thinking about my shitty and pointless life, thinking about how an ugly ,weird ,lonely, sad, selfish, moron, pieice of shit teenager who brags about how shitty his life is. why no matter how hard i try i end up fuckign everything up, i dont really have any friends, i am an outcaust from my family, so i dont have anyone to share. i am alone, and i dont like being alone, and when i am near others i feel anxity. i can not do anything but envy others, happy people who get anything they need in their life, cakewalking everything, doing every action with ease, who arent even thankful for things people like me would ki will for, while every moment of my fucking existence is a oppertunity to shove a kitchen knife up my skull. i dont have a single positive aspect of me,i i have never been hugged,not even by my family members, i never had any girlfriend, or any female, or even a male that told me that i am at least slighty cute or something but no, the best i have ever been told is gross, and i guess that is exctly summs up what i am, gross, scary and thisgusting creature that no one needs. whatever, could be worse, i could have been burned alive or born as a mutant and get deleted from socity, i could have got cancer or any painful thisases, i could have been a tortured and raped, and from this view my life is pretty fucking awsome, but thinking about this awful dreadful shit doesnt help at all, and only makes me view the world as worse. i have three options, suck it up, live a life of sadness and hate, or die.	moderate

we can not do it long post, but this has been years in the making. my wife and i are a team, we love each other madly, and we are the parents to wonderful, smart, funny, and soul completing children. but neither of us can keep going. every day is just something to get through, because we know that our tanks are not only empty. we passed empty and have been running on fumes for nearly a year. we live in canada, and there are some that think canada is a place full of great social programs and there is no way that any family can fall through any cracks. but it is not, and we have. do not get me wrong, there is some funding we get. but due to my job, and our unique bear with me, i wi will explain circumstances, we re living from paycheck to paycheck, with no hope of getting out of our mental health, financial, and housing challenges. nor being able to afford helping our children have a bright future. this is not even considering fairly severe cli amate anxiety from my wife and i. my dear wife suffered much childhood trauma, so much so that she is been diagnosed with c ptsd. the diagnosing psychologist told us that because it is not in the latest dsm, it is not officially recognized, and thus we can not secure support for it. and just a few months ago she was diagnosed with fibroyalgia. just yesterday, her gynecologist told her there is a growth of tissue next to her c section scar. it is been causing her i ammense pain on top of the usual fibro pain. she is got some therapy, but her sleep and gastrointestinal system cause daily problems. she is strong, and she is organized, but the load for her is physically, mentally, administratively i ammense. our oldest child was diagnosed with a very rare brain thisorder at months that manifests as severe cognitive mental physical thisabilities. they are deaf, use a wheelchair for mobility, and use diapers. we re cognizant that children with severe special needs do not have typical life spans. as a result we re making plans for both their passing, and care for them should we pass, or are physically unable to give them care. they go to a decent school with excellent student teacher ratios, and their laugh is food for the soul. but diapers for a y.o., wheelchair van upkeep, leg braces, and medical cbd for their anxiety makes for a tight budget. they are on their second wheelchair, and we just finished paying off their first wheelchair last year. it was not covered by my job is health insurance, and we were left with over dollars k to pay out of pocket. if it was not for the portion covered by the province, we d sti will be paying it off. our middle child was diagnosed at with moderate to severe autism, and developmental delay. there is a decent chance they wi will also need our care for their entire life. like our oldest, we must plan for their care should we pass, or are unable to provide their care. their therapy that worked in the past is absolutely not in budget. there is no publicly available therapy for any children with autism in our province. school is not on the radar because there is not enough support. they were enrolled for their first year, but literally escaped the school too many ti ames. many meetings, letters and such were had but no i amprovements were on the menu. we homeschool when my wife is physically able. our youngest child had an accident when they were an infant that led to hospital visits of varying lengths, specialists, and the involvement of both police and children is aid. they were just recently diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety to the point where the paediatrician was ready to prescribe prozac i ammediately. we have decided to go the medical cbd route for their mental i willness as well as therapy offered free through my place of work. because of the anxiety is severity, we homeschool our youngest when my wife is physically able. my mother was diagnosed, treated, falsely cleared, re diagnosed, and re treated for non hodgkin is lymphoma. she is been in remission for a few months and her hair is growing back, but my parents live over km away and travel is not in the budget. after my mother was diagnosed, i cried every day. someti ames several ti ames a day. i felt like my entire life was i amploding and dreamt of just dying. i did not make any suicide plans, but it was on my mind very often. i knew deep down that it would only benefit me and no one else. i tried to stay exercising, but have not seen the gym in months now. my doc put me on a fairly heavy dose of effexor, and now my blood pressure is creeping up. i sti will feel like my life is i amploding, but at least i am not actively looking for ways to off myself. my wife and i kind of joke with each other about how we re lightning rods for the whole province. our home is not ideal, our oldest child is one floor below us, and we re in constant fear of not hearing them through the monitor we have if they need us in the night. the noise is incessant from many types of aircraft and traffic. the wind howls nearly every day because of our proxi amity to an airfield. our shed makes ramshackle look ritzy and we re literally waiting for it to fall down. my wife can not find a job because our province is school system is failing two of our children. as parents, we are on constant and never ending meltdown prevention for our children. we only kind of joke with each other about wondering what wi will happen next. we can not afford upkeep on our wheelchair van. we can not afford the therapies that would help our children the most. the money we re able to save is towards our children is rdsp is and resp s. there is also some money saved to buy an accessible home but we can not afford to find a home that is not next to an airport, let alone one that is accessible for my oldest child, or my wife is fibro. our mental health is in tatters, we do not have anyone who can provide respite overnight. i have resorted to googling if there is any wealthy people who can be a sponsor for our family that seems plagued by calamity and setback. beats committing suicide, i suppose. my wife and i are both sleeping terribly, we re both in need of peace and quiet for a few days. we re both trying desperately to have enough mental energy to ensure that our kids do not grow up neglected, or grow up with worse mental health than us. but we can not go on. we re just making it through each day because we can not just die.	moderate

i was told to have a great day today but i feel worse does anyone else suffer from this problem? feels like even if someone is being sincere that instead of the intended effect of making you good, for someone who has depression you just feel guilty bad. i wonder if it is either a trust issue, your brain not allowing you to feel good or just the result of emotional abuse as a child.	moderate

i posted a lot of info about my experience in r suicide watch and never got a reply to my post. just a a friendly person i replied to his own post. tomorrow or saturday i plan on ending my life. long post. but it wi will get buried like they always do. i have the plan, with multiple steps to make sure it works and i would not be a survivor with more scars. my friends do not understand, my ex shattered every ounce of my being, betrayed my trust, my love, my hopes, my dreams, our future. i am left with nothing starting from scratch. and i do not have the strength left. something had always held me back but i can not anymore. the problem is me. i can not even make friends who are normal. i am so fucked uo and i have lived through more shit that any almost year old should ever have to endure. i have virtual friends through phone. i am in a foreign country because of my ex who wants nothing to do with me. her family that is supposed to love me as they are own do not talk. i have no family my self and every keeps giving the same pep talk and i am tired of it. i am in total darkness. and it is all i see. is what this year should have been. i am tired of my life, i am tired of loss and pain. losing the ones i really let in. i am so damaged. and no one can handle it. i have been depressed for years. walking depression yet it creeps up and destroys all i hold close. ti ame after ti ame. i do not want to go back to the us. i left myself too many financial problems and my ex said it would be okay because i am here with her. she lied and betrayed. i tried taking my life the night we broke up. but with the look on her face and how she broke down i could not. i then in a fit of rage at myself did the unthinkable and caused the most damage. i stabbed myself deep in the leg. they sent me home. i have healed but i continue this circle. i am doped yo on enough meds that if i take them all along with a bottle of liquor and using the box cutter she never should have given me back. laying in a warm but and making the crucial cuts after taking the rest. there wi will be no making it through. i wi will fall asleep and drown in the tub. i have it planned to the point that of ways wi will take me out. all i have left is the letters to write. texts to send her and transferring her or her mother all my money i have. and leaving a list of last requests including my mother is ashes i have with me... i think this weekend wi will be the end of my life of pain and suffering.	moderate

i feel completely empty i am , starting my gcses in may, and i have been going through things that i have never really been able to explain for years until now. i have very frequent mood swings, and during them i mostly feel empty. like all of my emotions have been drained out of me, and that i have become just a walking husk of skin and bone. i feel as if i am always blunt with everyone and that the reason why i am so lonely is because all i do is push people away. and because i feel that i push people away i then feel even lonelier because i do not even feel sorry for myself. i then wonder if everything i am feeling is real or if i am just faking it for attention and then i feel even worse about myself because i feel like that is what i am doing so i push people away and the whole thing repeats until i just feel like i would be better off dead. like everyone else is lives would be so much better without the burden of my problems in them. like all i am doing is dragging everyone else down with me. i just want it to stop. is there anyone else out there that feels the same, or that can help me? because it is all just getting too much	moderate
end up in the psych unit for the second ti ame in a year my depression caused by the people that would not stop hurting me. my nps told the cops that i might an alcoholic. we had a fight started because he did not get what he wants it without telling me that need to be hug and given affection. it was am. he wants to talk about his feeling when before i asked hi am if there is something i can do for hi am while he is having panic attack. i was asking hi am couple ti ame if there is something i can do for hi am to make hi am feel better. he said no. so i left hi am be in the guest room while i takecare myself after long day from work. after i took care of myself, i asked hi am again if there is something i can do for hi am. he said no and just asked to snuggle. so did snuggle and as my usual night, i have couple drink just to wind down and enjoy my night at my house he is living in our house where he threw my stuff without telling me or saying anything i asked the cops and they said it is i willegal to do so, when they come to my house to pick me up to be taken to the hospital because of my suicidal attempt . we had an argument at am right when i said that i am tired and ready to go to bed. but as he wants to talk about his feeling at am, he got upset just because i was being more affectionate towards our dogs instead of hi am. and i said oh my god, he became so upset and said he wi will ki will hi amself, or going away with the dogs without me, or left everything behind just thisappeared . i got panic attack and told hi am, that if he died, i wi will be responsible for hi am trying to die. so i told hi am just to left my house and take the dogs with hi am because i know he wi will feel safe if the dogs with hi am. i was about to call my sister after he left, but he did not. we had an argument where he said that i am a narcissist, i am an alcoholic, i am an evil person period. i become more upset and told hi am to leave me and my house, because my house has became a safe place for me since i left our house. i hit my head with a bowl because i was so frustrated because he just does not want to leave me and i felt if i am that bad of a person maybe i should just died and be thisappeared from this life so i do not hurt anyone else. he told me that i rejected all the love his try to give me because i was afraid. he treated me badly when we are together. he tried to control a lot of things. he cheated on me. he made me feel afraid of speaking up. he controlled a lot of things because of his insecurities of things. i went to the hospital and the nurses and doctor were so nice to me, even the cops that took me were so nice. i was handcuffs and i was taken to the hospital in the cops car. it was scary moment of my life, because i thought they wi will take me to the jail and since they thought i drank a lot of alcohol. when i was in the hospital, the results of my alcohol was zero. the thisappointed part being in that hospital is when the social worker came and talk to me. she made me doubt myself. she told me that my alcohol level was high and she told me why is it becomes about me instead of about my nps spouse, because he the one that panic attack. first i already check in with hi am he needs anything. after i talked to her, it made me questions myself am i the crazy one? am i doing the wrong things? should i just be thisappeared from here and ran away from this hospital? . i felt terrible. i felt that i should just be gone. and until today i get so confuse who i am anymore. after i got out from the hospital, i feel better. my medication helps and i feel i have to be strong and keep going. and i have to get myself back. the person that care about other and the person that loveable. it is hard when you lost yourself in a relationship and they made you doubt yourself if you are a good person. all the guilt that people put me through, i have to start to ignore that because when they got into a condition that make them harm, it is their own decisions to do so it is not my fault. i need to learn that when people say bad things towards me and try to blame on me on the things that happened to them, i need to be strong and say that is not my decision and it is not my fault. the guilt is hunting me and i need to be better about selecting what is my fault and what is other people decisions.	moderate
first post here. desperately need help. hi, i have been lurking around here for a while, but i need to get this of my chest. i am an year old male, turning in april, in wilbur wright college in chicago. i have had depression for a while as far as i can remember, i have had it during high school. i was able to graduate, and i was able to get the star scholarship, but i feel like i dug myself into my own grave. most of the ti ame, if not all of the ti ame, i feel more dead than alive, i have no energy or strength, waking up is a chore, i am easily thistracted and lose focus too quickly, very few things make me happy, i have next to no support, and my college work has taken a big hit. last semester, i stopped doing work near the end this semester, i have not done any work at all. and the worst part? my family does not know. my mom wants me to do well, and i feel incapable of saying no, so i went to college, and i lie to her and the rest of my family about doing my homework. i know for a fact she is going to find out soon. i was lying to myself, too, trying to convince myself that everything is under control, but now, i desperately need help. i used to see a therapist starting at high school, but she just went on maternity leave lately, and i am having trouble trying to get into touch with another therapist. for some reason, i have been recently having these passive thoughts about suicide i am not planning it, but the thought is been roaming around in my head. i do not have the courage to end my life, but anything would be better than this. i have not seen my doctor in a while, maybe going there might help. i have been spending my ti ame watching stuff online, playing video games, lurking reddit, and if i am feeling in the mood, drawing, but i have not drawn for myself for a while. i am so tired of living my life in fear and apathy, but i can not find a way out of this trap. if you took the ti ame to read this, thank you for understanding, and please, whatever you want to say, say it.	moderate

i am too emotional , so stay away and i am starting to understand that is why people do not like me and leave. but i grew up in a very open community that did not shy away from telling the truth or being emotional when necessary. or at least without being judged for it. i was talking with a girl who told me her roommate said to stay away from me because i was emotional. the girl did not mean it to be rude, she just seemed surprised. her roommate was literally an ex co worker i had friendly relations with at work and never talked with outside of it. i thought we were cool. but she is friends with the same people who ostracized me while abroad, and i am getting the picture that they thought i was too emotional . but how else was i supposed to be? i was depressed and halfway across the world and entirely alone, none of them can understand because they all had friends girlfriends who came with. they made me feel worthless and then judged me more when i was sad for it. i struggle a lot, but i never bother people with my depression. i am not a toxic person, and i do not expect anyone to fix me. i am an adult and not entitled to anyone is ti ame or friendship. but am i not even entitled to my own feelings? i thought that was the one thing that was mine, but apparently i was wrong.	moderate
i can not understand why i am bothering to live anymore. i am . at the beginning of january, i was forced to come out to my homophobic, musli am parents after my mom saw a few texts on my phone basically outing me. i had an amazing boyfriend before that who helped me build myself up from previous experiences but was forced to break up and cut contact with hi am. ive been shut in ever since. only allowed to work for them when convenient for them and usually without pay for odd days and finish my a levels which i am taking for the nd ti ame since last year i was in a deep depressive slump, unable to work properly. havent sen most of my close friends since, nor am i allowed to have proper contact with them. not allowed to have a phone either since mine was taken away, and for the brief moment i had it after the fact, it was taken every night to be monitored. my parents telling me things such as we can not have a gay in the house to you are the most selfish person i have ever seen . mind you i come from a well off family. ive never done drugs, smoked, drunk or even rebelled against my parents, always done my best in my studies and so on. but suddenly i am this monstruous child. i am being made to change or else i can not live with them. if i want anything i would ever want for myself, id have to leave the house, and for an yo who isnt even being allowed to open a bank account or work, this is seemingly i ampossible. also adding to the fact that ive been sent to therapy, me finally thinking i might have a chnace to make my parents see a side i couldnt manage to convince them to, only for my mom to take solo sessions with the therapist and make me seem like some sort of sick person... living has become unbearable. i can not focus on my studies because of this mess and its the only thing that could potentially get me out of it, since they are refusing to send me where i wanted to study, but instead send me to a musli am country so that i would get straightened out . i am leading a tailored and forced life with little to no contact to the people that support me, and no opportunity to make myself so i can live on my own. i feel numb and si amply stuck.	moderate

maybe its for the best i do not exist anymore. i am on thisability getting dollars a month and feel horrible that i can not work or even find a job that i can do now. so i have to live on thisability which is degrading esp with all the stipulations they make you live by to be on it. no volunteering, no getting married, no having over dollars in savings etc. i have no family both parents died in my early to mid is no cousins, aunts, uncles, siblings. i am utterly alone in this world and if i died my body would go unfound until the neighbors reported an awful smell coming from the apartment. i live in a very small town with nothing but a few fast food places and restaurants and a walmart. no uber, no taxi, no bus. nearest small city is hours away one way and no way to get there. i just can not keep living like this. there is no point anymore to keep living. if you call this living it is more like drowning. i can not even enjoy playing video games because i have no gaming system. i do not even have a vehicle and can not get one. i been trying to save but every ti ame i do things come up like needing to get this tooth looked at which wi will cost dollars dollars from a specialist to find out if it is cancer inside the bone or not and to see if the tooth can be saved since it is the only tooth on my side i can chew on. i am in debt up to dollars , dollars from just trying to survive during the month to month with being on thisability it does not give much to survive on. i just can not do it anymore so maybe it is just for the best. i read so many people who made posts and comments on forums saying if it was not for their kids, or their wife or husband or their family members they would have ended it. hell i do not even have that.	moderate
no one wi will care, but i am quitting reddit today... i came to reddit a few months ago, in hopes that not only would this specific subreddit kinda help ease my depression, but that joining other subreddits would give me a social element that i have been missing in life also helping ease my depression. my biggest mistake was coming to reddit. outside of this subreddit, people have been unnecessarily rude, demeaning, and down right mean, for absolutely no reason. it is come to the point where every ti ame i get a reddit notification, i tense up in anticipation of someone saying something mean to me. hence why i am quitting reddit it is clearly not good for me or my depression and it is saddening to see how genuinely cruel people are in this world. i have seen a lot of people who are struggling with depression post on here. i hope you all continue down the path of overcoming this horrible mental i willness and i hope those who feel suicidal find reasons big or small to keep pushing forward in life. sending members of this subreddit nothing but positive vibes lt goodbye digital friends.	moderate

nothing helps anymore. i am so fucking scared that i am shaking all the ti ame. i feel... absolutely numb, nothing gives me relief. i literally have no wi will to live at some points and getting out of bed, acting normal, doing a routine, how? how am i supposed to keep everything up, academics, my social life, my romantic life, my doctor and therapy appointments. what is it all worth? i have tried and tried and nothing is helping, i wake up okay, and the day goes on and on and i just keep dying inside. the more hours that go by, the more tired i am of living in my own body. most of the ti ame i just want it to stop, and i wish it could. i can not bring myself to suicide obviously but someti ames i put cigarettes out on myself, and even though i hate that feeling it makes me feel something. i do not know. this is pretty much my last resort, i am sorry for having to rant to internet strangers but someti ames i seriously can not just go on like normal when inside i feel like i am being turned inside out. i am not even me anymore...	moderate
life advice to preface this, i am not diagnosed with any mental i willnesses as every ti ame ive tried to get a diagnosis its thismissed as being something related to external circumstances. so basically ive been out of education since , i am now. i was planning on doing all the gcses i wanted to but i can not focus on things and i have no motivation so i whittled it down to just english language, english lit and maths. then i decided even that was too much so i dropped everything altogether. i try and look after myself but i really dont, i sleep for like hours a day and the rest of my day is spent lying in bed looking at the wall or binge watching tv shows even though i am not really paying any attention, i go between eating one small meal a day to eating everything in the house, i can not get out of bed to brush my teeth a lot, i only wash my hair because i have a habit of picking my scalp lol. i have a good circle of friends but i feel like i dont actually like the person i am closest to but my whole social group would drop me if i ever decided to thistance myself from hi am. it doesnt help that i only really like the pursuit of friendship, i like being completely obsessed with people and if that becomes reciprocated i lose interest. i isolate myself for weeks at a ti ame and nobody even seems to care. my moods are also extremely turbulent, i will feel completely invincible for like minutes and then i will be seriously contemplating suicide and its really tiring for me, especially because i feel like i just can not talk to anyone without getting some kind of reaction, people love telling me i just want attention or they start talking about themselves when really i just want them to listen to me. my dad has had a pretty shit life as well, he suffered with a lot of mental i willnesses and addiction and all that shit, so he wants to help me and he sees my potential but i dont have the best relationship with hi am so its hard for me to let hi am do that. it doesnt help that i find it i ampossible to go to any appointments relating to my mental health, i consistently had panic attacks before them so i stopped going, and seeing all my friends going to therapy and seeing that it doesnt help them camhs lol makes me reluctant too. i have such a desire to do something meaningful with my life but every ti ame i have an interest it lasts like a week and then i am over it. its so hard i find it hard to leave the house and i also get extremely anxious and act very weird during social situations so its just not really an option for me to pursue anything. idek what i am looking for on here, i just want to feel seen ig lol xx	moderate

hopefully this is the right place to post. i always have a plan at the beginning of the semester and it always falls through after a few weeks. so each semester, i write down goals that i perceive to be achievable that i plan to stick to for the whole semester. and after about a month, i start falling through the cracks here and there until i finally just...give up. for example, this semester my goal was to exercise x a week hour each session , focus more on nourishment during eating rather than caloric intake, practice self care each day, and not use my phone until i get my homework done each day. i started slipping on the exercise, i started stress eating, i started to procrastinate...until it got to the point that i just was not even following my plan anymore. i feel like a part of this is due to the fact that college is haphazard and does not always follow a strict schedule, but i also feel like this is some deep seeded issue inside of me. so far, this issue has popped up each semester. and i am starting to think that maybe this is just inherently a flaw that i carry and can not change. i am tired of having all this determination inside me being bogged down by what seems to be depression, lack of motivation, and stress. why does this pattern keep happening? last ti ame i had a psych eval several years ago i was diagnosed with mdd, but i honestly wouldn t say i have mdd in particular anymore. i have since gone to therapy and been medicated off meds now . if anything i would say i struggle with dysthymia but i am not trying to self diagnose either.	moderate
i am years old f , new to this thread, and i am very depressed. i just do not even know why i am sad anymore. nothing specific has happened recently and i am so burned out and sad all day every day. i do not know what is making me sad so i do not know how to fix it. i just feel alone and i wish i had the energy to go out and do the things i used to love to do but i just do not anymore. i do not even care about school. and nobody seems to get or understand this feeling. i feel like i am an alien or like something is seriously wrong with me. god i just want to feel like myself again. never thought i would sound just like someone in an antidepressant commercial but that is where i am at.	moderate
is there any hope? really though, how can one ever get better when the world around them is crushing them? things are not going to get better. the future actually is bleak. fighting depression is pointless. this world caused mine and many others. it is not all in our heads. something very wrong in the way we live how could someone not get depressed? we really are powerless in this chaotic world. and that wi will never change no matter who is here ot there. human life is suffering, and those good days do not last long enough in my opinion. this is life? no this is shit	moderate
i feel lost, desperate and alone i live alone in germany, where i am learning said language to re enroll in the university. i do not know how to structurize this text but i need to get this off my chest because i not only feel lonely but i am extremely alone. i have a boyfriend who is been struggling to deal with my mood drops and panic attacks. lately everything has been falling on my back. my landlord roommate told me that his girlfriend is moving back to the city so they would want the entire apartment back, meaning that i have to find a new place to live which is stressful and very hard, i sti will have months of german lessons not cheap and i struggle so much to attend the classes , and i need to renew my visa and this all costs so much money and i sti will rely on my parents for all of this. i do not know what to do, every night is a different nightmare and i am lost and alone and do not know which decisions to make anymore, or where and how to ask for help. i do not know how to soothe this feeling anymore and it is been ki willing me everyday. i do not want to go back to my country but if i already felt like a burden to my parents back then, i most certainly feel like a bigger and more expensive one now. i just need reassurance that everything has the possibility to turn out just fine. the suicide idealizations are back at it worse than ever and i can not stop flirting with the idea of it.	moderate

i do not know if i am better started last year off at a new college and it went nothing short of badly, at the same ti ame it was joined with my onset of seasonal depression. i fought to keep my head above water, actually more literally than you think. i have changed my course and i am doing loads better but i feel so vulnerable. had a panic attack to today and the first thought i had was why am i pretending i am okay. how do i know if and when i am out of my depression. there feels like their is not a line and between each day i can slip into the void . does anyone have a metric of monitoring where they are at? is it helpful to view it as a phase? viewing at a constant... well that is just depressing	moderate
reconciling intelligence and depression i grew up gifted. got into a good university, and from the outside seem fine. people do not realize that in reality, every day is just a different kind of torture to me. i have no friends, can not keep up with hobbies, constantly behind with school work, can not fall asleep when i need to despite the fact that i spend every waking hour feeling heavy and tired. i feel inhuman. like i am suffering from i amposter syndrome of life. i feel like i do not deserve to be here. i was gifted with potential, but squandered it with depression. today i struggle with the most basic tasks. my memory recall is practically non functioning. i can not hold a conversation. i can not look people in the eye. i am always nervous. i can not take care of myself. i do not know what to do. i want guidance but i wi will always be alone in this struggle.	moderate
i only experience joy or peace when i drink alcohol i think i might be suffering from depression. i feel like crying several ti ames a day and it takes a lot of effort to suppress it in front of other people. as mentioned, iately i tend to only experience joy or peace when i drink mostly beer, wine or take light drugs weed, shrooms . i stay away from hard drugs and alcohol. for a bit of background, i grew up in a dysfunctional family, my mother went missing when i was , my father handed me and my brother over to social services a year or so after. i struggled in a children is foster home where my brother and i were only numbers, suffered from the psychological abuse by the people who were supposed to take care of us. eventually when i hit i left, had to stand in front of the tribunal to get my brother into my custody. i was accepted at the university, also had to work a lot to sustain us. there were people who helped a little, my older half sister financially from ti ame to ti ame, my boyfriend is family practically, my boyfriend emotionally, otherwise i do not think i would be able to manage. i somehow finished my masters and started working. just as when i was thinking my life can be a bit normal, my brother attempted suicide and was diagnosed with a severe mental i willness. i continued to take care of hi am and he got better and was able to function, so i decided to do something i have always wanted to do and go and work abroad. i sti will support my brother financially, but he started living by hi amself at the age of . starting in a new country, huge stress, but i found a decent job, very stressful, decent money, not good enough to be able to ever purchase a house, but enough to get by if you rent. the daily , hour work week, utilization targets and the nobody gives a damn about you culture has really started getting to me though and cherry on the top of the cake is the fact that brother has been recently hospitalized after another return of his i willness. he wi will probably never be ok. i just can not cope anymore. stress, anxiety about the future, painful childhood memories, remorse over not being with my brother when he needs me and anger that he wi will probably always be dependent on me, anger that the lack of family support network places all the load on my shoulders, that it is always me that has to be strong, always me who has to cope, always me who has to make compromises when it comes to my life, whether it is about the area of study i had to stay in my home town to take care of my brother, instead of pursuing a more interesting degree elsewhere , being able to stay abroad and other. i have never been and never wi will be free. i did not choose the majority of events that shaped my life. i chose to go abroad and can not even enjoy that because i feel remorse that i am not fully there for my brother. if i had the choice, i would have chosen not to be born. i think about death often, but i also think about the pain it would cause to the few people who care. so i am locked in this vicious circle and day by day i am getting more tired, more sad, more apathetic. i lack energy to change things. energy to pursue things that used to fulfi will me. energy to search for a new job. i tried therapy last year, when i was very stressed, shortly after my first ever panic attack and it was not really helpful, so i am not planning to do it again. i get that some other people have it worse. my brother probably has it worse. people who were physically abused and violated have it worse. that is causing self loathing. i should not be feeling this way. but i do. is there anything that can be done to change the way i feel? i do not want to muddle my brain with meds. and my childhood trauma is going to stay unless someone invents a ti ame machine and prevent my parents from breeding. i just entered my thirties and everyone is telling me how great life is going to be. i find it hard to believe.	moderate
feeling back to square one after coming off escitalopram hi all, i went on mg escitalopram about months ago for anxiety depression. it made a big difference and i felt much better so i stayed on it until last month when my gp and i decided to taper off it to avoid being on it too long term. i slowly tapered off and was feeling fine until i completely stopped weeks ago. i am now feeling really bad again, with all the same symptoms i had before i feel like how i did before i went on the meds which is very frustrating. is this common for a withdrawal? i have only been off it for weeks better, wi will i start to feel more normal again or is this likely to be permanent without the escitalopram? thanks	moderate
the definition of doing nothing a few days ago i met up with two friends i have not seen in a while. of course the uncomfortable question about what i am lately doing came up. well i do a lot of nothing lately, like literally nothing. i lay in bed with closed eyes someti ames with open eyes. my head is either an endless void fi willed with nothing or some horrible chaos fi willed with negativ thoughts. or i scroll thru reddit without really paying attention because i actually just try to avoid thinking shitty thoughts. so i said i do a lot of nothing lately. these two friends do not know about my depression and one said back that he is also doing a lot of nothing. but what he meant was gaming, watching series and so on. i felt to embarrassed to clarify what i truly meant. explaining to someone else what i really do all day is just to sad. another thing i noticed is that if i have a day of doing nothing by my friends definition i see these days as kinda productive because i did something instead of nothing. kinda weird how my definition of doing nothing kinda shifted more and more into the literally meaning of the word. it makes me feel like a very small person when i think about the things i perceive as small successes at this point. like when i get myself to play a video game, watching a tv show even if it is just for an hour or si ample things like taking a shower. other people see these things as doing nothing all day...	moderate
depression is an addiction every ti ame you think you re fine, you relapse before it really counts. how many ti ames do you pick yourself up after rock bottom before you see the pattern? it is an addiction to destroying yourself, an addiction to nothing, to being empty, or whatever it is to you. it took me years to start thinking about it this way and only once i did was i able to finally truly help myself... but i keep relapsing back to this. when i pick myself up, i count the days where i stay away from destroying my life the days where i avoid sleeping all day and missing exams and pushing people away so far my record is months with only minor blips. but now it resets. i guess we ll see what happens.	moderate
comeback from the worst day of my life yesteryday was a huge low. i talked to my guidance counselor at my tech school and after expressing thoughts of suicide she required me to go to my local hospital and make me feel like a fucking basket case. how the fuck did i even get here. once i was in a hospital room they wanted me to get naked in a gown and socks and they wouldn t allow me to leave which was making me freak the fuck out. i just wanted some calm family counceling or something. that night after telling my best friend what happened he invited me to help hi am with stage crew which we were fucking around during and having a fun old ti ame just messing around like good old ti ames. flash forward to today and i am feeling okay but i am just hoping these thoughts which seem to be getting worse leave me alone now that the school is way too involved in my business.	moderate

feeling stuck, at a standsti will i am feeling stuck today. unable to move forward, so i thought maybe i should get a bunch of garbage off my mind to see if that helps. it frequently does. i guess my experience of what i think is depression, or something like it, is maybe a little different and tamer than what a lot of people here might be going through. i have trouble getting motivated, focusing. it is someti ames, but not always or even usually marked by sadness. that, or i have just gotten so used to being sad that i can not tell the difference anymore. that idea ... feels like it has merit and scares me a little. i know i have dealt with this ... whatever it is and whatever label really applies, off and on throughout my life. i know both my parents struggled with it, particularly my dad who probably sti will does. i graduated into the last recession. had a hard ti ame finding a job. i did what i could. before, physical fitness had been really i amportant to me, but that fell off. i was in a relationship throughout that ti ame, school and after. even as i struggled to find a job i got a lot of pressure from family, friends, and the woman i was seeing to get married. looking back i do not know why nobody had my back on that. why they did not pull me aside and say they could see what was going on with me and that maybe this is not the best decision to make under the circumstances. i went ahead with it, found a good job, performed well, and started to feel better though. there had always been issues with my relationship though, and everything i heard and experienced and felt about myself put me in a place of you d better take what you can get. so i did not do a good job of setting boundaries or standing up for myself, and my idea of working on my relationship was essentially complaining about the same problem s over and over again rather than recognizing that there is a ti ame when you should really just end it after you have made your needs and expectations clear. i was in a pretty dark place after graduation though, and there was a lot of pressure, so i went through with it knowing there were problems because i essentially believed i was not worth more than how i was being treated. what i wanted and needed did not matter. through professional success, easing of financial tension i gradually i amproved. i found hobbies and started taking care of myself a little better again. made new friends. my marriage was not happy though. i kept talking and trying, but it just was not quite right. i was unhappy and vulnerable, and someone found me and gradually a friendship turned into an emotional affair. i found myself happy in a way i had not felt in a long ti ame. i found hope for a better future. i felt things i did not think i could feel. it went on for a little less than a year. i struggle with how i felt, if it was all brain chemistry, if i found someone who was genuinely able to meet my mental and emotional needs. if i was happy because i was actually happy, actually getting what i needed. that ended and was rough, but i moved on and now i am really aware of all the years that have passed. that i have wasted on a relationship that did not work, and i find myself really preoccupied with being jealous, even resentful of happy couples. people who come home to someone happy to see them, someone affectionate. i do not have that. i never have. i was always kind of a loner, but now i find myself struggling with feelings of loneliness. i have found things that help. in particular working out. that gives me a strong sense of wellbeing. it lifts me a bit, makes me feel more alive, positive, and enthusiastic. i try to make it a priority. but there are days like today when i should be getting work done, and i just can not. i can not focus. my mind feels like it is in a fog. i feel alone, and i look around and i feel both trapped, but at the same ti ame i see that maybe this is not what my life should be and that i just need to make th choice to change it. but that change means losing a lot. in particular, my kid. at least half that ti ame. that is a thought i can barely process. that is all, i just wanted to think out loud. i just feel stuck, and isolated, and i am having trouble pulling it together and getting through the day. nothing feels quite right, just feels kind of hollow and unfulfi willing.	moderate
i have been sitting idle at my computer with no music on for over two hours and i just realized that i more depressed than i like to admit. i am thinking what to write, because i no longer know what i should be feeling, i am alone. someti ames it feels as if i am walking into a snowy forest, as the frosting breeze touches my face just to keep me alive and sane. people used to call me interesting, but they never put in the effort to get to know me. people used to chat with me, they no longer do. people used to see me smile, now they are not even around to see me cry. i am a mess, with no friends, my family does not support me and make me look like shit. to be quite frank, i am tired. i, milvoltage, curse each day i woke up and wi will wake up in the future. i pray to god, with all my heart that he finds it in his heart to put me out of my misery, i pray that one day i wi will go to sleep and it wi will be the last ti ame i wi will think about this endless ugly cycle that we call life . please god, if you exist, prove that you exist and take me with you, i no longer wish to stay here.	moderate
not able to get life back on track, can not stay sober hello, well its difficult and unnecessary to explain my whole history to you guys so i will just keep it to a mini amum. i have had three pretty messed up years. self harmed a lot, started feeling depressed, turned out to be suicidal, tried ti ames, extremely reckless, drug abuse. i am happy to say i havent really felt that way in a long ti ame. its a thing i wanted so long, to just feel alright. well. unfortunately it is not as good as i thought it would be. i was clean for like a month. then i started again. now i am trying to stay sober again. last ti ame i used abused molly and weed was the beginning of this week. well it turns out that those two substances make me feel a little bit better. but my tolerance is so high that its way too expensive to use it, and too dangerous i amo. like i said, i am trying to stay sober and get my life back on track. again. ive tried so often but i si amply can not give up, even though i have thisappointed myself and my previous friends too often. i am years old and sti will studying. i am not going to lie, its exhausting for me to keep up with everything. its almost i ampossible for me. and one of my biggest problems at the moment is that i can not be sober. can not be sober? yes. i guess i am addicted to not being sober? ive always used something to be able to get through tough ti ames. it feels like i am always a little bit beneath the level of feeling okay. i am always seeking for that little piece of happiness that i can not find. i do not really ask for much. i do not need to be the most happiest person alive. but it sucks when you need a substance to feel less horrible. so currently i just do not have a clue how to get my life back together. its been such a huge mess, seems i ampossible to get out of it. facts are that i am going to have to graduate, and keep my mess a secret. i am just not sure where to start. and my mind keeps and confusing me. one day i am fine, the other day i am thinking about using other substances to numb the pain. i am actually thinking about switching to xanax. do not know if it works but it should at least do something good. and since last week i am starting to feel like i am going back to those three years. it feels like i am becoming depressed again, which sucks. its probably really confusing what ive written down. to be honest i do not even understand it myself. is there anyone who might have some tips for me, or some kind of idea what i am supposed to do? if i do what my thoughts tell me to i am sure i am not going to last long, so any support is much appreciated and feel free to ask me anything if i left something out.	moderate
pretending everything is ok does anyone else ever silently scream inside of their head even when they are outwardly smiling and dealing with things? those instances are increasing for me. i have three children and can not give in but my goodness it is hard when everything seems to be going wrong all of the ti ame. i am emotionally and physically exhausted, spiritually and financially broken and feel like i am walking on quicksand. my eldest son is having a really hard ti ame recently, and he is only ten. i am falling over myself to support hi am and i would honestly walk through fire for hi am but i wish there was someone there to support me. i would love a hug and for someone else to make the decisions for a change. i do not want to decide whether to eat or heat the house. i do not want to decide whether to buy new needed shoes for myself or pay for a school outing. i am so fucking lonely and worried to death that i am messing up my children.	moderate
everything is a bit too much and i feel mentally drained all of the ti ame. i m have gone to therapy in the past because i felt depressed and suicidal. it helped me a bit and they put me on meds i sti will am to try and li amit the intensity of my downs. the thing is that i feel numb and barely human compared to everyone else because i am just constantly neutral to everything that happens and i guess that, having my feelings numbed kind of helped me hide them better from people i care about. i like helping people though, they are pretty much the only reason i am sti will here, because i do not want to hurt them. only, these past few weeks, i am feeling myself slipping and relapsing into depression again. it is like i am just not made for it. like i just do not belong here. i consider ending someti ames, i just do not want to make people around me go through grief or feel guilty about my passing. i thus, put myself in danger someti ames, hoping to die in an accident or something so i do not seem like a selfish prick. i am seriously tired of being like this, drained even. i just want it to stop, i want to rest my mind and feel at peace with myself. you guys and gals have a nice one, take care of yourselves.	moderate

depression is like a pitstop you go through life on a circular path, all corners and straights, accelerating and slowing down, winning and losing, competing and cooperating, but once in a while something breaks, something does not work as it should, something needs to be replaced, repaired. and that is why we have to go to pitstop stop, fix something and keep going again as the race is sti will running.	moderate
which way is up? which way is out? f here. been struggling with depression i think most of my life. led me to some serious alcohol abuse issues over the past couple years. cut that out for a month at the beginning of the year, relapsed, and am now days sober. started taking mg lexapro december . resigned lost my job about months ago. with mini amal tethers to the outside world i have been withdrawing and avoiding more and more. i do not answer text messages until days later, someti ames never. i can not even manage to take my car to get a desperately needed oil change. i sleep all the ti ame. even after a full hours i wi will someti ames take a nap during the day. i have absolutely no routines. i barely eat, or if i do i crave sweets maybe bc of cutting out alcohol . i am not sad, per se. i am apathetic. i feel nothing except occasionally guilty and bad about myself, that i am not strong enough to pull myself out of the malaise . when i do feel something, it is negative and i usually take it out on my bf by starting dumb fights bc he is the only one around. nothing seems interesting, nothing seems worthwhile. my savings would not last forever, so i need to make some moves to get a new job but it seems sooo daunting . it is like i can not bring myself to do anything. i have been suicidal before but do not even have drive for that. i feel passive. i just hope i randomly have a brain aneurysm and die alone in my apartment, leaving my cat to survive by eating my eyeballs and squishy bits. at least then i would be useful for something. which way is up? which way is out? have you ever felt like this? did it last forever? how did you motivate yourself to do anything? what is the point?	moderate
only an advice for depression .insult the voice inside of you and insult her back, with the same severity as she goes on with you. .try to thistract yourself, even if you do not feel any joy in doing so. you have to learn joy again. .food supplements htp, vitamin c, vitamin d , omega , rosacea, multivitamin caution when combining htp with pharmaceutical products as it can have serious side effects i myself have also been in a depression for about years. i am trying to give you tips because we re all in it together. if necessary, it wi will help you and we wi will manage to defeat the thisease.	moderate

not made for this life? everybody born is made for life, but it is about what kind of life you face. i personally think i am not made for this life. society takes a huge part. i do not need anything big, i just want to be happy with who i am. i do not need mi willions. i just want to appreciate little things, without trying to find a reason to feel bad. i have a family and friends that really love me. but i sti will can not accept myself. there is everybody for everything absurd on this earth. so how is it so unlikely that there is somebody just not made for this kind of life? is there anybody feeling the same way? my deepest wish is to just be able to accept who i am, accept everything in this life and just live like everyone else. but i just can not. i am just years old, the normal reaction would be you re so young, get help , maybe someone wi will understand why that is just not an option. what are your thoughts on that? my english is not the best, i am sorry if i left any mistakes.	moderate
on pain and lessons i always tried to find some meaning in pain and a lesson to learn from it. and i think it is all random and the only thing it did for me was turn me into an ani amal that is surviving but not really a human anymore. the only thing i am good at is staying alive, but i take no enjoyment out of it. the happy ti ames are so few and insignifican not, it feels like hard labor for crumbs. the emotional pain becomes physical when i can not get my muscle to relax or my chest to expand and breathe normally. i try to comfort myself and zone out and realize a memory made me clench and scratch myself. thinking about what i could do to make me a better person stresses me out until i am crying because the list is so long. i cling obsessively to my pets because someti ames the only thing i stay alive for is that they would not understand if one day i just did not come home... pain is so...random. it never really had a purpose or lesson. i just survive it and it changes me. and then i survive the person i am afterward.	moderate

this sub wi will not help everyone but some guess this place is not for everyone. i guess someone might even assume i am seeking attention. but anyway, things dont work same way for everyone. for some this place helps, others it doesnt. for me, i would say it only made my emotions even more unstable. it made me remember things i wanted to forget. so ye, someti ames things dont works so i wi will be leaving. hopefully professional help might work so i ammma try that. thanks for letting me read a bunch of interesting stuffs though. seeing people who think a bit like me and seeing people who think in other unique ways. good luck.	moderate

sad vs depression depression runs in my family and i recently had a relative attempt suicide. i do not know if i am sad or have depression. for the last few years i have felt these same same emotions but last few months it is gotten worse. lately, i felt so... hopeless. i feel like everything around me is crumbling to pieces. my relationships with people around me are deteriorating, my grades are falling, i have gained a lot of weight from emotional eating, i feel alone and isolated. when i try my hardest i feel like i am knocked down again. i just want to give up. i am so tired of feeling this void of emptiness. i want to be happy but things that once made me happy do not bring me the same joy. there are days where i go to the bathroom and just cry. i want to be happy and i want to have healthy relationships. i do not know what to do	moderate
one day last night i just wanted to sleep forever. this entire week i have just not been able to sleep feeling tired and alienated and i do not like anyone. kitchen was really messy and smelly and my plants were dying and i had three to pot from when i bought them when i was manic. today i decided to do the thishes and repot my plants. my plants are repotted and most of the thishes are in the thishwasher. i wi will get through today. when i get home i wi will finish the thishes, vacuum, and take the trash out. i wi will clean the counters. tomorrow i wi will take a day off of work unpaid. financially it wi will be a bit hard but i need a chance to sleep.	moderate
i kind of like being sad?? so i am usually always sad and someti ames i can feel myself like draining energy out of whatever room i am in because i am just quiet and sad and slumped and while i hate feelings like i am sucking the energy out of everything i do however almost like feeling so sad and blue and gloomy like when i am by myself and just being sad and everything appears gray i kind of like it?? does anyone else feel like this? i can not even i amagine what its like to not feel so sad or suicidal even like what do you do? i know this might not be a good comparison but its like when victi ams get stockholm syndrome with their kidnappers its like me with my sadness like i kind of like just feeling gray and cloudy and sad and in my own world. but at the same ti ame someti ames it gets so bad that i just want to die and it feels literally horrible like i can barely bare it and i do not know how to explain it when it gets that bad for close to that bad but usually i am in a state where i can laugh if i am with my sister but if i am anywhere where i do not have to try to be funny i am either sad or just not feeling anything. anyways right now i am not feeling anything like i am not sad but i am definitely not happy i am kinda just here. it is like i am alive but for what? like theres nothing i have to live for. i am not suicidal rn but like theres nothing to look forward to. i do not know what i am saying but i would really like know if theres anyone who feels like this so sorry if i just sound stupid	moderate
i feel nothing... any advice i have felt emotionally numb for years now i think. even when i get a gli ampse of emotion i feel like such a failure and loser that my mind just numbs itself again. right now i am living my first year out of high school and i do not know what to do. i feel so stressed out and have a mi willion things to do but all i can think about is my mental health and trying to be a normal person again. my personality is completely gone and i feel like a shell of who i use to be. my voice is so low that i have been told i almost whisper when i talk. along with that i can not get interested in anything. i can not even watch a movie. i am apathetic to everything and anything could happen to me and i wouldn t have a reaction. in fact about a year ago a friend of mine i use to talk to everyday the year before, committed suicide and i felt absolutely nothing. and i sti will do not. also some of the other effects i have had my memory is completely terrible now and have a hard ti ame remembering what i did the other day. also idk if anyone else has this but i also do not notice things anymore. when i was not like this i would notice when a cute girl looks at me or flirts alittle bit, now i wouldn t notice anything like the sort. i feel autistic when i talk to people. i do not have anything to add and i feel robotic the couple of friends i have are off to college so i would not see them until summer and i can not make any friends being a shell of a person with no personality. my father is semi emotionally abusive and i never have ti ame to myself when home. i have tried talking to a therapist but it didint work. i have tried getting anti depressants but the only ones that they wi will give me wi will make my vision worse i have visual snow so i do not want to take them. this is my first post ever and idk what i am doing. i just would appreciate some advice on what to do.	moderate
happiness i spend most of my days thinking of happiness, not my happiness, but my lack of it. i can not remember the last ti ame i was happy, the last ti ame i felt accomplished or fulfi willed. i put on a smile but i do not know if i wi will ever feel genuinely happy again, which in turn makes me question if my life is even worth it. i am so tired and i just need this game to be over.	moderate
dead inside almost and i have no reason to live anymore, but i would not ki will myself because i do not have what it takes. the more i think about my dreams, the more i am sick of this shitty life although i have everything to have a normal life but i do not want it. i am alone, nobody to talk with, my mom wants me to have a job, my dad my driver licence, i do not care about both i just want to be happy but i am always happy for minute and then it is gone. i became thistant with my only friends and i do not want to talk with them again. that is how friendship is. i am fucking tired of myself for not having the motivation and the trust i need to accomplish what i want to do. i feel i am dead inside. that is what depression feels, you feel nothing. neither happy nor sad. just sittin on my chair thinkin bout what should i do next, but i already know the answer like my life	moderate

i want to ki will myself but have no one to tell me no. hello reddit, this is the first ti ame i wi will be using this site to post someone of my own. about months ago i told my mom i wanted to ki will myself. she did not care and told me that i do not have a mental i willness i am just sad. then i tried to talk to her about it over text at the ti ame i was not home and she left me on read. now months later i really feel like ki willing myself again. but i felt that maybe someone could relate to me and maybe try to help me. if i do not get help then i plan to ki will myself on the train tracks at am tomorrow morning. since that is around the ti ame i usually wake up and the station is around mins away from my house. i did everything i wanted to do before i died. played some games with my friends and hung out with my cats. had lunch with my dad. i can not stand the idea of telling my dad he is been such a good father to me i rather die than hurt hi am in such a way. well that is my story reddit. do with it as you wi will.	moderate
i think i have depression, for months now decided to ask people about it so i would like to start with a story that is a bit controversy since it is about cheating.. i wi will be in days, i am a male. i had really tough ti ame in october, but then came a girl that she was my friend already, we known about each other from pri amary school but we get to know each other due to the university. i am in my nd year, she is in her first. so she has a boyfriend, for more than , year, we were friends, but when i was down back then she made me happy always and we came closer and closer to each other and it happened. she cheated and said that she loves us both, we were very fine, we had sex only twice but slept together very often and she always huged me and i felt that i am loved. in december she said she needs ti ame to decide what she wants, always asked her so what do we have between us and if she wi will break up with her bf. i felt really sad for the guy since i get to know hi am as well. so in january she started to keep thistance from me and i asked her to always be honest to me, she told everything even if she went to her bf to sleep together and you know... ti ame passed and we are best friends, at least for me she is since my long ti ame friends forgot me and do not talk to me any more and she even told me that for her i am her best friend. she know that i wanted more and i told her enough that i do not just like her as a friend and she used to tell me that too. now i am feeling hopeless not just because that but because i feel like i am not loved, i have lost so many friends they are not died just ignoring me before we really got closer to each other i be had plans how to ki will myself and i wrote that down. option. first since i have sleeping problems i have many sleeping pi wills allowed by doctor, and would try to overdose it with alcohol and jump down from a building, i even checked the place where can i do that the second option is chloroform and rope. i feel like i have personality, one is happy with her being my very best friend and wants her to be happy with her bf and the other is wants her to be with me and be happy together. ive considered to option, to break the contact with her so i can move on in terms of love and the other is try to adapt but then my other self is being hurt. so i am once again wrote down those suicide option and thinking about committing it very strongly. i see hope that we can be together someti ame since we talk and meet each other everyday, but i am the other hand i know it would not happen. she is not hugging me the way anymore, not cuddling while we watch movies and i really feel like noone loves me. i was very religious person, went to church sadly just someti ames but prayed and stuff often, now even if i think about god i do not do that, does not feel that it can help me. to sum up, i have lodt friends but have a new one who is makes me happy and sad at the same ti ame and see no other option than end it all since i lodt it all.	moderate

unworthy i am so drained. i feel so little. even the moments that are supposed to be positive are trumped by my relentless lack of happiness. why am i unworthy? why can i not soar like the others? why can not i like myself or believe in myself? i put so much effort into things and no matter what i always end up thisappointed. i witnessed someone i love slowly thisintegrate to such a brutal thisease. i have been unemployed for several months. the person i love has given up on me. nothing wi will be in my favor. i am meant to be sad. i am meant to feel small.	moderate
signs of depression? throughout the past year i have felt extremely down. i go to school, which can be a mixed emotion day. come back and i feel lonely af. i am one of the only people in my year who have not had a relationship, and i am just constantly told i am ugly, or have a big head, or scrawny. i bought weights for christmas, but ever since then i have been mocked for it. whether it is me playing football or rugby, or minding my own business, someone always has a comment to make. i have never been someone is bestest friend and always feel like the outsider in a group. throughout school i had been bullied extremely, being burned with bunsen burners, head smashed into a door, the lot. i finally find a group of friends i like, but i sti will feel down, all the ti ame. i come home, go to bed, and sleep. at ti ames i think about suicide, but always know i wouldn t as i would never want to upset my family or my friends . but one thing i do know is if my family was gone, i would do it. i am not sure if this is depression or just a hard ti ame. i am just fed up of not feeling happy anymore.	moderate

i think, therefore i am in a si amulation life seems like such a twisted sick game. i wouldn t be at all surprised if choosing to end your own life leads to having to do it all over again because there is some unwritten rule we re not aware of that says you do not get to choose when . when i think back over the last years of my life and how much of that ti ame was fi willed with angst and depression. how lonely i was as a child, the violence, the abuse, the everyday battle to keep going.. and for what? i had a religious upbringing but those teachings sound so far away from reality. what i can not get my head around is how a merciful god would end the life of those in the wrong religions, wtf! and does anyone know which one is the right one? this shit must be a si amulation! i have been on the slide for a while and i wish it was all over. i think about my worklife before the suicide and the months stay in hospital but i just feel so scarred by it all, i know i wouldn t cope going back, i can barely look after myself ffs, i am just not ready yet but change might be coming whether i like it or not.	moderate
i am in a dark place right now as i am writing this, tears are coming out my eyes because i am so fed up with life. when do things get better? so much drama and it is exhausting. i try to convince myself that i can get through this but deep down i am sinking further and further into the cold abyss. thoughts about suicide are creeping in my mind although i would never do it and i am fantasizing about it. how easy it would be to just end the suffering but then i remember my loved ones and i could never do that to them. everything is exhausting. so exhausting.	moderate
i have lost all my interests i have been depressed for about months now and for the past weeks i have lost all interest in pretty much all of my hobbies and now i just spend most of my days either laying in bed listening to music or forcing myself to do things i like before like playing video games. i do not like to talk to people anymore, and when people ask if everything is good i just tell them it is a lack of sleep. i have cried myself to sleep for the past days.	moderate
the so called help for depression lies behind an amount of effort long title because i did not really know how to put that and more of a rant because i need to. considering that a large part of what depression is has completely shut me down to the point where i am completely failing to study in a field i actually am super interested in and enjoy working on computer games development if you want to know . now a week or two ago i got a email from university saying i am being withdrawn from the course, and to my high surprise i actually got myself upright and got in contact with the student association. i know have the form to appeal it.. the multipage document with pixel writing on every page requiring huge amounts of detailed writing with cited evidence that i also need to actually gather. i have like weeks before it gets auto rejected. with all that in mind, this appeal form is directed in part at people with mental health issues and how can i possibly be expected to deal with that in such a tiny ti ame frame. i wouldn t go with continuing my course if i did not feel i was getting better overall, and thusly am sure i can pass fairly easily next year. now though with this bloody thing in my way i am caving right back in, losing months of progress and do not know what to do with my life, to the point of coming up shorter than ever on reasons to continue it. spent a fair hour or so contemplating posting to r suicidewatch or here, but decided since i had at least a few days left in me i would leave that sub for later. i do not really know either what i am ai aming to achieve with this post since i can not really think of anything i would respond to this sort of post if i saw other people post it. sorry for the rant, but needed to get that out my system odd really considering it contains the very point that i am finding severe difficulty writing out that bloody appeal form .	moderate

what are you actually supposed to do if you re suicidal? tw mentions of suicide from this point on for years now, i have dealt with my own battle of depression and self loathing but i was able to always get myself out of whatever rut i would fall into. growing up a lot of people around me dealt with suicidal thoughts and i have had the suicide talk multiple ti ames. it never bothered me personally because i never reached that point where i felt the same way so if course i was wi willing to help. i used to say my anxiety was the thing keeping me alive cause of my irrational fear of what comes after death but now i do not feel as protected. actual suicidal thoughts exist in my brain and now there is positives i consider when thinking about it. i have become so mean to myself i catch myself thinking how much of a waste i am and how much better everyone and everything would be if i was just dead. i am always brought back to reality and i count out all the reasons i need to stay alive for but it is just hard accepting that you yourself are suicidal, especially when you have spent years trying to help other people. what are you actually supposed to do if you re suicidal? you try telling someone you run the risk of going to a hospital, spending a shit ton of money talking to professional and get some medication? try telling you re family and they wi will look at you differently and walk on egg shells around you until yomu re better. what if there is never a better ti ame that comes? and every ti ame you re surrounded by the people you love being happy and every ti ame something goes wrong and you think you should just ki will yourself cause you re a goddamn burden to the world itself, how can you look your family in the eye when that is the only thing you can think about during a family gathering? everyone is always happy and you re the one sitting away from everyone else cause you can not ever be that happy. seems like the only cure is medication right? or just half your life suffering until it just stops?	moderate
i might be homeless soon and i could not care less. i think i have finally hit the point where i just do not care anymore. i am just so tired, and even if i am not homeless soon i wi will be at some point so why not now. i have no friends, no family, a shitty part ti ame job i hate, no ski wills or degree. no matter what i do nothing changes, i am destined for it so why fight it anymore. i was meant to die penniless in a gutter. i feel sorry for whoever had to deal with my body though, maybe i wi will just find a nice forest to go lay down in and die there. at least the environment can reclai am my useless body. kind of a bummer that my parents had me, they could have had a doctor or something equally as good but nope. just me, damn i was bringing people down before i was even born.	moderate
year long isolation and depression. hey, so i want to put how i feel and what i think out somewhere and maybe someone with si amilar problems can relate, i appreciate any advice you can give me or others, everybody on here probably had to deal with isolation before, but i did that shit for like at least a year, not talking to people at all and not doing much, i completely broke and developed a lot of issues, like not being able to think clearly, feeling out of person and gone from the world, if anybody has any idea how i can get past these issues and back to before i isolated myself, i would really appreciate it, you could actually save my life, i need help badly, thank you for reading, and if anyone relates i would like to hear what you think and what you have been through, so feel free to reach out, i would not judge, i promise.	moderate
i wish people would understand that just because they saw me smile does not mean i was happy. i rarely ever actually smile. it is often forced and fake, it is getting more and more tiring the more i do it and it is getting annoying. what is even worse is that even if i put on the most fake smile they wouldn t assume a thing and think i am all fine and dandy. everything hurts but in order for them to think i am okay i wi will continue smiling even though behind that smile is just someone who wants to be set free and removed from this world.	moderate

it is like someone out there is trying to hurt me for the past year and a half literally every ambition that i have had has collapsed on itself. four ti ames, i have gotten close with a girl, and i think we re really hitting it off, and suddenly they stop texting me. like a pattern, we text a lot, we start hanging out, going on dates, and then they just stop responding to me. i try everything i can do to fix it but i can not. it is a never ending cycle. i have been rejected from my dream school, even after one of the professor is there came to my mom to talk about how good my audition for their program was, and how much he would like me at the school. this of course, comes after four other rejections, for good measure. i recently learned that one of my friends has been talking behind my back, which i was kind of aware of, but i did not want to believe until now. we got into a little argument recently not because of hi am talking about me, but i was already mad at hi am for that, and that made me lash out at hi am more , and even though we re good now, i can not even look at hi am in the face anymore without getting a little pissed off. my life feels like it is falling apart. i am so jealous of all my friends, they all have significan not others who they care about and who care about them, almost all of them are set for their futures, it makes me feel like a piece of rotting fruit. everyday passes and my life just keeps getting worse. it is like, someone is trying to hurt me, trying to destroy me emotionally, someone with a vendetta against me. it sounds crazy, but i have been thinking about this more and more, and it honestly just makes sense, everything in my life just turns against me. i wish i could pause my life, just for a week, just to at least deal with everything before more shit comes my way. i hate being so self pitying, but it is hard not to feel this way with everything going on.	moderate

how did i end up here? y.o male... who feels like i absolutely nothing in life. the only thing that makes me feel even remotely better is sleeping my life away and even then, i have dreams about how depressed i am. from the outside looking in, no one would be able to tell how fucking destroyed i am on the inside. i have nothing. i hate my job and i was just skipped over for a promotion and it was given to a co worker who has been there half the ti ame i have. i have never had a girlfriend. i have no friends. i am literally a fucking loser and i do not do anything to try to help myself. i am dollars , in debt. i have no interests or hobbies or anything. i think listening to music is the only thing keeping me alive at this point. honestly. i do not think i can ever ki will myself because i understand that this could be temporary and things could potentially get better.... but literally all i think about all day, every day, is how i just do not want to be here anymore. it is too lonely and it is too depressing. fuck man. i am so sad.	moderate

i am unhappy with my weight and it is ruining my life. what is wrong with me? i can not do anything without worrying about how big i look. i feel like when people look at me, they think one word squishy. it has been bothering me for years now, since i first lost weight when i was . what happened was i found out my mom had cheated on my dad and they divorced. i was an only child until i was , so i was devastated. my mom was abusive towards both my dad and me. i vividly remember the first ti ame meeting my moms now husband home wrecker and his kids at a nice pizza place. i did not eat anything, and it kinda became a habit. not sure why i kept on or why i started it. i remember my mom yelling and accusing me of having an eating thisorder and i was just appalled she would think that. i really did not know how much weight i was losing, until i weighed pounds at . i remember feeling beyond happy, there really has never been another feeling like it. i remember my mom bringing me food to my bedroom so i would eat. i absolutely refused to eat in front of people. i ate a lot of salad. when i started gaining weight back, i hated myself. my self esteem wi will not go back to what it was. my weight pattern is stupid. . i have been forever bouncing between wanting to be healthy and strong, and being thin. it is like a constant battle in my head everyday and i never have any idea which one i wi will go with when i wake up. i sti will really struggle with eating in public, but my fianc has played a huge role in making me feel comfortable enough. without hi am there i am a wreck and can not do it. all i can do is think about how i am going to lose the weight, what kind of diet i am going to try, how many calories should i be eating, etc. and it is miserable. i feel like such a loser and like i am a liar. the worst part is how hard it is to lose weight. i can do the exact same things as i used to, and it would not come off. i am a failure, a fraud. i i ampulsively bought an echelon two weeks ago and all i can think about is how lazy i am for skipping days. i burst a blood vessel in my eye from throwing up because i overate, and proceeded to hop on the echelon for miles. i usually only do , so now i can not help but feel pathetic for not doing everyday. i have been so irritable everyday and it is gotten to the point where my fianc coughing makes me snap. i am years old, and now weigh , which is down pounds. once i get back to i wi will feel so much better, but it is such an awful ride so far. it has been a long years. i have been depressed ever since that first ti ame i lost weight, and i am not sure which came first. i look through all my notebooks, emails and pictures, and the majority of it is about diets, measurements, weight loss accounts, and progress pictures. i have no hobbies anymore and i just feel so sad angry numb. i blame the sadness and wanting to lose weight for why i smoke and have no intentions of quitting. what is wrong with me? how can i stop? also i am sorry that this got too long. i do not know if this makes any sense to anyone because it sure does not to me. thanks if you read this!	moderate
i am ki willing myself at midnight it is all just pointless. it is been years since i have felt happiness. it is been years since i have been hugged, cuddled with, or felt any sort of physical affection. i just want her back more than anything else in the world. i have not met a single girl half as cute pretty beautiful as her, or half as amazing to be around. life without love has no meaning and i am fucking sick of it. i do not want the whole you have got stuff to live for shit. without love none of it is worth living for. i am just using my last hours to look at pictures of us together since it is the only thing that brings me any sort of happiness.	moderate

pretending to be perfect for a long ti ame, even know , i always act like i am fine and well put together, for the most part. i have had my ups and down like anyone else has had through their lives however when i hit college i went through an extreme depression which resulted in self harm and lots of drug abuse. i felt extremely inadequate , difficult getting out of bed, no energy to stay up for more than a couple of hours and very meticulous with my meals. but after seeing my mom and dad cry and my siblings concerns, i changed and slowly i thought i was getting better. fast forward to now, i am fasting when i can, some days i up my intakes on laxatives because i hate knowing something is in my stomach, have negative harmful thoughts,want to sleep for days and not feel the need to get up and bathe, and drive off to who knows where for long periods of ti ame and lie stating that i am hanging with friends . i want to give up but i also feel obligated to up keep this persona of being a good daughter friend girlfriend,etc... and a big provider at home so i have not told anyone about it. someti ame i wi will let my bf know that i am feeling down and i do not feel like talking as much long thistance , but in reality i do not want to scare hi am away, especially when it comes to seeking validation from hi am or really anyone in my life. even at work i would rather work ti will i am extremely exhausted than rather ask a day off or take a break for lunch. how do you deal with this? how do you remind yourself that you re worth more than what you perceive yourself to be? should i be afraid to tell my family and everyone around me i have relapsed in a sense?	moderate
 th breakdown for the month hey, i do not want to make this too long but here it goes. so i have had depression before for a very large part of my life. i just got free off of it last year and largely due to my current friends who really pulled me out of that sadness and anxiety and pointless feeing. but now i am so scared again of loneliness repeating because next year we graduate. before we graduate me and my best friends are all going on exchange for months. so we have now from march to june. months. then summer and exchange for months. then we come back for another months and we are done. i am just so happy with them and we are all so close that we reassured each other that we would never ever leave each other but i love having them around and idk what happens after all this is over? graduation. exchange. all of it. i am just going back in that pointless state of mind where i think nothing matters and that i should just put a stop to it when it is sti will amazing. but i know that would hurt everyone so much and it would be so selfish of me. idk. i just needed to pour this all out here	moderate

am i depressed or do i actually have depression please help hi there fellow reddit users as i am thinking about this post i am about to explain to you i realize i do not even really know where to start to be honest but i wi will try my best to make this easy for you guys to read. i am a year old high school student boy living in america, east coast to be specific but that does not matter, i lately think that i have depression or i think i am just depressed but i dont really know because my whole life i have been the type of kid to not be the popular kid but i am also not the nerd geek type of kid. i am i guess a stoner student you could call me because i am an avid weed smoker and i have done a good amount of different drugs considering i am i know its young but that kinda my whole point i only really smoke weed on a constant basis tho. i am also smart in a couple ways like how i go on reddit and other computer things like going on the deep web and knowing bitcoin currency and ordering drugs from there and building computers. so, i dont know if i am depressed because i have many of friends in and out of school and i am social and i do not seem very sad at school and when not at home but once i get home and i am by myself my brain kinda of switches in a way of thinking i guess you could say because i get sad for no reason at home and i just think of ki willing myself because i start to think of how my mother is not proud of me because my grades and complete shit and she hates the fact i do drugs and my father is not in the picture and has not been in the picture since i was about . like today probably minutes ago in the shower out of nowhere i just thought about what it would be like to ki will myself and make a suicide note. i focused this thought mainly on the suicide note tho and just what i would say in the note to be exact and that thought is what made me actually come on here and make this post. i know that my mother loves me and my family loves me so that is not my reason of being sad. i am also not a fucking i ammature kid and i play computer games and i find myself to be quiet mature for my age to be honest. it is all hard to explain and i did not do a great job of doing it but i did my best and let me know if you guys know what the hell is wrong with me and if i should get help. thanks and goodbye.	moderate
how to deal when you break stuff? i recently had all my things together, i have been working and studying and everything was flowing nice and smooth, i finally had money to buy a new phone, after years of dealing with a shitty phone that worked only for basic stuff i had finally had a good smartphone, i bought this phone last week, it was perfect, good sound, good camera, good performance, everything you would expect of a good phone, and just today it fell from my kitchen table and the screen cracked, i am devastated, the phone i worked hard to pay just... broke, like that, it hit me so hard, i looked at replacement screens and they are around dollars usd, this phone was dollars usd, i just fucked it up, i did not go to work and i did not go to school today, i suddenly feel like a failure, i have been in my room without doing nothing more than looking at my cracked screen and crying, i do not feel like anything wi will cheer me up. idk what to do now, i can continue my life and just buy a new screen but that is like a month or two of saving just for a god damn screen, what is even the point, now i do not have the punctuality bonus and i do not have some works that i had to do in school today, i feel that i just entered a bottomless hole of failure. also, everyti ame i look at my phone to answer some messages or browse reddit i get reminded of my stupidness, i am now paranoid of using my computer, what if i also break my computer, what if i go to work tomorrow with a broken phone to everyone to see that i am stupid, what if i now also break my friendships that i have worked too hard to make because i am not paying enough attention, it feels like the end of the world, i do not even feel that there is anyone i can tell because they wi will just think that i am over reacting to little things, and what is worse is that my psychiatrist does not answer my messages since i was not able to go to a session because i slept through my alarms this monday, everything is just going downhi will, i do not know how to deal with this anymore.	moderate
is it possible to cure depression? or just treat the symptoms? i am not depressed of the ti ames, it tends to come in waves, but i have been experiencing symptoms of depression since i was a child. i can remember being under years old and having no motivation, and just wanting to stay in bed all day. even lying to my parents trying to tell them that i physically could not get up, just because i wanted to stay in bed all day. i am not a lazy person when i am not depressed, it is just depression drains everything out of me. someti ames my mood starts i amproving and i just feel happy for no reason. singing in the car, dancing just because, friendly, social, etc. but that is not the norm. how do i make this the norm? i have never been treated for depression or sought out any type of medical health. mental health is not something i ever talked about with my parents and i just do not know where to start. i am sick of feeling apathetic and even though i have everything i thought i wanted, i am just going through the motions. waking up in a bad mood every day for no reason. not wanting to talk to people, faking a smile all day, staying in bed until i have to get up for work, not making plans with friends, etc. help 	moderate

feeling completely replaced amp is causing so much pain? preface my depression is already at the worst it is ever been this past month. this then happens and it crippled me. we were so close, for years. he was the only person i trusted and was close to. last week we argued bc i got out of hospital and he m did not visit me, instead talking to local girl f . i confronted hi am and he deleted her and said he wouldn t even like her anyway because he does not respect her job online sex work . he cut me off a few days later, zero emotion.. i went to drop my stuff off at hi am and he looked at me like i was a stranger, he walked off part way through the thiscussion about it and never spoke to me again. to me it is unfinished conversation, to hi am it is forgotten. yes, he readded her, she blocked me, he blocked me, and he added the link to the same adult site she uses in his bio. ?? i am devastated. it is been days and i sleep about hours per night, cry excessively, and can barely eat a thing. i physically can not face another week feeling this horrendous. my thoughts have got dark. on waiting list for nhs therapy, doctors know how low i am but can not do much more than they are. i feel replaced and thrown away for new girl. painful to know he probably is super taken with, as she very sexual like hi am, and thanks to my serious health issues i have been too sick to be sexual in a while he is got his dream fantasy, and i have got my nightmare. feel not good enough and like the loser here. i am here inconsolable while they are probably having a great ti ame together, me not crossing his mind. i would not even get closure let alone a apology. just tell me how the hell to get over this. i can not physically be sad about it for another second. i am sick of crying. i am in a lot of pain.	moderate

i have got no aspiration, no interest in anything, no fun why do i feel like it takes so much effort to do anything in life. a little background about me i am a college student. i have been living a decent life with not much trouble in life. recently i figured out that i might be depressed. i have so much trouble making friends ever since a few years ago. when i meet someone for the first ti ame i try to look cheerful but it gets very tiring and i realized that i avoid gatherings because i find it pointless and tiring. at this point i am too scared to ask how to make friends nowadays. i hate social media because it makes me sad to see all other people having a blast of life in their lives. i have got no interest in life or have a hobby that i am geniunely interested in. i find this espiecially true with my college work. i deal well with doing things that i am told to but i feel like its a pain to do anything extra outside the coursework because i am just not interested so i do not feel like putting in effort in doing anything in life. i just want a decent job which pays me but who is going to hire a person like me right who has no interest or passion in whatever right? another problem i am facing is trying to focus on something. i just burnout on anything i do in life. i try to start something new but before i know it i either lose interet and give up. i dont know whether its a focus problem arising from lack of thiscipline by me or i am just depressed any my brain is not working. i do not know whether i am suffering from this lack in motivation because i am depressed or its just an attitude problem but i really need a way out because i am starting to lose hope in whatever i do and my future does not exactly seem bright with the way i am going. i know there are more serious cases or people with more pressing issues but it would be nice if someone can give me an genuine advice on solving the issues i am facing. thank you.	moderate

suicide popped into my head, because i am tired of dragging everyone down, while i am enduring an emotional void. for the past two days, i have felt numb for the most part, then more manic depressed than usual. i have had phases before, where i experience emotional stagnancy. i have lost motivation and pleasure to do everything. where as i had at least some amount of desire and drive, before two days ago. i do not want to feel like a hallow, emotional, stoic, shell. i do not want to feel detached and like i am not really in my body. i am worried this current state might extend for a long stretch of ti ame. i do not want to be a soulless burden who sucks the life out of everything. i feel like everyone would be better off without me, but i do not feel like i want to hurt myself. which is different for once. i just feel like i could sit, doing nothing, just being a sedentary rock for the rest of my life. and accept it.	moderate

depression is not something si ample to get rid of there is nothing i hate more than some asshole saying depression is no big deal. i have not been able to genuinely smile for so long because of depression. i lie that i am fine to the ones i care about just so they do not have to worry about me. depression is much more complicated than people who do not have it can comprehend.	moderate

a wall stands between me and getting closer to other people sorry if this is all over the place, i am on mobile and just needed a space to vent...my head is a mess my entire life i have always felt like there is this space between me and the people whom i associate with, within this space lies a wall that i can not seem to ever get through. my friends, my family, they all have people in their lives that they spend a lot ti ame with, whether it is a partner or a best friend, and i just never got to have that kind of close bond with anyone. last ti ame i had anything close to that was in highschool, and even that person thisappeared from my life as soon as we graduated. now even my first boyfriend makes me feel like he does not want to be around me that much by seeing me maybe once a month, and i know it is sti will early into our relationship but i fear that it wi will never get any better if it is starting like this. and i know people need their alone ti ame and space, i know life can be chaotic and unexpected, but this just reminds me of all the relationships ive had with the people in my life. every job i have ever worked i have always gotten along great with my peers, but it always felt like everybody had their clique and i was an outsider. every friend group i have ever found myself in made me feel like an outsider. now do not get me wrong, i have amazing people in my life who i sincerely appreciate, i just do not have a close bond with any of them. and having zero close bonds in my life just really makes me feel alone. and i am pretty much alone of the ti ame so that does not help i know i have struggled with depression and anxiety throughout life, so i try to keep in mind that my mental health does i ampact my perspective which can help someti ames, but it is a little more overwhelming lately than usual. i feel sad, i feel mad, and then someti ames i just feel so blank and detached from everything around me. thank you for taking the ti ame to read this if you got this far. i just really had to let this out somehow some way...	moderate

it is not senioritis senioritis happens when high school kids get accepted into college and stop caring about grades. my grades are falling in my last semester, but it is not senioritis. it is the fact that before college admissions happened i could pretend i was going to have some great life and leave high school and feeling like i was worthless all behind. but now the only schools i have applied to are easy admission schools in state while all my friends are going to the top schools in the country. and i am going nowhere with my life. it is that every day i realize i have less and less to look forward to in my future and that i can not keep pretending i wi will somehow figure out how to be normal or how to at least be legiti amately successful at one fucking thing. everyday i wonder what the point is, and now it is a good possibility that i may not graduate. and i someti ames do not care if graduate. i do not care if my grades drop. and the worst part is that no one else is going to notice, because they know it is just senioritis, right? it happens to everybody. there is nothing actually wrong, right? so i do not care enough to fix it and no one else does either.	moderate

my best friend does not like me anymore we used to be close, very close. he would look up to me when he needed guidance, i would come to hi am when i was alone. he was like a brother to me. we were always happy to see each other. but then something changed. i told hi am i was depressed he is the first person i ever told that i dealt with family abuse and abandonment. at first he pitied me, felt bad for me. but then every ti ame i tried to contact hi am for some advice or help he would ignore me. i do not know what happened but after that day everything changed. he was less excited to see me, we were awkward towards each other. keep in mind that this is all taking place in high school where were both yr old guys. i do not have that many friends and the ones i do, do not matter to me compared to hi am. but wait! there is more to this story... because of this i began to feel insecure, inadequate and started self deprecating. i began to push hi am away because that is what happens when you are depressed trapping my rage towards hi am inside my body, blocked hi am from sm and then i longed for hi am so i kept texting and adding hi am back. in the end he ask me why are you so strange? this literally broke me to pieces because he forgot that i was depressed. i feel that he does not care about me anymore and he just wants me to let go of hi am. i admit that i acted rather clingy towards hi am because he did not understand what i was going through, but i also think he is right, that i should let go of hi am and end our friendship. ugh. just thinking about this makes me sick to the core. thanks for reading, truly. any advice would be appreciated.	moderate

i am starting to feel like i am truly a lost cause. a small rundown of my life and a little bit of backstory this section does not need to be read to understand the situation i just thought it may be helpful honestly, i am not too sure how best to start this post off, i guess i should try my best to explain why i am making it. i have been dealing with depression since i was or so and have been dealing with anxiety pretty much all of my life. my anxiety started young as separation anxiety si ample things like being afraid of being away from my mother, i remember going to therapy at a young age and for the most part, this anxiety kinda thissolved over ti ame. i would say around the ti ame i started middle school i started to notice generalized anxiety, at the ti ame i did not think it was a big deal and i did not feel the need to tell anyone. when high school came around that anxiety got a lot worse and i had started to feel like there was no point in doing things. i would consider this to be the closest thing to a starting point for my depression as i lost interest in things and slowly stopped caring about my grades or my future. it was bad enough that grades were slowly dropping but i started to feel more and more depressed and hopeless. fast forward to the beginning of my second year in high school and i was pretty much feeling the same way only a lot worse, i frequently had thoughts of suicide and there were multiple points where i thought of how i would go through with it. a friend that i had met online at the ti ame convinced me into going to see my school counselor, it was very difficult and i was scared of people finding out what i was going through. my counselor eventually talked me into getting my mom involved and i started seeing a therapist, within a fairly short amount of ti ame i was diagnosed with a general anxiety thisorder and major depressive thisorder clinical depression . i was put on prozac a short ti ame after and would remain on it for a little over a year, my dose was increased multiple ti ames until i was at the maxi amum safe dosage that i could be on. i never felt any significan not change while taking the medication and eventually i stopped seeing my therapist. my current situation the reason for me making this post is because i almost feel like i am out of options. i am currently so i have been trying to find some relief for my depression and anxiety for years now. i have tried multiple medications prozac, zoloft, pristiq, and more recently paxil . none of the medications that i just mentioned have done anything at all for me and my doctor recently put me on bupropion mg xl which i have been taking for about days now. these past or days have been really rough and i have felt my mood get a lot worse, i was told that this medication would give me energy which i have been lacking for the longest ti ame but the opposite is taking place. almost every day since i have been taking the medication i have felt exhausted someti ames as early as or pm, i have felt more emotionally sensitive than usual and have been really irritable, my mind has felt clouded and most of the ti ame it is hard to think. noticing these side effects i decided to look into it online and it seems that it is not too uncommon for people to feel these effects on the medication and people say that the medication worked for them even though they started with si amilar side effects and to stick through the first few weeks. at this point, i am really hoping that something comes out of dealing with these side effects but honestly, i wouldn t be surprised if yet another medication does nothing for me. i am starting to wonder if i have treatment resistant depression and after looking into that i am feeling even more hopeless and stressed out. if any of you have any advice especially if you have taken bupropion i would be really thankful as i am starting to feel like this is my reality and wi will never be i amproved. as a side note, i wanted to mention that i do apologize if my post is too long or hard to understand it kind of turned into a bit of a rant and telling these details is sti will fairly difficult for me.	moderate

undiagnosed and do not know what to do f high school student. i started this year with a good attitude and good grades. now i can barely speak to any of my friends without thinking that they are forcing a friendship with me for the sake of it, i can not focus in class, my marks are dropping significan notly, and i can not help but cry every night. i have booked a psychiatrist session at a local hospital, but their waiting list is about weeks. i do not know if i can honestly wait that long before i start to hurt myself. i have never tried diagnosing or self diagnosing, as i always saw it as an exaggeration, i just assume that it is stress that is getting to me all the ti ame. i do not know if i am depressed or not, but i want to seek professional help somehow. i was once happy and cheery, but suddenly everything is gone wrong and i do not know why. i get constant mood swings i can be fine for a few hours, but then i am hit with a wave of emotions randomly , i have been on my menstrual cycle for probably a week longer than normal, eating meals everyday, getting more tired and fatigued than usual wanting ti ame sleep more and getting constant headaches too. i do not know what an anxiety panic attack feels like, so i just think i am stressed and unhappy no clear diagnosis. i do not know how to approach my school with this either do i tell them i am sad? i do not have a doctors note or anything, i just feel empty and weak. if there are any methods of at home treatments or medications please let me know, i am borderline desperate.	moderate

on vacation on a ship in the caribbean with my family. i want to die. i am writing this sitting in the smoking area, while drunk people happily dance a few feet away to a live band. i have experienced things this past week that i didnt think i ever would. my kids are having the ti ame of their lives. i should be happy. depression. a word that i have struggled with for most of my life. i do not suffer from that. i am not crazy. i have never been able to admit to myself that i suffer from mental i willness. until now. i am pushing . i am married with two beautiful children. i have an okay job that i have been at for years and i am a homeowner. i should be happy. i struggle with anger. the smallest things set me off. driving brings out rage. something does not go right. rage. things get thrown, my basement walls have the battle scars of my fists. after every explosion, i come back to earth with feelings of shame and remorse. there is no physical abuse in my house, but my kids are afraid of me. growing up, dad was a drunk. a mean drunk. not so much physically abusive, but when he was drunk, he would spit his venom at my mom, sister and i. he ended up losing his job for drinking and my parents split. from the ti ame i was my mom would work up to three jobs at a ti ame. i spent a lot of ti ame alone when i was a teenager. my sister was much older and moved out at . i didnt have too many friends through high school and was, more or less, a loser. i learned to cook for myself at a young age and was alone while mom was at work in the afternoons and nights. i was molested by an older boy when i was or . i can not remember most of the details, but i know it happened. more than once. self loathing. i hate myself. i mean, i fucking hate myself. i have struggled with weight for most of my life. up and down. i have man boobs. i remember being made fun of as a child for it. i was with my wife for nearly two years before she saw me without a shirt on. we had a child before she saw me without a shirt on. i love swi amming. i can count on one hand the amount of ti ames i have swam since i was . i see myself in the mirror and i wish for death. constantly. i am thisgusted by my being. thoughts in my head you re garbage. you re a piece of shit. you re thisgusting. you re a fat waste of space. you get the idea. i have very high levels of stress and anxiety. all the ti ame. i am worried about everything and i mean everything. i have managed pretty well for most of my life. keeping things in check. keeping things together whilst being plagued by worry, anxiety, depression and anger. i rarely drink. as of late i have been using legal marijuana as a coping mechanism. i was really anxious about this trip that i am on. swi amming. fuck. this whole episode started at the beginning of january when i started thinking about this trip. i hit rock bottom with depression and suicidal ideation. i didnt talk to anyone in my family for days. i even started making exit plans. one of my family members helped me along and i was starting to feel better. i even went to my doctor and had a couple meetings with the office counselor. this was extremely hard for me to do me i am a thisgusting man and i hate myself counselor i know lots of people that are unhappy with their bodies. well shit. that fixes everything. these meetings were a colossal waste of ti ame. since january i have had good and bad days. the bad outnumbering the good by a large margin. i have never in my life felt so out of control as i have these past couple of months. i feel like everything is unravelling. my wife. i can not talk to her. it feels like she does not want to hear it. she does not want to listen. she is emotionally thistant. no hugs or kisses in my marriage. hugging her is awkward. yeah you read that right. hugging and kissing my fucking wife is awkward. she is amazing with our children, like a mom. myself, i feel like i have a roommate. i do not feel loved and it hurts so bad. i have tried talking to her about it many ti ames but nothing changes. i see other married couples holding hands, hugging and kissing and it rips me to shreds. i have never been medicated. i have never been properly diagnosed. and i have never really talked about it. as i mentioned earlier, i have been pretty good at holding things together. i just can not do it anymore. standing on the deck, i look down into the black waters and picture myself jumping in to my death. just cli amb over the railing and after a few minutes, i wi will be like sonic the hedgehog in the water levels. falling into the abyss. sitting in the room, i think about tying my belt around my neck and closing it in the top of the bathroom door. i have not attempted suicide before but that does not stop me from thinking about it all the ti ame. almost anything i see, i think about how i can use it to ki will myself. i am terrified of these dark thoughts. my oldest child knows that something is not right. he is overheard conversations i have had with my wife and he is been really upset. its reminding me about how i felt when i was his age. i feel powerless to stop it. i get so down on myself and say horrible things about myself and i see how it hurts hi am and its ki willing me to see hi am cry. i love hi am so much and i am breaking hi am and i want to die even more when i think about it. i think my kids are the only reason i am sti will here certainly is not my wife . i am tired. i am tired of the pain.i do not know how much longer i can keep it together. i am so fucked up. i am on an amazing vacation. i have experienced amazing things in the past week. i should not feel this way. i am so tired.... tldr i hate myself and want to die. i am sorry this post was so long, i just needed to vent.	moderate

my rant long post i f need to rant a bit because i can not really say the things i am about to say to anyone else in my life. lol go back years ago from today and everything was mostly fine. i had great friends, a loving partner, and a family that i thought truly cared for me. in march of , my boyfriend and i broke up due to trust issues. a month later, one of my friends moves far away due to issues in her family. i have not heard from her since. in may of , all hell broke loose. my friends started to fight and argue with each other constantly, and i was basically the bridge between them. my family started to turn against me, yelling at me for not doing anything useful with myself. my anxiety shot through the roof and i started getting sick extreme weight loss, hair loss, fatigue, etc. . i think this might have been the cause. i just know that nothing was the same after that month. weak ties with my family members. two friends out of my life. eventually, my ex boyfriend and i had a talk, and we ended our connection on a good note.. but he and his family moved out of the city, and we never talked again. meanwhile, my remaining friends are sti will fighting. that shit builds up emotionally. skip to november of . i started dating one of my close friends who was unfortunately one of the main sources of drama at the ti ame. he convinced me to cut ties with my female best friend, who may or may not have only kept me around for her benefit. i did not want to do it, but i could barely even think clearly.. i was physically and mentally sick from my constant anxiety. i had broken most of my social connections in just one year and i felt like a piece of shit every day. fortunately, i am doing a lot better now. i am no longer physically sick, and i am rarely anxious anymore. but damn, i sti will feel horrible at the end of each day. here are some reasons why i think i might be bipolar i am angry for days, then an emotional high for days, repeated my family hates my boyfriend and they do not want me talking to hi am because they do not trust hi am at all we re also long thistance atm i am angry over almost everything i am lonely i hate myself and i do not have a job or ski wills if i tell my family anything like this, they fucking mock me i have tried, believe me i do not really like complaining but i just can not hold back anymore. if this keeps going on i wi will just ki will myself in the end. i have so much and yet i sti will hate life. i could ki will myself now and nobody would notice until hours after. but i am a coward, so.. lol	moderate
i can not trust in nobody, even if that person it is me. i am feeling always alone and miserable. the only person in my family, my sister, i have trusted in her, she just played with my trust and feelings. but, i know it is my fault because, i trusted in her and that was my fucking mistake. but i said ok, i have my friends. the only really two friends i have, are my cyber friends but they long ago do not connect and i am feeling hopeless and without love. weeks ago, a cute and gorgeous girl said me i am her crush and i was feeling so happy, i was feeling with hope. but yea, that shit it is over, she said me a week ago she not feeling prepared for a relationship and that it is okay, now we are friends but that really hurt me. i can understand sti will, but the pain was horrible, i am feeling i am a fucking boring person. i want friends but just i do not know i can not, someti ames some people said me i am a good person but not a good friend, lol. thank you.	moderate

it is so difficult i really do not know what to say, i got everything a good family, a roof on top of my head, i am healthy, but it seems like in my head i am falling apart. my mood switches from i want to end it to all happy and fine. i have a small circle but it is hard to do good when i am surrounded by negative energy. all my friends well most of them are either getting drunk or high messing with females dropping out of high school and i just feel lonely. i do not have instagram, facebook, twitter, i am truly alone in my mind. my mind wi will forever be my worst enemy. i have a low self esteem even though i get compli aments from females. it is just hard i do not know what to say. when i was young i never thought i would be like this always comparing my self to others or having mental breakdowns and i do not know who to go to. i can not go to my friends cause they wi will think less of me and judge me, i can not go to my family because they wi will think i am crazy, you might say i need a psychiatrist but i do not want to because people wi will find out. anyways thanks for reading 	moderate

a reminder that no matter how awful things seem, there wi will always be something that makes you happy i have been feeling really hopeless recently, and i did not even have enough energy to want to die. i just sat where i was and repeated i can not do this for minutes straight. when i opened my eyes, i saw a shirt on my floor that my dad gave me last year, that he wore for almost decades and consequently was very comfortable to have on. seeing his shirt brought the thought that, no matter how bad i get, and no matter what mood my dad is in, he is sti will going to love me. it did not i ammediately cure my depression and make me start dancing around my house, but it definitely helped to counter that utterly hopeless feeling. i wore that shirt when i went to sleep that night, and for the first ti ame in a while, i was able to keep it together while i fell asleep. i know a lot of you have probably felt si amilar to me before, and i know how stupid it feels to have someone tell you to just think positive! when all you want to do is quietly fade away into nothing, but please, next ti ame you feel like you have hit rock bottom, or even when you have not and you just are not feeling too good, find one thing, any one thing, no matter how small or seemingly meaningless it is, that makes you happy. i am not asking you to write a page, bullet noted thissertation on the meaning of happiness and how to strive for it, i am just asking you to find one small thing that makes you laugh, smile, blow air out your nose, or even just feel slightly less depressed. if you can not do it for yourself, do it for me. all the love, ultra	moderate
just want to vent a little. i feel my life is just over... like i have nothing to look forward to anymore, like if i would die tomorrow or in years the biggest difference would be the year and date. before i had the dream about having a nice home and someone to share it with, but i have come to realize that i might have to accept that it would not be like that. it hurts and makes everything else just pointless. i have been trying to get professional help but have only had one meeting and the next meeting is a few weeks away and i just want to stop feeling so damn useless and i do not know how much more i can take... all i want now is a reason... a goddamn reason as to why i should keep going when everything feels stacked so heavily against me. that is all i ask for.	moderate

how can i help? preemptive sorry for long post about years ago in my sophomore year of high school, i got really close to a group of friends that i am sti will actively in contact with even though most of us went to different colleges. we talked about everything childhood traumas, bullies, kinks, period ti aming some of the things i did not need to know about... . almost anything you can think of, we have opened up enough to talk about it to each other. i was normally the person who people came to for comfort whenever something happened, be it a breakup or a fight with a parent. i was really honored because i always thought that i could handle almost any situation that came to me because i thought i could be a neutral voice of reason that could calm them down. well recently within the past couple months , one of my friends, lets name her dee, was not doing amazingly well mentally and since i was in high school at the ti ame, i was perfectly wi willing to volunteer most of my free ti ame to help her because high school was not too much of a problem for me. whenever we talked she would hint at things like how her parents treated her and how life just was not worth living for her. i chose, at the ti ame, to not delve too deep into her past way before i met her and i was waiting for her to open up and tell me what was wrong by herself without me prying the information from her. a few months go by and she calls me to notify me that she has a new girlfriend that she wants to introduce to me. i think it is just splendid that she found someone that she likes and went to meet them right away after i was invited over for a weekend. the girl was very sweet and i had no problems with her dating my daughter dee. i left them feeling that this was a good sign! that this was going to be a potential for her to finally open up to someone new and get past some of her past traumas. sadly i was mistaken as almost a week later i get a skype call and get greeted by the face of a bawling dee, talking hysterically about how much she wanted to ki will herself and how much she hated being alive. a whole hour and a half later of minecraft this is the choice game of our friend group and calm music i was able to calm her down. following that, after calming down enough to talk, the conversation went something like this i do not have the actual conversation because it was during a skype call me so what is wrong? did something happen to you? did your girlfriend do say something? dee no, she did not do anything. i just do not know anymore. me so what triggered this? what happened to cause you to cry like this? dee i do not know. and that was the end of the conversation on that before she went to divert the subject to something else. in the past, i have picked up that from her past she has had multiple ti ames where she was sexually assaulted by her father and i have personally been at her house when her family were yelling at her, calling her many names that were extremely inappropriate. could the girlfriend situation have reignited that trauma in her mind? this whole situation was new to me as i was never used to seeing this reaction to nothing before. my question is what can i do to help someone who does not seem to know what is wrong, or does not want to tell me what is wrong? i have pushed her into finally getting a councilor after almost months of pushing her. should i have taken a step back and let her function on her own? almost everyday now she just says she feels like crying, or something along the lines of i do not want to go to school anymore . it really pains me to see her like this and i just do not know what to do to help her feel better. tl dr friend has a breakdown and i do not know what to do to help them in their ti ame of need.	moderate

how can i help a friend hi all, i have been following this sub for a while now on and off but i am here now because i am looking for help for a friend. my friend has been making regular thisplays of depression behavior for some ti ame now and i am concerned for his well being. i am a state away from hi am at school, and he has been at home alone for some months now with no real friend base. he pursued community college for a short ti ame and then dropped out. he does not have a job and most days does not leave his bed house except for occasional workouts and meals. i keep in touch with hi am daily but he is not entirely very open about the goings of his personal and daily life aside from some rare updates. i want to be able to support and encourage hi am but i am not sure how to do so without possibly insulting hi am or reminding hi am of his situation. how can i help hi am? how can i make his day aside from the contact i maintain with hi am now? i go through the same periods of social withdrawal and anxiety which he does and i know that such points truly are lows in life. any help is appreciated.	moderate
is life futile? hello friends... i have been having trouble sleeping the past few days. i often think about the meaning of life, but recently ive been going into overdrive thinking about it is futility. i can not sleep, it is bothering me. life is bad enough for me as it is. i have no friends, no job, and i am attending school, but failing my classes. i just see no point in making progress if all that is left in the end is death and no one to remember you. even if i did manage to pass my classes and get a degree, there would sti will be suffering. life would get so monotonous... wake up, drive to work in shitty traffic, work to hours, drive back in even shittier traffic, eat, sleep, and repeat. is that all life has to offer? i know i am being too general about it, and that life does have its ups. but... those small nuggets of happiness can not negate the mass shitshow life really is... am i wrong? should i just keep playing pretend for my own sanity? please convince me otherwise... i would like to find joy, but i find it difficult in this day and age...	moderate

 a poem by someone bad at titles lost, trapped and tangled in saran wrap been so long, i can never have myself back chest tight from the lack of air, that is what i knew but it is really the anxiety that leads nowhere, and that is the truth grasping at strands of wasted youth. where i stand is just where i am and not where i wi will be, i wi will decide that for me or so i thought to be indecisiveness is a thisease and running rampant through me future more uncertain than my brain when asked a or b? suicide seemed like a certainty then there was one friend gone, two friends gone, then suddenly three tears and nights and somber questions to the ether i didnt know the sun shined, i always thought there would be worse weather stuck in a constant state of being pressed, never to leave and only allowed stress, but how long can that last before you break, all it took for them was one mistake. open caskets and different faces, why do you have to be trapped in my head of all places. i want freedom i want to run but the shackles weigh me down, this was never fun why did i treat it like it was funny, i ammaturity like a stalked bunny? dumb blindness of an old dog, now i slink soundlessly to the back of the fog.	moderate
just venting because i have no one to talk to i feel like i have been dealing with depression for a while but i did not really notice it at first, at first i just thought i was sad and did not think much of it. i stopped being sad after a couple months and i thought i was fine and then it hit me again. i was sad and i stopped eating well, i barely ate one meal a day for a while but then i got better again for a little bit. and now i am back again, feeling the same way. i feel like i am doing this to myself, i am making myself worse but i do not care enough to allow myself to get better. i am really close to someone but i do not even feel like talking to them about this because they are just going to tell me to get help but i do not care enough to get help. i just want everything to stop, i want to just sleep forever. my dreams seem better than real life. i do not want to get better i just want it to end.	moderate

yikes this is long and boring hi. how is it going, everyone? i have been confused as to how to feel for a long ti ame now. i do not quite know whats wrong with me, if anything. for a while now, i have had an underlying feeling that something was wrong, but i have never been able to put my finger on it. i am a year old sophomore, attending a midwest private high school. to most, it would seem i have everything i could ever want at my fingertips a car which i did not have to pay for , a loving mom, a dad i can see on the weekends, and a significan not other that seems to genuinely enjoy my company. i have a small friend circle, but not too small. i suspect that i am suffering from depression, but i am not certain. this makes it hard to talk to others about everything as i am afraid that anyone i talk to regarding it is going to mock me, and belittle me for being over dramatic. it is for that reason that i have not requested a therapist psychiatrist, although i know that it would be beneficial. i guess i am just worried people are going to label me as just another fake depressed teen. i was diagnosed with adhd pri amarily inattentive about a year and a half ago, and have been lucky depending on how you look at it enough to receive medication for my thisorder. i have, and sti will do question my add diagnosis. when i was originally diagnosed with add my doctor recommended putting me on medication that was supposed to sharpen my focus and help my inattentiveness. i was put on dexmethylphenidate first, with little to no signs of i amprovement. i am not sure how long i took focalin dexmethylphenidate for, but it was not incredibly long. at our month check up i think..? i am not entirely sure, my memory of the past is basically nonexistent anymore. my doctor recommended that i try a different medication and see if i noticed i amprovement. we took her advise and she prescribed me adderall xr mg. when i heard this, i was excited. i started taking the medication and at first, noticed an i ammediate i amprovement. this i amprovement stayed as i took the medication for about a month to a month and a half. then, things started going downhi will. i noticed the medication was not helping quite as much as it had been in the beginning, and it was quite saddening for me. i learned how to take the capsules apart and turn them into an instant release version, essentially doubling the potency. i did this a few ti ames, but eventually stopped as i was too bothered to do it anymore. i do not even know how long ago that was, its as if my brain can not force itself to see that far into the past. regardless of that, i had my adderall dosage upped within the past two months, including a new instant release add on for the afternoon, which sti will does not seem to help all that much. i sti will have trouble finding the motivation to complete and turn in school assignments, as i did in the past. i do not know what causes this, but i feel like i have a clue hence why i am posting in this sub . half way through november of , i crashed my car. i was leaving school on my way home, and the roads were icy. i was taking a very sharp corner far too fast for the conditions, even though it was only about mph sliding directly into a guardrail. i was not wearing a seat belt, but that was not a concern. i put my little nissan sentra in reverse and backed out of the ditch. thankfully, nobody witnessed the fuck up. i pulled off to the side of the road and inspected the damage. i smashed my right headlight, put a large dent in my hood, scraped up the bumper, and busted the gri will. there was no structural damage, and the repair costs weren t astronomical, but after that day i developed a fear for that bend in the road. every ti ame i went past the corner i could not help but replay the memory in my mind, and i sti will can not to an extent, months later. i am including this event in my post as i believe it was the major tipping point for my anxiety. prior to this incident i had dealt with very little perceived anxiety, and was normally very easygoing. it was as if something changed in my brain. like a light switch, waiting to be flipped. about months ago, i took up frequent marijuana use. i never really smoked huge amounts of weed, but i smoked at every opportunity. i considered it my medication. it calmed me down, and made the once lonely and boring nights seem bearable. two weeks in, i wanted nothing but to smoke weed and chi will. i stopped picking my girlfriend up from school occasionally as she goes to a different school than i do and fell into a bad place. i was coming to school high, and my friends could tell. they noticed i was more social and seemed happy in the first few hours of the day, but they also noticed the zombie like me that stumbled around the hallways and looked visibly sad during the latter half of the day. i would drive home after school everyday and smoke a bowl first thing just to make life more bearable. i got to the point where i told myself i would rather die than stay sober for a week. do not get me wrong, weed can be fucking amazing. i love it. it is just about as safe as fucking advil, and it feels great, yes, i realize it is not good for the maturing teen prefrontal cortex. but i recognized i was forming a very bad habit mental health wise. when i was sober i craved more, and lost what little motivation i had before. weeks into my habit, i began facing some difficulties in my relationship. my significan not other was and sti will is extremely against marijuana. i find it repulsive that she can not be open minded to the idea of it, but its whatever. anyway. while i was high, i found it incredibly easy to show affection to her, and it made cuddling her favorite activity genuinely amazing. this was all great, but the problems came when i was sober. i was increasingly apathetic when i was sober, more so than ever before. it was almost like i could not feel any emotions anymore. i hated it. so i did what any rational person would have done, and smoked more weed! i was spending upwards of dollars a week on high quality bud from my dealer. not only was i spending more money, i was spending less ti ame with my girlfriend. as ti ame went on, i was spending like days a week with her versus our normal days a week together. it may have made me a little sad that i was not spending as much ti ame with her, but i was alright, i was too high to care! but then, i was not. about two weeks later, my dad decided he needed the spare gri will for some truck he owned. i have no clue why, maybe he was just looking for some excuse to poke around in my trunk, because he did. i guess i had left my car unlocked, which was my first mistake. he opened the trunk via the switch inside the car and i assume was greeted with the pungent smell of burnt weed and dirty pipe. he laid my stash out on the gri will of my car and called me outside to look at all of my weed and weed paraphernalia. something had told me it was not going to be a good day as soon as i woke up that day, and man was that something right. i told the truth about it all, such as how i was self medicating with it. my dad, being an alcoholic, was not able to punish me severely without being a hypocrite. he did take my brand new glass pipe i had bought literally a day before, about gs of trash weed i got with the pipe, and my lighters though, which was the worst punishment of them all. i also lost my car for like weeks other than to and from school. my doctor prescribed me clonidine, an off label sleep medication. i sleep alright now i guess, but nights are sti will difficult. i can not hardly get out of bed anymore, generally i have to take my adderall to even get up. i do not think that is normal. as of recently i have been researching designer benzos such as etizolam and clonazolam trying to find something that i can use in place of weed. i feel as if i need marijuana or some si amilar substance to correct my bland life. i only ever find intense pleasure and a sense of well being when i am at least a little high. i feel like i have fallen into a depressive stupor, and i have not been able to claw my way out for weeks. i have been exhibiting depressive tendencies, and i do not know what to do. we re all depressed. everyone is, in my opinion. its obvious to me, everyone is depressed, so whats the point in talking about it? its not like anything is going to get better, if anything its only getting worse. i hate to think like this, but i am afraid its the only way to make things bearable. i try my best not to think a good majority of the ti ame, just so i do not encounter these troublesome thoughts. hopefully things do get better.. i wi will be waiting for when they do. maybe this is all just part of growing up, hormones or something. if so, damn, i wish i did not have to grow up. thanks to anyone who gave the ti ame to read this, it took me over two hours to type this up.. sorry !	moderate

read this i think it wi will help!!!! ok so this wi will probably be long but it is worth reading. i am a young highschool student and my life is hell right now, i am failing online school, friendships, and overall just life. i usually spend ever day in my bed just laying there. i have not left my house and months and i feel like i am just dead. but tonight something happened. i am usually up every night do to insomnia. so i was staring at things in my room and saw my makeup and thought i would play with it. i have not done anything like this in forever. i was randomly playing with eyeshadow when i thought of doing a full face of makeup. so i did and then i thought i would put on an outfit for fun. i put one on which i have not done in months. i live in the same two outfits. so here is the interesting part.... keep in mind months ago i tried getting all dressed up to see how i would feel and it lead to hours of crying. but this ti ame i looked in the mirror and i saw myself. i was surprised i have not felt like i am myself for awhile. i felt absolutely beautiful. then it hit me i am alive, i am not dead i am a living person. and the past me before all the depression and anxiety hit, wouldn t want me to die. i can not slowly ki will myself. because i am alive. i started to cry happy tears and stared at myself. it was the same me i saw before i gave up. i did not think i would ever see this me agian. it was a bit trippy be a i did not feel like i was even looking at myself just a beautiful stranger in away... yet it was me. of course i only wore the outfit and makeup for minutes then took a shower. other wise i would of had an anxiety attack. but the point is i got up only if it was just for a second. and i think that you should try this. it may take a couple try is where you have a breakdown. but it could lead to you felling like you agian. i also want you to know that even if it is deep deep down there is a small piece of you or your past self that wants you to be alive. because slowly ki willing yourself is only going to make you feel worse. and ending it would not allow that piece of you to grow until your able to get back up. i know how hard life is but if we try it wi will be easier. i do not have bipolar depression but i have moments where i am bipolar. so someti ames i wi will feel like this and the hit rock bottom but i am now realizing that i have to cli amb up agian even if i keep falling. i need to keep cli ambing and so do you. i hope this helped just know i care for you and you deserve life!!!	moderate
how am i supposed to react to this? i started seriously talking to this friend at work just after thanksgiving. she was actually the first and only person i have ever told about my depression, and she was so nice and understanding about it that i started to feel something for her. it got to the point where we were somewhat seriously considering a relationship up until she quit her job a week ago and now she has not said anything to me since. she sti will talks to everyone else, but she does not want anything to do with me anymore. how am i supposed to feel? she actually seemed genuinely interested in me, talking about how she misses me when i am not there, i am the reason she goes to work, and that i helped her past the trust issues she got after her previous relationship ended. a co worker told me yesterday that she found a boyfriend, which i do not mind. i really just want to keep my best friend, but she is avoiding me without so much as a goodbye. what do i do? she told me she had trust issues and now she is given me them. how the hell am i supposed to trust anyone when the person i loved the most took my heart and stomped on it after everything we have been through? the last thing she told me was that i would never lose her as a friend, so was it all just some big fucking lie? i just want to curl up and die somewhere.	moderate

lost i by no means lived a positive life before i got to this point. but i went through trauma recently and can not handle the light it has shed on literally every aspect of my life. i have lost all of the momentum that i have been working a life ti ame to build. i have come to realize that i have been self medicating to make up for the lack of family i have gone without for so long. the only family support i have is a manipulative mom that i am now taking care of. that is really difficult to say. everything is raw. i do not know what to do with it all. yes i am on medication. yes i eat healthy most of the ti ame. yes i try to work out. yes i go to therapy twice a fucking week. yes i try to keep it all together. i can not even manage to live a normal person is life. even dressing myself is a hurricane of anxiety. i was in a car accident. i broke both of my legs. i went through a brutal recovery with a total of fractures. everything changed. someti ames i think it was the universes only chance at stopping me in my tracks. but today and many days leading up to this moment i am grieving all the things that i lost. i lost my health. i lost the friends that thisplayed their true character. losing your friends when you have no family is devastating. i lost my career which i have sacrificed everything for. i am now so far behind i honestly do not know if i can ever catch up. my career was my life. it was my way of proving my worth to myself, to fight depression. it thistracted me from the lack of family support that i have lived without my entire life in denial. i was protecting myself through thissociation for so long i do not know how to cope with this reality. i feel so alone. so now here it all is. all at once. and every day it seems to make less sense as i unpack it all. i just feel like such a mess despite all the efforts i am making. some days i am inspired by my changes but at the end of the day i feel like it is all a mask and i end up here, in this moment. i wonder how the hell i am going to put it all back together while i harbor this confusion, loss, frustration and grief. i am grieving the loss of my life and the denial that kept me safe. i am not sure what i even expect from this post thanks for listening reddit.	moderate

just a small chat. just need to get things off my chest. theres this one regret in my life that i really can not get over everyti ame i think about it feel like a complete monster and like i deserve the worst. like even just writing that out sounds like such a stupid reaction. i ended drinking and then accidentally taking my anti anxiety meds which can not be mixed with alcohol blacked out and apparently punched a cop. woke up in the drunk tank started down a complete spiral and was suicidal for months and sti will get there someti ames. i lost my closest friend in the process who i know see wasnt the greatest friend . everyti ame i think about her or the night and the ti ame after i end up hating myself again after all this hard progress i made. it is been just over a year and i do not know how to get over it. i have definitely basically cut alcohol out of my life, i never liked drinking anyways just did it because everyone else did. i moved back home after this incident but i need to move back for sept and i honestly dont know if i can deal being around the same areas. i dont want to hate myself forever i want to get over this.	moderate

self harm what would you want to hear? hey everyone, this is my first ti ame posting here. i thought maybe i could ask someone who knows how it feels, what would they want their friends to say do. i became friends with this girl a few months ago. we re in the same university but we weren t close prior to this academic year when another friend of mine introduced us. we got on really well since we have a lot in common and we see each other pretty much every day in uni. she is quite shy and does not share her feelings that often and even though she has never said explicitly that she is depressed i know she is. she is failed her last assignment not because she is not smart but because she just has not done enough work. if she fails another one there is a chance she would not pass this year. we were celebrating a friends birthday a few days ago and at one point she rolled up her sleeves a little bit and i saw the scars. i had no idea she self harmed before. for a second i was trying to decide whether i should say something or not but then i just grabbed her wrist and she asked me if i want to talk outside so we went. i could not tell if the scars were old so my i ammediate question was if she sti will does it and she said yes. she is told me she is been doing it since pri amary school and that she is tried to stop many ti ames but she always ends up doing it again. now, i know people self harm for different reasons so i asked her what was hers and she said it is kind of like a stress relief. she has also apologised a few ti ames that i had to see it . i have never been in that kind of situation before so i did not know how to approach it but this is what i said pretty much i asked her if anyone from her family knows and she said her mum does but not that she sti will does it. i told her there is no need to apologise and that this does not change how i feel about her and that i just want to see her get better. i asked her if she is seeing anyone because i know she used to but stopped a while ago and she said she is signed up for therapy and is going to her first session next month. lastly, i told her i am there for her is she needs to talk to someone. is there anything else i could have said done? or anything else i can do now with this information? regarding her grades, i know she has an extension so her tutors must know there is something that stops her from doing work. also, she is if anyone is wondering. any suggestions appreciated.	moderate

tired of feeling tired? life feels like drowning do you ever get that? i am suffering from sleepiness and it is affecting my full ti ame job and paralyzing my hobbies. it makes everything harder. my reactions to small inconvenience range from taking it in stride, to feeling hopeless and fiercly suicidal. there is also some other complications going on. recently, a coworker stole over a thousand euros by tricking me into showing them my mobile phone, and this event really made me tired of having to worry about who i can trust or not. my brother is taking big risks in what he calls his final gamble, which is trying to have a baby through ivf through some shady foreign agency while the coronavirus is running around, while having not nearly enough cash in hand for it. i do not want hi am to become broke and die. by die, you know what i mean. i have also been stuck back to living with my parents again, fi willed with shame and doubt on whether i can ever take care of myself. my parents agenda is for me to stay with them forever, so they always downplay how well i can take care of myself. i am too scared to live alone because i might actually die. but yet, theres so much going well for me super good job, loving friends, supportive family and i feel stupid for even feeling this way, and feeling like i am lazy because i am falling behind on my hobbies. i am also often told that i should be grateful and then i feel even worse. with all that being said, life really does feel like swi amming in an ocean. someti ames, the waves are calm and you swi am, you get somewhere. someti ames, the waves drag you down and you start drowning, and the more you drown the less you can struggle. someti ames, your friends save you, or you find a small island to rest on temporarily. i am tired of swi amming. thanks for listening, redditor.. we need support, we need catharsis, we need to be reassured..	moderate

overreacting? hey guys, i am a year old bus driver in a major city and for the past months my life has been taken over. i was assaulted last april on the job, guy spat on my face three ti ames and almost began punching me. you might be laughing as most people do by now on how i classified being spit on assault, but it really fucked me up. company denied therapy thru workers comp, therapist are expensive so iv had to resort to sucking it up. since april, there has not been a single day that i dont think about that night, i can sti will smell his saliva on my face months later. today i found out i am in trouble for attendance, i can not bring myself to get out of bed some days. really at this point i have no clue how to stay strong anymore, i just want these feelings to go away.	moderate

wi will they put me in the psychiatric facility ? i am going to try to set up an apt to speak with a psychiatrist about my depression and i am a little nervous as to whether or not they would try to put me in a facility if i told them how i have been feeling. ok so over the past year, i have isolated myself to the point where when i am with my friends, i feel like they are wondering why i am even there because i have not hung out with them in so long. i rarely eat, and wi will be lucky if i manage to get calories a day. i used to love working out, going days a week but i do not care anymore and have not been in months. i am an insomniac it is am as i am writing this and usually can not get out of bed until pm. also, i have been having passive suicidal thoughts for a few months, but these past few weeks i have decided if i did do it, it would be with pi wills, weed and zzzquil. do not know what kind of pi wills i sti will do not plan to do it but if i did, that is how it would be done. now i am just wondering, with all that info, would they force me into a mental facility? i doubt i wi will be this candid when they ask me but it is truly how i feel and want to know, preferably from someone who is been an in patient, if they would keep me. sorry if this was confusing to read, i kept going back and deleting and rewriting shit	moderate

i am utterly depressed i have wanted to post on this group for a while now but god i hate talking about my own issues. i am not happy and i have not been happy for years now. i am currently in college and everything around me is falling apart grades and mental health wise and i just feel like a waste of space. i have been depressed for years now but now it is rooting into my friendships and now i am emotionally unavailable with the habit of hurting the people i care about even my own family not wi willingly but it is sti will depressing. i have every opportunity for success but my own fear of confronting my struggle is creating this toxic avoidance of facing the music and idk how much longer i can do this. i always find myself feeling good for a few hours but deep down i have no happiness and i can barely give any sort of love or real care for anyone. i always hurt the people i love cause i can just barely give them emotion. nothing has helped me it feels not family, sex, i have not done any drugs but at this rate idek what to do anymore. people have it way worse than me and i try to use that as a means to be hopeful but fuck it is hard to bottle everything up and lie to people you love cause you re too stubborn to be open. so i thistance everyone and attempt to forget about it cause idk if i am even going to live out a long life. i am afraid to grow older and become the black sheep who had no reason to fail like i have. mental health is ki willing me and i have been brought to my knees multiple ti ames by it and i just have no idea what to do anymore. i do not know if i wi will ever be happy, have any meaningful relationships, or even be around as i enter the real world. i hate myself i stare life in the eyes with a blank face cause i do not know if i can fight anymore. it is like i am too used to being depressed and miserable at this point. no coping seems to work either so i am just stuck feeling depressed after everything i do. it is a constant cycle of pain and it pains me that i am being a thisappointment. now i just feel stupid but apparently a good way to get through it is to write down how you feel.	moderate

i promised myself i would ki will myself if i was sti will alone on my th birthday. i sti will am. i have no friends in real life to talk too, so this wi will be my farewell letter. i have been alone for my entire life. i never had a girlfriend. i took advice from both the internet and actual therapists, clothing, haircut, keeping fit, joining clubs based around activities that interest me, you know the dri will. i am not thisliked at all, people that have to sit next to me in school at work have no problem with me. but the moment agenda does not put us in the same room, people forget me, be it the people from school, clubs, work. i am just not interesting enough to make people wish to continue talking to me, be it as friends or anything else, to them i am just a secondary character in the background, and by now i agree with it. my th birthday was some ti ame ago, i am not even sure why i did not do it as i promised myself, self preservation instinct i guess. i promised to myself when i was that i would try what there is to try to get out of my loneliness, with as a ti ame li amit. i feel like i am the same lost kid that did not knew how to make friends, lagging so far behind on basic human ski wills that i am a manchild that can not really understand when adults talk about aspects of their lives. i know is supposed to be young. i was told at that i was young and sti will had ti ame, same as , same as . i never felt young. i feel like i have been trying to do something out of my youth for years and failing at it. i have no memories of outings with friends or destinations that made me wonder. i traveled a lot, went out to events that interested me, watched the stars in forgotten places with no lights around. i did all of this alone, and it was not worth it. i feel tired, not young, the same i felt at , and all the subsequent years. i gave it ti ame as i was advised you re young, you ll find someone friends . i gave it more than a decade, and after a while it just feels old. years sounds like the good ti ame li amit to me, a good point to look back upon your life and think about what has been done and what to do next and enough experience under the belt to know a bit better who you are, what you are and what you can do. having spent them alone, it is a fair conclusion that it is not going to change in the next decade or afterwards. at my best form and with the most positive attitude i had, i never managed get a meaningful relationship with someone, be it as friend or more. most people my age know better what they want in love, are married or divorced, have kids or are planning to do so, the usual. i am lagging behind, i do not know the first thing about relationships and i doubt that someone knowing what they are looking for is going to bother with the bumbling steps of a manchild. i grew up and missed a basic part of the human condition, and it has gone for long enough. living life lonely is not worth it. it was not a few years back, it is not now, the only difference is i feel i should have spared myself the torture of the previous years, when i sti will had hope. so i fi willed the void with anything i could find, work, writing a lot, reading, sports, whatever. but it just does not act as a crutch anymore. my social life is empty. i did most activities alone, and after a while of not being able to share it with anyone, it just hurts. my artistical life is empty. i wrote a lot and took courses since i was , but i barely got any better. my professional life is about the only thing i managed well, i build prosthesis orthesis for amputated thisabled people, it pays well and there is no shortage of work and at least it is useful. that is the one thing i managed. in years of life, i managed to have a good job. and that is it. enough is enough, i am calling it quits. i researched the methods and have been practising one that fits me. i do not want to suffer for another decade just for a slight chance of sharing a meaningful moment with someone. if i can wish you one thing be foolish, make some mistakes, does not need to be extreme stuff, just get out of your comfort zone to have some good or wacky memories to have something to tell about your life, lest you end like me and wonder what you have done in all these years.	moderate

harder and harder honestly i just need to vent. i have had depression for as long as i can remember. my depression at the moment is probably the worst it is ever been. i have lost kgs, i wake up hating myself every fucking day, i have no energy and no wi will to take care of myself. my suicidal thoughts occur numerous ti ames every hour, every single day. i can barely make it through a day at work and what is even worse is that i work in retail. i can not stand pretending to be this happy person so customers can be satisfied. i can barely even force a smile anymore. as soon as i am finished work i come home and drink... i have developed a real drinking problem over the past months. but honestly it is the only thing in the day that keeps me going. it is also the only thing that makes me feel even the slightest bit better and helps me to sleep. my parents have moved overseas and knowing they are not here for support is honestly destroying me. it is just not the same messaging them. i also do not want to worry my parents because they have been through tough ti ames with me, they know how bad it can get. now that they have moved i do not want to be a burden and for them to worry incessantly about me. i have pushed away so many other family members and friends because i just want to be alone and i can not pretend to be this person they want me to be. no one but my parents understand. i just feel like i am drowning or suffocating and watching the world go on while i am stuck at square one for what feels like eternity. i am gasping for air and waving my arms for no one to see me and understand exactly how i am feeling. i do not want to fucking be here anymore. the only reason i am sti will here is because i could not bare the thought of putting my parents through the ordeal of grieving over my death. especially after all they have done for me. it seriously gets harder and harder everyday and i am slowly losing my grip on what feeing anything else is. i can not fake pretending everything is okay anymore. i am just a shell of someone i used to know. i do not even recognise myself anymore. i look in the mirror and see a stranger. i know, long post but i just needed to get my feelings out there. if you have read this far, thanks for your patience. i just have so much inside and i can not keep bottling it up. i know people here would truly understand how i feel.	moderate

had surgery that left me worse off. now i am depressed, scared, and in constant pain. i injured my wrist rock cli ambing. it was serious enough that the doctors suggested surgery and i went for it. it was pretty bad but i wish i did not do it. the surgery and recovery were really rough and the whole process took several months. but the pain never went away. in fact, it is worse than before the surgery. i told the doctor this and she was surprised and concerned and she said we can give it more ti ame but after a few more months, we can start to seriously talk about next steps which she said would be pretty unpleasant . this surgery was unpleasant enough. it was horrible. and now i do not know if those next steps would bring me back to normal or just leave me with a shitty wrist that just does not hurt. the main problem is that i need to be able to rock cli amb. i have been cli ambing for years and it is the thing in my life that brings me the most joy. i have not been able to cli amb in so long because of this and i am terrified that i wi will never be able to cli amb like i could only a year ago. and i am young! i just turned ! i am not ready for my body to start breaking in a permanent way. it feels like my life is over and i have been in a very dark place.	moderate

it felt like i was going to die. so this is a story about how i felt like my life was in a kind of danger i have not ever felt before. because of this event i am probably going to actively do my best to seek out professional help because i really do not want to die. last night.. well no, these past few days i have made some really poor decisions. i do not really understand what is going on with me but i think i am not only severely depressed but fighting with anxiety and stress on levels that are seriously effecting my health and i am terrified. last night i tried smoking some weed thinking it would help change my mood or something. to try and make me feel anything else really than my general uninterest in things or severe loneliness. to be completely honest with you, if you were to tell me i might have a drug problem or maybe a history of substance abuse you d be about half right. i do not really do drugs as often as i used to. when i was in high school i remember a ti ame where i smoked like maybe joints a day and bought ounces every other few days or so. these days i smoke maybe about . grams a month if even that. someti ames i go entire months without smoking even once. a lot of it is because i can not spare the funds to do it and i never really felt like it was something i depended on. back in high school i was extremely stressed out and did it recreationally a little too much but nowadays i lack the friends to even do it with and every ti ame i do it is by myself at night. the reason i am telling you this is because this serves more as a preface to the story of what happened to me these past couple of days. i have never in my life felt more scared for my life than what happened the last two ti ames i smoked.. so here it goes. the night i almost died it was a night like any other. i was feeling down and lonely and the usual really. i decided i was going to smoke a very insignifican not amount, like maybe pulls and clip the blunt because i did not want to get too high. after i finished doing so i started working on my pc because i was trying to install mac on a vm because i needed to use the os for something in relation to my iphones jailbreak. i started finding myself unable to focus on what i was doing even though i was reading the instructions out in my head and even out loud at some point because i noticed a second set of thoughts racing through my head that made it really hard to focus. and then it happened. suddenly this intense and spontaneous rush of negative thoughts completely overwhelmed my brain. i felt like i was being overloaded and began experiencing a rapid change in my heart rate as well as beat skipping and even pulsating physical pains as my heart continued to accelerate. i felt a rush of adrenaline as thoughts like i amagine if you died. or you should just ki will yourself began to rapidly fi will my head. i started feeling a shortness of breath, in fact i felt like any deep breath i would tried to take would lead to my heart exploding. i literally felt like at any second i was going to have a heart attack. i constantly held my hand to my chest and someti ames stood there in shock because i thought it happened, i thought my heart stopped or something or was going to. my first instinct was to try my best to calm down and drown out the negativity. i began talking to myself out loud trying to tell myself things like reasons i should live and that is not actually how i feel and i should relax. i told myself things like i have a family, and a loving mother who would be really sad if i were gone. i tried everything i could to help myself realize that these negative thoughts fi willing my head were not how i truly felt. someti ames it worked. i began to breathe slowly and my heart rate would slow and it temporarily subsided. i then sat down and tried continuing to work to thistract myself from the experience but eventually it just came back and even worse. i literally jumped out of my seat holding back the urge to scream or run out of my room and tell someone i feel like i am dying. my heart was beating so fast it scared me to try and even feel it because i felt like even a mere touch to my chest was going to stop my heart. things began getting really weird. i felt like i was possessed. for some reason i just started envisioning ways to ki will myself, like a scene playing in my head of me literally walking to the kitchen and grabbing a knife and doing who knows what with it. at one point i am pretty sure i heard whispers or something. my mind was just playing tricks with me and i felt like i was arguing with another version of myself. it got to a point where i had to text or call someone. i ended up texting my brother in law in an attempt to calm myself down by letting hi am know how i have been generally feeling. i did not want to tell hi am the exact situation i was in because i do not want to worry anyone as i sti will felt strong enough to overcome the situation because only a few nights before, the same thing happened. after texting with hi am for a bit i began to calm down more and i also downloaded an app on my phone to help monitor my heart rate and try more breathing exercises to calm down. after i was finally over the high i started realizing that my heart rate does tend to rise pretty quickly even when i am just resting. i also felt like these past few months, due to how inactive i am generally or how unhealthy i eat that these may be heart palpitations or something si amilar. i am no doctor, but these past few weeks my chest and my heart especially have been making me feel generally uncomfortable. even as i type this now i felt a weird tightness near the left side of my chest that i can not help but periodically touch with my palm to check on my heart rate. after this experience i have finally made a personal decision that i fully intend to keep. i used to be the kind of guy who did not mind drinking or doing lsd or smoking weed and even thought about trying dmt soon. but now i really do not think i have any intention to use or especially abuse substances anymore because i am genuinely concerned for my health and i just really do not want to die. i may not feel happy all the ti ame. i may not be as social or even as healthy as i used to but i am not suicidal, or at least the real me, not the drugged up me, is not. i genuinely want to get help but i am having a hard ti ame doing so. the last ti ame i looked up my health insurance information to find a psychiatrist or therapist or something like that in my area that would accept my health insurance all i ever seem to get is the run around with voice machines that tell me to call other voice machines and never get anyone on the line that i can get to make an actual appointment with. it got to a point where i just gave up and thought i could figure things out on my own and even though i did for a while i feel like i can not afford to take that risk anymore. i am really desperately trying to find a doctor in the nyc area, preferably manhattan that wi will take empire bluecross blueshield insurance. i am sorry if i may be putting too many personal info here but i would just really like some kind of assistance in getting help. i have absolutely no problem making the calls i need and physically going to the locations i need to go but i could just use some direction. i really need things to change. i can not stand the thought of seeing my mother cry again from being concerned about my well being. in fact i am tearing up now just even thinking about it. i can not let this anxiety or depression or bi polar or what ever any of this is take control of my life. i just want to get better. 	moderate
i can not break out of this cycle of suffering i have lasted weeks without feeling anxiety and wanting to ki will myself, i worked hard on studying some of the topics i find interesting, read books and spent very little ti ame on my phone went to sleep early and woke up early with little to no difficulty took care of my hygiene regularly. but yesterday something happened like it usually does. i woke up feeling extremely tired even though i slept for and a half hours. my body just wouldn t listen to me. i could not focus on anything. taking a shower and brushing my teeth seemed like such a chore, reading was completely out of my reach. a little later i had a mental breakdown and was overwhelmed with existential dread, i really wanted to die at that moment. and now i am back in this state of despair. depression is back again. today i woke up with extreme difficulty and anxiety. i do not know what to do. i am just . but ever since i graduated from school it is been pure torture. i can not find a job. i have tried everything, i hated every single one of the jobs i could land. i hate my country. i hate dealing with stupid people. my family does not understand me. their ignorance and stupidity is driving me crazy. laziness is your biggest problem . what am i even struggling for? what goal am i working towards? my father is only joy in life is alcohol. he goes to the job he hates, just so he can get drunk in the evening. is the same fate waiting for me? this town is fi willed with mindless clones. i hate it. but i can not move. i have no money. even if i did, would it change anything? is money really the problem? or is it this world that is the problem? it is fucked up. i hate it. i just wish i was never born. i have nobody i love. i just wish there was someone that needed me. someone i could protect. someone for the sake of whom i would cli amb the everest and fly to the moon. but there is no such person. that is just how humans are. real life is nothing like books. real life is thisappointing. real life is boring. i am one of the many. there is no extraordinary goal for me to achieve. it is just a sandbox game with the only goal survive . sorry for wasting your ti ame.	moderate
what drowning feels like someti ames i lie in my bed staring at the ceiling counting the sheeps in my head counting the blessings. but i can only count the pets, how the trees dance when the wind blows. i tried to smile and started a conversation about the actress who broke up with her lover, and i laugh, and cringe, talking about nothing at all. i tried to get a job, working for years in this industry i am not really interested to pursue. i do not know the reason why i am there, why i need the money, why i need to solve the machines problems when i do not even know how to sort out my mind, myself. so i quit tried to think about my life, tried to think of happy things so as not to think about suicide. i went to see the ocean. i went to see the mountains. i went to see other cities, and it was exhilarating. but i sti will feel empty. i do not know what to do and i am running out of cash so i got a second job. i stayed for a little while and then i left. here i am now, typing these words at the living room. the neighbors are blasting their music and my sister is brushing her teeth. i tried to talk to someone, to everyone. but they do not understand. they only want the cars, and the big house, the money, and sex. they want to get married before the age of to poop tiny little babies, and work their asses off in the jobs they hate, running, circling the system they do not know that is existing or tried to pretend it is not there . i tried to date someone and i run off after the movie was finished. i am not interested with anything or with anyone. i am not interested with holding hands and sharing it in instagram. i tried hurting myself by a cutter especially when i know i am not being perfect. back in college, i tried to cut my thighs when i failed an exam. i do not like my major but i do not want to fail. i stopped eventually. i got bored and i became thisinterested about hurting myself. i tried social medias and it worked. for a while. but i got depressed more when i saw people posting their highlights while here i am, trying everyday to survive. i tried spending my ti ame in youtube and netflix, and i watched a lot of videos and movies, and it was all meaningless. i tried to plan and write down what i should do with my life but i lose interest after two days and really it is not worth it, i am not worth it. i think i have bpd . and anxiety. but i do not know. i do not want to go to a psychiatrist. i want to go. would they really help? or would they make it worse? what makes me sad is, i know that i have a bri williant mind and i know i am wasting it away but i just can not get out of this fog, this grayness. i tried to love myself but i always end up loathing her. i do not talk much nowadays. i created this thistance with my friends who only want to see my sunny side, who looked away at my darkness. i rarely talk about mental health with my family because, really, they do not understand. it is just all negative thinking and you can surpass it with faith and positive thinking. i gave up explaining a long ti ame ago. i keep changing my mind. in careers. i do not know what i want anymore. to be honest, i never see myself past the age of , maybe that is why. i keep thinking of what wi will happen if i swallow a lot of sleeping pi wills, or the feel of the knife when i cut my wrists like how hannah backer did it in the tv series, or how it would feel like if you hang yourself or pull the gun is trigger, what would be the fastest and easiest way to die? what would be the less painful? i am dying. i know it. something significan not, something burning with light is dying inside me and the books, and the music do not help me anymore. at first they do, but now, i only feel this gaping maw. i tend to cry a lot when i was younger because i feel so deeply, the hurts and the joys are so intense. but i do not feel anything at all right now. only this deep aching sadness. this deep ache of my existence. it is funny really, because i can see how the people around me do not know that i am drowning inside. they do not know i am walking at this edge of this precipice, and i am only waiting for the big trigger. i am so tired of all the triggers. i understand now how the people who ki willed themselves even surrounded by loved ones have done it. it is so easy to put a mask. and you know the worst part? i am not afraid anymore. it is like i know the next stage is to give up and pull the trigger. i can sti will smile. i can sti will laugh and talk about things and pretend because i know that when i can not hold on anymore, i only need to let go.	moderate
i am so lonely nobody ever wants me around. i do not have any friends. i do not feel like i even exist. while all my classmates are going to parties i slowly decompose in my room, in quite literal sense. i can not live like that anymore. what is even the point of such an existence? i wi will probably ki will myself this week, and nobody wi will even notice.	moderate

tempted to not recover after coming out of isolation while having a panic attack my face was racing with blood, the body was shaking and i was cluttering like shit. my mom helped me and listened to my suicidal thoughts. although she did not understand most of it, she really did a good job calming me for the moment. she also offered to commit suicide with me if i am so tempted. now, i feel obligated to change my life, even have some motivation, but i do not know where to start. i am sti will doing the same shit, wasting ti ame, oversleeping, over eating and sti will woke up with first thought of ki willing myself. i am sti will the same, sti will suicidal.	moderate
this world does not make sense this world does not make sense.... i am and i recently hit rock bottom as i have a serious drug addiction to cocaine. the world no longer makes sense to me, found out my ex recently slept with my brothers best friend who i knew since i was years old, my friends mock me for being slow and quiet, and i let my younger brother down as he saw how drugs has been affecting me. i have called my brothers to visit me one night since i was crying for help as i was walking through my neighborhood at am high on coke and drunk on beer. i began throwing up and sweating profusely thinking i was going to die as my heart felt like it was going to pop, yet at that moment i felt as if i no longer had to keep going with my miserable life and felt not happy but relief. i figured i would take a vacation with my friends to alleviate my depression but when i was with my friends i knew since middle school, i could not keep a conversation , i felt like i did not fit in even though they were my closest friends. as soon as i got home i tried to hang myself , i had the belt around my neck and was ready to drop from my ceiling fan but i was afraid my ceiling fan wouldn t support my weight and break and my parents would come in and take note of what i was doing so i did not go through with it, i had my suicide letter ready and was close to taking my own life. now i can not sleep and feel the world closing in on me and the thought that keeps coming to my mind is about how this world was not meant for me and any day now i wi will be found dead either from a drug overdose or hanging from my ceiling.	moderate
talking doesnt help i am not being funny but why is everyone the same when it comes to mental health? everyone says talking helps, no it doesnt for those people who are very depressed such as some of you guys gals and myself. why can not somebody be different and say actually it works for some people but not everyone and suggest something else. i think that people who have depression really understand and dont suggest the same old solution as everyone else. if talking helps, why doesnt therapy help for most? it certainly hasnt for me 	moderate
living without support as i sit here begging the thoughts to slow down and just shut up and be quiet, i am reminded of how bad it always manages to get and how i am probably never going to get better. i do not have anything i need to get better long term. i am jobless, in my early s living in a small community in my mother is house. i have debt collectors calling me every week. only like people in my family know i have a problem and none of them know i have tried to end it all. i am atheist in a community of very religious individuals so nearly all support groups here are well intentioned but can not provide the connections i need. the nearest therapist i would even remotely trust going to lives miles away. not that it would matter, what with the lack of licences, car, and good insurance plan cover the cost. and the real cherry on top is knowing that i probably have something that needs medication to help correct, medication locked behind doctors notes. i know the sadness comes and goes. but when it hits, it means business. the other day i found myself smiling and thinking to myself something is wrong here . and then i realized i was happy and the depression bag was no where in sight. it was a lovely fleeting thought. happy for a day. ready to fantasize about never need to worry or wake up again. i did manage to get on pi wills one summer after i got in once to see someone at college. they completely ki willed all the creative and color in life. but at least i was not actively thinking about pi will combination and how to thisassemble my razor blade. but as long as i am stuck living at home i wi will never be able to get prescription for anymore. i miss being unaware of how unhappy i am	moderate
do not wamt to go back but a can not go foward. do you ever hear people talking about how they wish they could go back to when they were kids? the fond memories, the childhood friends, the fun. the problem is i do not. aside from a few bright spots my childhood was horrible. i changed schools every few years so i dont have any childhood friends. my family always struggled financialy. my dad was abusive when he was around but took off while i was in middle school. my mom, though she cared for us has made it hard. the only thing that has kept me going is the light at the end of the tunnel. i have dreamed of space and becoming and engineer since middle school. ive persued that dream despite all of the road blocks put in my way. i have payed my own way through college so far using grants, financial aid, and working almost full ti ame i am at a community college . this week i was accepted to an aerospace engineering undergraduate program at one of the top public universities in the us and top in the western us. i cried with joy when i got it but now, days later i am miserable again. the light is there but i am so beaten its hardly enough. any advice? p.s. i come from a family where one is not allowed to have mental health issues but have finially begun to get help therapy for about the last month in secret. my biggest regret is that i could sneak to therapy back in high school.	moderate
i am ready to just end it all i do love myself i do, but it is not enough to keep me going. i know for fact, financially it would be easier for everyone in my family if i just died. i am not sick or anything and my family does love me but i am now just a burden. i dropped out of school because my friends told me to and i never liked working. no matter how much i try getting my life back together, i just do not have the motivation for it anymore after trying many ti ames. i live in a small town now and it does not give me any reason to keep trying. i lived in a big town with my aunt and uncle because they wanted to help me. we had many arguments and i fights because they told me i could not have friends, i could not have a boyfriend, i could not hang with family and all that. it was a shitty deal i did not find out until after i moved down there. i moved back to hometown because my mom did not want me having mental breakdowns down there anymore. no one understands and no one wants to help. i have tried many ti ames but anyone who listens to me just thinks i am just lazy or downright not trying. i had insomnia for about a year now and it was only fixed when i lived in the big town. i found a guy i fell asleep and cuddled with at night and it helped for that majority but like i said, my aunt and uncle did not want me to have that so i got in massive trouble for it. melatonin does not help either. i think eternal rest is just the way to help everything	moderate

i am making life better i have been meaning to post this for a while. i am currently feeling like shit, so i thought i would come here to complain about my problems, but i decided not to. i hate complaining someti ames, as much as i do. and this is not a criticism, but this subreddit is too negative, so i thought i should sprinkle a little hope and positivity. some background i was officially diagnosed with depression at years old, along with autism and anxiety. i consider myself a survivor of emotional and verbal abuse though someti ames i doubt myself if it was actually abuse, but that is what abused people do . i have struggled to make friends my entire life. it is pretty safe to say i was not popular, which sucked because of my terribly low self esteem. i used to have suicidal thoughts at different points in my life, until recently. i had considered suicide multiple ti ames in my life, although i never made any attempts. also until recently, i had a nasty habit of aggressive self deprecation. i am recently single from a relationship that i thought was the one , but upon having been dumped, i realised that i was mistreated, so i am kinda grappling with heartbreak and coming to terms with the feelings that come with having, for a second ti ame, allowed myself to be treated poorly in a relationship. i think it is pretty safe to say, starting in my, probably early teen years, i have not been a happy person, not for long at least. i constantly suffer from a anhedonia, which is honestly torturous because it stops me from doing what i really enjoy doing. having kind of brushed over my life history with shitty feelings, now to the positivity. i am exercising every night. it is not much, but it is something. i have taken up yoga i hate it, it sucks, it is painful, but apparently it helps with depression and anxiety, so i figured it is worth a go. point is, i have set goals and i am sticking to them. i started a tafe course australian thing weeks ago, and i love it i did two years of university and they were some of the worst years of my life. tafe is so much better for me. it is only two days a week, and i wish those days wouldn t end. i cleaned my bedroom a few weeks ago, and i have kept it clean. for the first ti ame in three years, i am making friends. i would love to build up the confidence to ask them out for a casual drink, or anything outside of tafe, but baby steps. could things be better? absolutely. as i am writing this, i am feeling shitty and lonely, and i just want someone to talk to. i am sti will struggling with anhedonia, and i want to enjoy myself again. but things are getting better. i finally have stuff to look forward to again. i was, and sti will am, sick of people saying it gets better , so i decided to make things better. i can not make everything better, i wish i could, but i am i amproving what i can control. i know a lot of people who read this wi will be like i wish this would happen for me , or i wish i could make friends , or i can not do this, or that , etc. and i am sorry. i wish this could be inspirational to someone, but i acknowledge the harsh, shitty reality of depression that things like that just do not happen for some of us. but maybe, maybe the fact that i am getting better wi will give someone, at least one person here hope that they too wi will get better. i can not promise things wi will get better for anyone, i especially can not promise that to myself, but i sincerely hope, as someone who has battled with depression for over half their life, and wi will continue to do so for a long ti ame to come, i desperately hope things do get better for all of you.	moderate

alone and tired everything is going to shit. my family, uni, and i can not even cry, because my bf calls me weak and annoying. is there something for me out there? what is the point of staying here. alone. i am so lonely. all i needed was a hug and some closure. i got various passive aggressive comments and some screaming. i am no one priority. that is such a hard pi willow to swallow. i thought that at least the man who swore loved me above anyone else, was here for me. but i am alone and tired of trying.	moderate
i am scared i am pretty scared honestly, my wi will to live has completely gone. it is so hard, life is so fucking hard for me, just getting up to brush my teeth requires all my energy and i have none left for the day. the amount of wasted days i have spent in bed are too many to count. the responsibilities left neglected are too many to count. the relationships i have destroyed due to my inability to be able to feel anything other than nothing haunt me. i let the people that are sti will in my life down constantly, i have never amounted to anything in life. i am ready, ready for a change, the drugs do not work anymore. hopefully that change comes soon, because if not, it may be my ti ame. until then, i wi will continue to be here existing, hoping for a better tomorrow.	moderate
i have no idea what is up with me i have a loving family, kind friends and a normal life. even if i do not have a lover, i do not mind it. the thing i do not understand is how am i depressed. i mean, i am only yet and i have not struggled tough financial problems or anything but i feel really bad. worst part is that because i have a good life, i feel like i do not have the right to be depressed and that makes me hate myself. only ti ame i feel ok is when i play video games. i do not smoke. i watch useless videos on youtube until like, a.m to directly fall asleep and avoid sadness and if i do not, i just cry in my bed for literally no reason. i thought some of you might lived the same things. how can i get trough this easily?	moderate
i have absolutely no idea who i am. i do not know anything about myself. i can not even form my own opinions. i have no interests. someone could ask me something as si ample as what are your hobbies? and i would have no idea what to answer. is this depression? when i think about it i have never been my own person. my entire life, i have just changed to be whoever the person i like most is. i never formed my own self. now i am alone in life and i am literally no one. it is so frustrating because i just want to be myself but how can i do that when i do not know who myself is? i try to talk to people about this and they always think i mean that i do not like myself. the other day my mom told me to not worry about it because i am an amazing person in response to me saying that it was hard to talk to people because i do not know what to say. what i mean is, i am literally incapable of forming conversations with people because i have no identity and can not come up with a single thing to say.	moderate

how do i motivate myself to study when i am feeling depressed? hi everyone, i am a senior in high school and have had depression for more than two years now not because of school . before i got depression, i was a perfectionist sti will am and very plan oriented and organized. now, i am the total opposite. i have a vacation now and had planned to study for my exams this week. monday i could not help myself to. tuesday and wednesday i did about hours of studying each day because i was feeling very motivated and excited. i was feeling good those days too. yesterday and today i am feeling terrible. i want to study so badly but i can not make myself to, even if i did, i would be thistracted with my depressive thoughts. when i think of studying, i get wave of anxiety all over me. i start to get it really hot, i have trouble breathing, i start to feel light headed and start shaking. i really do not know what to do. i want to do well in school but my depression is stopping me. i would appreciate every realistic tip to study even when i am feeling terrible which is most of the days.	moderate
no life plan i honestly never thought i would sti will be alive at and now i am just floating because i never planned out a career path or had any plans in general for the rest of my life. i have felt like shit for a long ti ame, probably since i was , and got bullied from year to year . i have adhd as well so it makes it doubly worse because it is just stacked executive dysfunction i am lost and i can not actually visualise a future because i am in a perpetual state of well you are probably going to die soon anyway and also that i just do not want to do anything. if i do want to do something i burn out or get sick of it really quick, and give up. i can not afford therapy anymore and even if i could i do not know how to vocalise what i am feeling even though we all feel and are going through an extremely si amilar thing. when i went to therapy it was pretty useless. i know that it takes going to a few different people but both of the therapists i went to just did not understand what i was trying to explain and it was too exhausting. i see a psychiatrist to get my adhd medication which really is not helping that much and he is a dumbass who said people ki will themselves wanting to look like you when i told hi am i was concerned about the weight i have lost since starting vyvanse and how it is affecting the rest of my life. i am or idk anymore and i have not weighed myself in literal years but i have never been over kg. last ti ame i got weighed about . years ago i remember being . kg and i have only lost more weight since then. i want to self harm and have realised i do it by not eating and just using the additional lack of appetite due to vyvanse as the reason by cutting or burning or hitting myself like i used to just to feel something i am just so exhausted and i take lamictal for anxiety which dampens all the emotions i feel so i can not even do it because there is no like ...... emotional push like there used to be wrt adhd extremely reactivity . it just seems like too much effort for something that is going to use energy and probably not feel like it used to someti ames i do go okay it is a choice and i am going to get better and we re going to do what we need to do and then i slip up on the tiniest thing, mostly bc of adhd, and i can not keep the momentum going. then it is a cycle yadda yadda you all know what i am talking about i am just rambling i guess idk idk idk idk gggggggghhhhhh	moderate

i am honestly so tired of keep moving forward . why can not i feel good now? i am in my early twenties and ever since i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster happy sorry for the pun, it is a reference to goodfellas . i was born in a shithole with a shitty dad and a mom that although she tries her best and i acknowledge that, it is far from enough. i do not blame her. her mother my grandmother is probably the worst human i have ever met and i can only i amagine what it was like growing up with that narcissistic parasite as a mother. anyways, my goal in life is si amply to get the fuck out of here and move to a nice place where i can finally be at peace, not having to be constantly thinking about the shithole i live or the shitty people around me. i am in my last years of uni and i know this moment in my life is coming closer. i know that after graduating i wi will do my best to get the hell out of here and never look back, so i can finally be happy. i even have a good amount of money saved for someone at my age that only had job in life. but my biggest fear is, what if i do not make it until this point? what if i go crazy and never finish uni? what if i finish uni, move out and this feeling of happiness is not here it is somewhere else never goes away? or worst, what if i reach my li amit and decide to end my life a few steps before i achieve this happiness that i wanted for years? i am tired of moving forward. i just want to be at peace.	moderate

how am i supposed to motivate myself to live, when i do not care about anything? not a rhetorical question, i would love some answers. i have seen psychologists and none have helped. i do enjoy some things... tv, food, good stories, sex, games, the usual stuff. but most of the normal anchors that bind peoples lives to the world are not present in my life. i have a loving family, but i do not care about any of them. i have a solid group of friends whom i trust, who make me laugh, who are supportive and fun to be around. yet if they thisappeared, and some have, i do not feel anything. the one redeeming factor in my life is my partner, but i am dragging his life down by being unable to push mine forward. i am almost completely apathetic in life, what am i supposed to do?	moderate

i feel like i sort of lost some memories or myself my trauma gained is mostly breaking out of those rose tinted views of my family. i did not realize until after that i idolized them rather than actually see them also as flawed human beings. i felt like they could do so wrong and i guess took the family wi will be there for you. too seriously. but yea since the fight or realization that made me question everything and scared of people and their intentions... i really did reset. i lost my love and even thislikes for alot of things. i, for sure have restarted into a blank state. everything just feels new but.. not. its one thing to having to start over and find what my interests and what hobbies i can do. or just figuring out what i want in life. but i feel scared and really weirded out. its not like i lost any memories but i lost that emotional connection to them? i remember what i was thinking or feeling then but the current feelings.. its like nothing. usually there would be a tinge of an emotion, right? i am just so confused. did i forget how to work or understand my own emotions? did or is anyone going through this? where you feel like a blank slate but as if memories or a personality was i amplanted into you..? you re just using your memories to be that person but have no emotional connection? or when you can look through your memories like a movie or a book but.. not feel? it could be one of your most favorite or memorable memory but now its unfamiliar. idk my current feelings in tact. i feel lots. but just towards old memories, old hobbies, old interests... no connection.	moderate
can not stop crying even at work or in public i am always at least a little sad but someti ames i have mood swings which are, to me, a mi willion percent worse than si amply being sad. i have them a lot and they are getting worse and more frequent. during these ti ames i can not focus on work and i feel guilty but i honestly can not help it. there are things in my life, like anyone else s, that are worth some anxiety and sadness but focusing on those things has become intrusive and my reactions to them magnified out of all perspective. i thought i had things under control the last few months but i have been sobbing at my desk off and on since a.m. today. i did all day yesterday too. it used to be once in a while a mood like this would hit but now it is several ti ames a week. i have to try to hide it from co workers but i doubt i am really pulling it off in our open floor plan office. they must think i am insane. i know they hate me and wish i would just quit. i wish i could too but then i would really be alone. crying at work is a problem, obviously, but i always hate going home even worse even though and because there is nobody there it makes no sense and the loneliness is the worst part of my life at this point. it depletes the joy of everything in my life. nothing seems to bring happiness or to be worth any effort when there is not another human being in the world who knows or cares. tv, books, hobbies, music all seem useless and devoid of any meaning without the prospect of sharing with other people. i might need help. i feel like this is now becoming a crisis. i am not constantly suicidal but during the worst parts of the worst mood swings i can be and it can be powerful and i am starting to worry about it. my feelings and actions as well as their i ampact on others seem out of my control at these ti ames. i am not looking for solutions. there are not any. no need for replies. i am venting in hopes of regaining some focus for the rest of the day. i wi will delete this post in a bit after this mood swing passes and my mind can clear a bit. thanks for letting me communicate at you.	moderate

i need help...i want to break out if somebody is reading this, id like to hear about other people is opinions about my situation. around years ago i went to a break up that made me reassess myself on who i really was in that period of my life. mostly for the past years while dealing with the whole ordeal has just been reaffirming the ideas that i wanted myself to become. it was sad. on relationships, i was the type of guy that would go all in, i would wear my heart on a sleeve, but i always get left out, i somehow develop anxiety for people coming into my life with so much meaning, into fear of losing those people. so for the next, i never treated somebody seriously. anyways on my last breakup, i somehow got tired of being too nice towards women, the phrase nice guys finish last always had an i ampact on me, so i changed my ways for years it was somehow a goal of mine to be an asshole, since i figured it was the opposite of who i really was, and for years i preyed on weak women and manipulated them i am not proud of those things , i play with their emotions and get inside of their heads most of the ti ame, at this ti ame of my life i swore that i wi will never go back to being in love. i despised love for making one is self vulnerable that someone might take advantage of your love for their own gain.......... but months ago i met a woman that made me take look at what i have become, we met in an unexpected way, she was different from all the women i have met well since mostly i toyed around weak women she was a breath of fresh air. she was strong, she is an artist, independent, interesting, she had a beautiful soul, she also has bipolar thisorder. we hung out a lot and every day i had the opportunity to get to know who she really is,. in some ways, oddly enough our relationship got inti amate enough where we only talk about life and our thoughts, there were ti ames where she would ask me to go to her flat and just so we could share the same bed, i respected this woman a lot, we never had sex but somehow the moments we have shared were more inti amate than sex... right now i dont know what to do. it feels like i am contradicting the ideas that i wanted myself to be years ago. i am scared to fall in love but somehow i am falling right now.	moderate

do not feel worth getting help. i do not know if anyone else ever feels like this, but this has been my experience. i have been pretty bad for the past week, but when i consider getting help i always feel like i just do not warrant it. there is always someone worse than me, and they should get help first, who am i to take their place when they could be getting better? someti ames i think i am just pretending. you know, maybe i am just overthinking and overreacting and everyone gets like this. i feel like an i ampostor. i am not diagnosed or anything, which adds credence to this somewhat. this might sound really bad, but someti ames i feel like i want to feel depressed just to have something to feel. this is a majority of what i have known, and anything else is just a derivation from the norm. if the feeling were to be taken away, then that is not me anymore. it is someone else. idk, just some thoughts.	moderate

how do i support a close friend in another country who attempted a suicide? a close friend of mine was diagnosed with depression, probably close to years ago. they have attempted suicide before but that was more from something external an argument . this ti ame, more recently about a month ago, they attempted another suicide but this ti ame it was planned. luckily they were found and received help on ti ame. i am their closest friend and they are too to me. i want to be able to support them but being in a different country with hours ti ame difference is making it difficult and taking a toll on me i have been staying up late to chat but i can not keep this up . also, one thing i have been struggling to grasp is that, most of the stories and posts i read from people who want to end their lives often state they want to end the pain but not necessarily want to die. and i have read heard this theme a lot but in conversation with my close friend, they just feel they do not want to live anymore, it is not the pain they are escaping. they understand i think how i and their other close friends feel about them. my close friend is other close friends are in the same country so they are able to visit them, but for me it is different. i am planning to visit them but that might not be for another months due to passport issues. i am looking for ways to support my close friend given my thistance from them. thank you.	moderate

what good is being there for me if i am numb to compassion? how should i respond when people constantly ask what i need from them, and i just do not know? my typical response is thanks, i wi will let you know. but almost always i never ask for anything. part of it is not feeling like i have the right to make anyone care for me. most of the ti ame though, i just do not know what i need. i appreciate and show gratitude to my wife and sister and friends who have reached out to me, but i do not know how to tell them how hollow i feel. there are no warm fuzzies when i say thank you. the feeling of being loved and safe that i used to feel in my belly when they said those things to me is no longer there. i feel ungrateful even though they do not see me that way. i am starting to recognize that people are reaching out to me less and less. friends return my calls less frequently or less often. maybe they are fatigued by the fact that i never seem to get any better. maybe they think i am not putting in the work. i have been on ever changing medications for over a year now, and in therapy for anxiety ocd and depression for going on years. are they drifting away because i am not asking them for anything? what can i ask for to show them i care but not cause a burden to them? it just feels like a waste of their ti ame, and i do not want to lie to them anymore and say that their words make me feel better. but i also do not want to hurt their feelings and lose them as friends. anyone else been through this?	moderate

i just do not want to feel like this anymore i am not suicidal, but i have i amagined what it would be like to ki will myself. i am just tired of feeling empty and alone and ugly and unwanted. i am tired of this crushing feeling of loneliness. i am married and i know my husband loves me but for some reason it just does not feel like enough, like he is just with me because he could not find anyone else. i have no passion for anything anymore, even the things that i used to love. the only thing i am looking forward to is finding out if i get to foster possibly adopt my nieces half sister, and my camping trip in april. i am almost and i do not have any kids because i can not get pregnant and it hurts so bad because all i have wanted since i was was to be a mom. the only friends i have are at work or in a different state, and i have not had a best friend in a long ti ame. the last person i considered a best friend told everyone else how anxious and stupid i was. any other friend i have had has always had a best friend and it is never been me. i always get passed up and come in second place, even with my family. i feel like i am nothing. and all i want is someone to tell me that i am cute and they want to be friends with me or they have a crush on me. sorry for the pity party. i am just struggling and i do not know who else to turn to.	moderate

i hate it here hey guys, you know when i am sad i always come here and read all the posts about how depression affects our lives. i had depression two or three years ago but i got better and now i think it is back again. it is not every day but there are those days when i feel lonely and just wish i could end it all. i do not know why, i am happy one day and the next i wish i was not born at all, it just hits me. anw, i just wanted to share with you guys that this subreddit somehow helps me go through the day. i hope each one of you gets better. love y all.	moderate
how the hell do i keep up with everything? i fucked up today. i have a strict schedule so that i can get work, school, and everything else done. even when i feel like shit and get hardly any sleep, i stick to this schedule because even going full steam ahead at it is only giving me micro steps towards a semblance of success. last night, for some reason i fell asleep early. i remember asking myself what i had to do tomorrow and not being able to think of anything. then setting an alarm for early in the morning just in case i did have something. well, predictably i slept in and missed something that i can not redo. it is put me really far behind on my schedule and i can only do it once a week no specifics , and now my entire semester is going to be hellish trying to make up for lost ti ame. how do people do it? how do they just follow routines like this every day? i made it months without mistakes and now i fuck up once and it increases my stress and workload exponentially. the worst part is i want none of this. i dont want the path i am going down. i just want to lay in bed all day until i muster up the nerve to ki will myself. i am far from the days where that was the reality, but this life isnt much better. i dont have any friends that i truly care about, and the ones that are around me are horrible influences. i am too socially awkward i embrace it because i dont know what else to do to attract women for longer than they look at me. i have failed my diet hundreds of ti ames, though i stick to my exercise routine. i am working towards something i dont want to be because i dont want to do anything! my depression is existential, which basically means everyone else patronizes me as some angsty teenager. but it also means i never wanted to do anything within reason. sure i would like to be a famous guitarist, but this is the real world and i dont have ti ame for that when i am supporting myself and getting an education. so i just chose what seemed like the least bad option becoming a teacher. i hate math and am no good at it, i do not know how to nor want to know how to code so there goes those professions, i have a phobia of blood so no medical stuff, i couldnt work an office job, anything you name it i have researched it and had no interest. how am i supposed to keep pushing on if i can only pretend to be happy all the ti ame, and then when i fuck up i instantly am a failure. i have no one who believes i am depressed. my dad is like a backwoods hick type, evangelical christian who thinks science is the devil etc... i live with hi am because hours a week at mini amum wage can not pay for an apartment, a car, and school. but everyone shames me for living at home. then if i got an apartment i wouldnt be able to afford the rest and people would call me a loser who isnt doing anything to i amprove hi amself. i can not win. for years i cried everyday and now i can not even cry because the numbness is back. i am constantly thistracted in my classes and i only pass them because i am highly intelligent when it comes to the humanities. my brain is all over the place, i have at least anxiety attacks a day, someti ames while in class, it takes me hours to write an essay because i can not focus. i get straight as but i am not pushing myself and it is not enough because i am deteriorating mentally this whole ti ame. i feel like i am going crazy someti ames and my physical tics are acting up as well. i thought if i worked hard i was supposed to build good habits that would stick. surely nearly a year of hard work would fucking do something. but i feel even more lost than i was in my suicidal stages. and the worst part is that the world just does not care. nobody cares that people like me are struggling, and they just see us as the weaker ones in the hierarchy and natural selection is weeding us out. it doesnt matter what desires i have to do good for the world because i am not cut out for them. just a week ago i thought i might have been doing better but now it all comes crashing down like this and it is out of my control.	moderate
obstacles to therapy, every ti ame i am , pretty sure i have had depression since i was a kid teenager and have never seen a professional. and while i have not often reached out to do so, the few ti ames i have, i have always encountered obstacles. as a teenager, my mom once became worried enough to find me a therapist...we met with them once not a real session though , but they didnt take our insurance and my mom never continued the search. in college, i reached out to the university therapists and was always placed on a waitlist, where i would never hear back from them. once they even stated that the waitlist was so long, i could choose to just be at the start of next semester is list, so i did. next semester came and went, never heard back. as an adult, i tried to reach out once to someone, they were not taking new clients. just tried again and apparently our insurance just issued us new cards, which nobody can seem to find...so i had to cancel my first appointment. and i know things like, someone not taking clients, or missing insurance cards are not huge obstacles. we wi will find reorder the cards and i can try again. but with depression, even little obstacles can just be so demoralizing, and i know that even once i get in to see someone, we may not click. they may not be right for me, and i have to start all over again. it takes so much energy to even get started, and i am already exhausted...	moderate
thank you to the woman at usps so one of the worst things about my depression is the horrible anxiety that comes along with it. today i took a deep breath and got the courage to go to usps to mail a package i would been putting off. it was packed and my anxiety took over. i walked up to the counter at my turn and handed the woman my custom is form and she said, you re shaking! are you okay and i kind of just stuttered our that i had horrible anxiety. and it just clicked for her, and she was so kind and helpful. encouraging me, and telling me not to worry about anyone else and that she would help me with the whole process. it was the kindest thing anyone has done for me in a really long ti ame. she went out of her way to help me calm down and mail my package. today is a good day, even though the anxiety and depression were horrible i saw some light in all of it	moderate

unpopular opinion? you have to love yourself before you can love others! i agree you should love yourself, take care of yourself, have enough self respect to find yourself in a healthy relationship friendship, but i see wayyyyyy too many people think that love yourself means become obsessed with yourself ... i think there is a huge difference between confidence and arrogance. i think healthy self love is having confidence in your worth as the unique person that you are, not arrogance in your best individual qualities.	moderate

i would not find a job before my body gives up. for the past months, i have been jobless and broke. every day i am searching for new opportunities, i even look for gigs, but i can not afford a car to get anywhere due to the repetitive failure in searching for a new job. that is only the beginning. because of failure after failure, i have nothing more than what is saved in my bank account enough to finish my lease, but not enough to survive afterwards. i can not spend any extra money outside of rent. in order to make sure all my bases are covered, i have oz of nuts and a glass of water as my daily meal. it may be food, but my digestive system, mental health, and weight have all deteriorated beyond what i thought was possible. i am not sure where my body finds the waste to painfully get rid of, but it loves waking me up at least ti ames before i finally get up i really do not remember my last hour sleep . however, we ll continue. i have not had toilet paper, feminine hygiene products, and other bathroom essentials in a very long ti ame. those of you who have been where i am know the incredible thiscomfort of making do if you re lucky and free bleeding if you re not. i got lucky at one point for about months as i had little to no bleeding, but turns out that was malnutrition which has only gotten worse but now i bleed very heavily as well . i never leave my room, but you can be certain during those weeks, i am even more reclusive. i have gone as far as stealing toilet paper from the gas station bathrooms, but that is rare. i can not bear knowing that this is what i have been reduced to in order to keep myself clean. we ll keep going. in months, my lease is up. i have been trying everything i can to get out of it early ever since i moved in august last year, hoping that maybe someone wi will finally take over for me and i can move to a cheaper home, closer to more job options even if it means walking an hour to work every day. not that would i would find a job. it is almost been a full year since i have been that lucky. i am certain if i do not get out soon, i wi will be homeless by july. a couch to crash on is out of the question. my reclusiveness caused by a plethora of mental i willnesses has made it nearly i ampossible to communicate with people in the real world, not that i really had friends before anyway. it is not like it matters if i find a new job though. nobody pays me over dollars . hr. never in my life have i ever seen more than that an hour, until it is somebody else. everybody else, even if they are just as new as me, has always been started around dollars which sti will may not be enough to survive at this age, but it is enough to keep them fed and sane until next paycheck. not me. never. i wish there was a better explanation but maybe i need to stop mentioning race, gender, and that i have a thisability. maybe that is why nobody wi will take me. i am everything an employer doesnt want because it makes me seem too slow or too stupid to do my job properly. if anything, i have an eagerness to work that my peers do not, and it is likely a product of absolute desperation to prevent my body from completely giving out on me, landing me in the hospital where i wi will lose everything i own and end up gone the moment i check out. i never would have expected such a bright eyed, friendly, little girl to have turned out so fucked up and ruined, beat down from mental and sexual abuse, bullying, and the occasional physical abuse.	moderate

i dont know how much longer i can try i started my first year of highschool out great. i was the top person in my grade, i had perfect attendance and amazing friends. i thought i was done with being depressed and wanting to harm myself but i am really not. i have slowly started to go back to my old ways of skipping school, sleeping in class and blocking everyone out. i can not keep trying to get better just to fail months later. i wi will have a good streak of telling myself i wi will get better or just keep trying and it works but it is always the same outcome. i start to feel numb again, slowly start showing my true feelings and being the opposite of who i want to be. i just want it to stop. i want to just stop being me. someti ames i wish there was a reset button on life	moderate

being a person with a personality? i never fit in any environment or situation. i have old ti ame friends and work colleagues, but i am more a ghost than anything else in social groups. i feel like anyone has its role there is the super talkative one, the smart one, the artist, the smartass, the cool guy... while i am nothing i do not think it is cool to be different because everyone should be able to fit in society, atleast to have people to interact and share things with. but i just can not, i am totally numb when people are around me and do not have anything to do or say except being kind, i guess. i can not build strong relationships, i do not hate people but i just can not. someti ames things happen, like someone says something i do not like, or i fail a small task, and i get totally blue and just need to go home and be alone. it is not about being suicidal, or lonely, it is just that i can not feel anything. i think that people usually consider me a nice person and wouldn t mind having me hanging out with them, anyways i am not close friend to anyone anymore and no one really likes or needs me. all my original friends strengthen their friendships every day, they do things together, they have things to talk and joke about while i get farther as ti ame passes. i am fairly attractive, but i can not get a girlfriend, because i have no character and never know what to say to be cool, fun, smart, or whatever. i always have been an introvert and struggled to emerge in social contexts because i feel my personality is so damn weak, but when i was younger i could have friends, enjoyed going out with them, having girlfriends. now my life is a black hole and i am only it gets worse and harder every day and i wonder where the problem lies. someti ames i think it is ok, everyone has it is needs and i am one of those loners who does not need all these friends, but that is bullshit, i alway dream of going out with that girl i like, or having a normal life, having people who care of me and respect me. but i have nothing and i can only sit in my room and browse the internet...	moderate

it feels like it is getting stronger i had to let my dad is ani amal outside while he was busy today. i am having a bad depression day. there is never any reason it just comes in waves. today a wave crashed on shore. i stared at my dad is loaded pistol today. i was crying too hard to see if the safety was on. i pointed it to my face. i did not pull the trigger. i did not want the cat and dog to see and have to be around the mess. it feels like the depression getting stronger. i feel more numb a higher level of numbness. i look at my friends and family and partner. i do not see someone i love. i i amagine their face and reaction when they thiscover i ki willed myself. i want to believe people need me here. that ki willing myself because there is no point is not a reason, and everyone here would miss me and they love me. i think those are excuses. deep down, i know everyone moves on. i know it. even mothers move on, just barely, but they do. i am losing excuses. i am tired of pretending i can keep doing this. i am exhausted playing a character with emotions and that is barely trying to get their life together. i do not want to try anymore. i do not want any reasons. i do not want any more tears. i do not want another sleeplness night. i am ready to give in to my depression. i can urge everyone else to keep fighting and move on, but i wi will never be able to tell that to myself. i wi will never beat this. i am just wasting ti ame. i am so tired i could scream. i am so tired of crying i could cry some more. i just do not want to try anymore. it is so hard.	moderate

unlovable, unwanted. today i found out someone i know is now modeling and they also got a partner within the same few days as starting to model. needless to say, i am jealous. i am ugly and fat, nobody would ever want to have me model for something or to date me. i am unlovable trash. i have started going to a new college and i have made a whole zero friends there. i talk to people often enough, but no one wants to talk to me outside of class or anything. on top of all this, i am transgender. nobody knows how to handle me. i am just a fucking dumpster fire, being dropped from place to place. i look like a man, but i am a woman. nobody wants to hear me talk about that or wants to know that about me, so i have kept quiet about it to everyone. better to keep it locked deep down inside of me than be out and have even less people talk to me.	moderate

my parents are neurotic failures my mother is a depressed, unstable neurotic and my dad is a sullen neurotic. they argued throughout my childhood, and that forms my early memories of them. they seperated when i was . they have produced a sullen depressed neurotic, who does not talk. they complain i do not talk. my grandmorber thinks i am unhappy . my mother shrieked at me the other month are you depressed i said no. she can not keep her mouth shut. she has nothing better to talk about, i have listened in to here telling people on the phone my medical history. i tell her nothing now. i really wish i did not exist. i have been alone through pri amary, secondary, sixth form. i can not easily describe how much i hate people. people are born amoral bordering on evil. one of my earliest memories is of an incident in pri amary school that has taught me this. it was break ti ame, a summer afternoon, and being in a rural area there was an abundance of insects. a cockchafer, an insect you may recognise by its iridescent wing case, had landed and i was watching it crawl over the grass. a few other children came over. i heard them talking and that they had decided to ki will it. i positioned my body over the bug, and they kicked me. several of them, repeatedly. i do not remember what happened to the insect. people are thisgusting. out of all my experiences, i can only find thislike for nearly everyone. no one my age has ever shown affection towards me. they all seem to show thistrust, they all seem to think i am somehow cruel. ironic. at that starts to wear thin.	moderate

hypersexuality as a coping mechanism hi. i hope this is not too forward a question or inappropriate. have any you had problems with hypersexuality as a coping mechanism for your depression? i wi will be honest and admit i masturbate way way way too much, watch way too much porn etc for those short bursts of dopamine it triggers in my brain. i can not tell if it is perhaps a coping mechanism or not but i at ti ames have next to no sexual desire or fantasies during but just do it out of habit, probably because of the dopamine it triggers which in return leaves me even more depressed, shameful and exhausted afterwards . does anyone else have a problem like this or can relate? i mean by all measures hypersexuality and depression does not sound like it mixes well but i have this idea it might be the case for me.	moderate
so this is rock bottom not sure what else i can do from this point, so i am going to sum it up here in the hopes it wi will structure something today for me. these past few years have been the hardest ti ame for me, tried to move out and could not do it.. left feeling so lonely i lost my emotion and sti will do not have a grasp on what i feel every day. moved in with my grandparents to then watch my grandad go from my father figure, the man who taught me how to shave to watching hi am die in my front room to cancer. i have tried to get into a relationship to stop this empty ache for it to fall through because they are broken in their own valid and painful way. the only reason i am sti will here is because of my mother, the only reason i sti will get up is because i do not want to let anyone down. i am not sure how i can live like this for too much longer, i just want something stable and for someone to help me feel something again.	moderate
i am giving up, and with nobody to listen i am turning to you i have given up, and i am not sure what is next hi guys, i am sorry to be so short. i m have been living my life alone, forever, until i fell in love. my relationship lasted a long while, few years, until today my girlfriend left me. aside from her and her family, i do not talk to a single person. i live with her, we share our entire lives, and she left me. i now feel alone, and to be honest i just want to die. i have felt this way before, even attempted, but i have never been successful. now i feel i am at the point where i have to do it. i do not want to live another day that nobody cares about me, it hurt too bad before and it hurts now. i just felt like i had to let someone know, tell someone how i am feeling, because i do not have anyone to listen. i can live, especially not like this. if you took the ti ame to listen, thank you do much. i am sorry	moderate

i have nowhere else to vent. i am unsure if my problens are valid enought to be posted here, but i have niwhere else to vent. sorry in advance. i am not sure whether i belong in this community, with my problems but i am going to type away because i dont have anywhere else to vent. its honestly a mess. you wouldnt understand what i am about to say either, but here goes. i promised myself after exams were over, id treat myself to a great life in the next months of holidays. but absolutely none of that have been great for me. i planned on playing alot of games, getting alot of money in my first job, spending ti ame with my friends, being generally fucking happy. but right now, i feel like i am stuck in a li ambo of feelings. am i actually sad?depressed?confused?unsure?or maybe i am mixing all of this up for just momentary sadness. i dont know.i can not read my feelings anymore. i am numb?.sorry. i will try to stick to the topic. i have too many reasons for feeling this way too many to comprehend, but i will dive into some i guess. i didnt get to do any of what i wanted to do. my parents lied to me. they promised that after exams, all i am allowed to do is game like shit. unli amited play ti ame. for me, playing games is freeflow dopamine. unfortunately, i didnt get to play much, often i got into arguments with parents when they didnt allow me to play. it felt like i was betrayed. i believed in a lie for months, now ive been slapped in the face. i even worked for months like my father wanted me to when he made those promises again and again up ti will my exams in november. now is february, and playing hasnt been easy. its come to a point that when i do actually get a chance to play, its not as thri willing as before. the kick isnt there. that hurts. its my go to, but now even when i can go to it, i dont really want to. i think that is all i can pull out of my brain with that.. on to the next one. i have a problematic addiction to masturbation. i hate to admit to it. its not as bad as most, though. the problem with it is that my religion is heavily against it and everyti ame i do it, i just can not look at my family and friends the same way, i feel ashamed to be who i am because of what ive done. maybe i am exaggerating.but my thoughts have escalated to wanting to have sex with someone. not forcefully like raping, no. all this is messing with my head so bad. i know hormones are kind of the culprit, since i am going . i have a money problem. work has caused a shit ton of stress on me mentally and emotionally. i broke down at work a couple ti ames too. so, when i come to find out that i very well dont hve the money i should have earned, i feel betrayed. but i guess this just sounds like another case of a teenager getting a bite of adulthood.but seriously, it sucks so bad to see my money deplete when the most i spent on was food. not even the extravagant ones. work itself is a problem. the environment is toxic for me, and me working alone mentslly hurts me as i always have to deal with large workloads alone and it causes alot of stress. to top it off, i can not work there as it hurts my exceema on my body. but finding another job has been near i ampossible. either the jobs affect my health, or they require a certain ti ame i need to commit too that i can not. however, i havent ask a certain retail outlet because i am in fear. in fear of new enviornments and new people. my parents probably see me as a thisappointment. my mom and dad have been angrily shouting and scolding and nagging at me to study hard after months of not doing so a whole nother story of its own to score a decent grade. but i finally managed to and result came out in january. and i went from multiple c is and e is to as, bs and c. however, my parents didnt show me the same energy they did when they were scolding and nagging to my more or less good score. they didnt care. they treat me like i am sti will lazy. but a lazy person wouldnt have scored that. i worked hard. i was honestly thisappointed with my result. i was dealing with difficult problems that year, my grandma passed and studying was something i could do easily. so i felt that i should have been appreciated more. but i wasnt. it hurts to feel betrayed this way. i feel fucking worthless because of it too. moving on, my dad has always wanted me to grow up to be a basketball player, a ski willful one who made it to the nba. but not once in my life have i shown any intrrest in it or ski will too. so i think that is why hes never really loved me properly because i am a thisappointment. he didnt care about my results lol, he just wanted me to do what he wants. and it just continuously fucks my head up because i feel that he just wants someone to live his dream but i can not because i am fucking shitty at this and i hatw hi am at the same ti ame but when i stop to think about hi am on his deathbed, how wi will he feel about me? the ti am he commited to me, just for me to turn out into sonething far from what he wanted. i dont want hin to feel unloved or sad. but that is what he is doing to me. what the fuck do i do?i dont know anymore i hate living. its complex. life is full of lies. the best people leave you, and no one loves you. i had two best fucking friends. they knew me more than my parents. but one day, they just left. left me alone. i was shattered. now i have no one to talk to, and my thoughts are constantly confused and problematic and dieing feels much easier. i dont kmow if i am mentally i will or just exaggersting i dont know if my opinion matters since i am just some year old i dont. fucking know. i say i mastirbate and want to have sex but that is probably because i lack love and affection and happoness so if i start a relationship its probably because of those reasons but relationships are a waste of ti ame. people wi will just leave you one day. alone. fuck man. fuck. i am so fucked up. i dont even know rn,as i am typing this, whether what all i just said was valid. or am i exaggerating. or am i just a coward. or am i just a fat fucking loser. fuck me. i hate myself. fuck me. there you have it. youve reached the end. i know you can not make sense of any of this . its ok. me too. i am glad i could write a fragment of it down. i am hoping its accurate. i commonly feel different about some things. idk why. if you actually read all of this, i thank you so much. youve already done what no one else has tried to do. listen. 	moderate

i just want to die because i am weak and my sisters do not care that i am depressed. how do i stop getting depressed about what people say to me? i tend to become sad quickly, because i think everyone has bad intentions. i hate how i let words get to me, how easily i can go from happy to sad because of a few words that do not matter to the person who said them. i feel too sensitive and weak to live. people say things without really caring about what i ampact it can have and i just can not handle that. i have social anxiety so being around people is just a pain in general. if you do not want to read the examples then please just answer how i can stop being so sensitive example one my sister has a friend who is having issues with an abusive boyfriend. i have never met her. this happened a few days ago. her friend was supposed to come over, but my sister did not hear back from her. she said she met be dead because she knows that she had those thoughts before. i told her to call her because i was worried. she said no i have my own life to worry about. that really broke me. i was shocked because i thought what about me? your sister with depression. i felt like it meant that it does not matter if i died. i know she is probably the person who would care the most, but i am so hurt. please do not think sister is a bad person. she is going through a lot of stress right now and she checked up on her friend. example my other sister has her own life and mental health issues, therefore feel like she is taking her anger out on me. i know she is not the best with depressed people because she is insensitive with the feelings of others. i tried to call her out on her behavior last weekend, but insisted that it never happened. at the end she said i wi will just stop talking to you then. i believe she said that last week too. this morning it is like it never happened, but i sti will remember. last week she said it is lame how my only friends are my siblings. i just can not get close to people.	moderate

i fucked up my whole life over word. i dropped out of school for something which seemed like a good idea at that ti ame and it did work out for like year and i had a chance to secure my future for the next years but i was so fucking stupid and said no to let us say a job and then when i changed my mind week later they already had some else. i am just without a school degree, living with his parents, not doing anything at all everyday and wi will be probably be in debt soon which i do not want to talk about. my family is poor but because of my decision i made when i dropped out of school i could provide for them and help them pay off their debts. basically all the money i earned went into their pocket which was fine for a while but i told them i need to focus on my future but it was to late. i have nothing now and have a lot of problems at the age of . i do not know how i am going to live on like this in the next years. i hate myself for making the stupidest decision of my life. i do not want to ki will myself because of my family but i do not want to live either.	moderate

should i ki will myself because of interracial dating? pretty much i want to ki will myself because i am severely depressed and suicidal due to racist reasons, i guess you could say. i literally want to die whenever i see a white girl man of color couple, usually the guy is black. i am not sure why it affects me so much but it does. i feel horrible, inadequate, inferior and depressed. if i see one these couples i literally want to die i just can not take it. i guess i also want to die at the fact that like i ammigrant dudes from like the middle east just come to the western world and screw a bunch of hot white chicks from here. it makes me want to die. this is the main reason i am suicidal i have attempted suicide twice. i feel like the world is ending, for at least white people. because i have been to london and france near paris , both places were literally like people on the street were either black or musli am and i know that being racist is horrible but like it literally just looks like these people took over those countries. here in america, latinos and stuff have taken over completely, and asians too... but i do not mind as such because america belongs to no one so i am not really upset by this. canada also has huge musli am populations... and it just seems like a white people are dying off and being replaced and b christianity is dying and being replaced with islam in this part of the world. and for someone like me, a white christian... well, this is not good. i have absolutely no wi will to live. i do not see a future for me here. i wish i did not care but i just do. and it just depresses me all day everyday. i am probably going to get heavily attacked after what i just said. i deserve it. well, if i offended you, please assure yourself that i wi will probably be ki willing myself very soon, so you can all be happy knowing that. p.s i would also like to mention one of my parents is latino, so i have heard spanish in my family my whole life. i sti will consider myself white though. i also had a musli am friend who was my best friend for around years, and i was also best friends with a black guy for around three years. i have also seen my parent that is latino be racially abused and got very upset as a result, and i supported them. i am also third generation american. i did not even used to feel like this, it started a few years ago though. i wish i was not like this. but nowadays in america the amount of white girls who go for black guys is absolutely insane. it is noticeable and is a phenomenon. there is no way it is not true the sheer amount of these couples is crazy. there no escape for me. i feel like suicide is my only option. but people have told me it is stupid but it sti will affects me! i do not know what to do.	moderate

been feeling this way for someti ame i just felt like letting it out. i have been thinking for someti ame, if it is me to blame, it is like i want to do ani amating. or the work does not matter, but it is not the first thing i started out suddenly, but just what i could easily do without support. so, i have always been serious about anything i try doing, or so i think. i love piano, i wish, i could get one. and, i love art, digital art. my interest in piano has been there for long ti ame, but there were other things keeping it buried, and art, traditional art i kind of felt uncomfortable with, uneasy. it makes me uncomfortable and is tiring to get clothes dirty. and then is a bit stressing in general, for me. so, since i thiscovered digital art few years ago, i really wanted to do it. i did get into it, i tried a lot, but i only had computer with mouse. i did keep at it for someti ame, but it was really tiring and not satisfying, and everywhere i found that graphics tablets, even the cheapest ones can do wonders. so, i wanted one... and i personally believe, that talent does not come naturally, but is ones desires and interests in art or whatever, that is what makes one good at something. because, interest is what makes you want to get into something, to practice it, to get good at it. i wanted that out of way before continuing. ... so, i asked for it, though i did not get to hear anything like, i can not draw or be artist or something like that. i did get asked for what? where it was possible at that ti ame, my mother did not know what it is for, i do not think it was only that. even after finding out about it, i got to hear things like, can it really help? have i tried without it? why do i need it? and behind those questions was my experience over year or so. and to me it seemed like, deep down there might have been a question, if i can even do it. or, that art is not worth as it is not paying. it was just how i felt, from what i had heard from such conversations before. it was not really purely intuition based mind reading or prediction. well, in the end i had to give it up. then there was interest in piano i had, it is very si amilar case with this, i asked for piano and it was seen as why do i want one? have i tried other ways? what about using computer keyboard? and yes piano too, i did try playing in whatever way i could find. i did not ask for it based on nothing. then, i searched up beginner piano and came up with low price, but good enough quality, keeping check of price. i can tell, if something might be too cheap or too expensive, and my choice was based on what is most affordable, not only in general but for my family too. but, my father looking at it found it to be professional level, somehow. i do not want to blame anyone for anything, tbh. it just hurt me a lot. and yeah, like that i could not do that either. then, recently i tried getting into ani amation. this, i found to be easy enough, i do not know if it is only for me or what. but, it is something, i could even go as far as to make dollars in weeks, since i started. it is kind of encouraging, but because of how it went and is, also thiscouraging. i do not have my own pc, so, i only get like hours at most in a day, if i wake up super early, like in morning. but, yeah with this i want to be able to do freelancing, and for that i wi will need my own pc to be able to manage it throughout the day, as it is restricting to not be able to do anything other than some set ti ame each day. and feels insecure. but, with getting my own pc too, i seem to have pretty much no support, it is what is currently happening. and, then when i am asked to tell details and all, i honestly start doubting even myself. i feel, that i want to be trusted a little. because, i myself am unable to trust myself and tell if i wi will really be able to do as i say. it is kind of what has been happening over the years. i do not know if i am just making excuses, but i have been insecure and lonely. so, i need a little more trust and not be asked too many questions for everything. it is not like, i have ever been given much chance to try anything, i have liked, i have had interest in. so, i might never know, and unless i am trusted and supported no one wi will else wi will know either. sorry, it is super long. i kind of wanted to hear, what different people thinks about this. or, maybe, like my most posts. it wi will get buried under other posts. unnoticed. but, thanks anyway.	moderate
fighting depression without medication, any advice? hello people! i have been experiencing many symptoms of mild depression not wanting to do anything, spending a lot of ti ame thinking and not doing, and not feeling motivated. i do not want to go through medication just yet and i would rather save that as a last resort, so i am curious what you guys suggest for fighting depression without meds! side note going to a therapist is tough because i want to fight this without my parents knowing i am over , i just do not think they would accept knowing that i am depressed and the outcomes are heavily in favor of them not knowing .	moderate
i should be happy, and to my classmates i appear happy, but i am not. i should be happy. for the first ti ame in my life, i have almost everything going for me. i graduated high school early, i started college, i am getting a job. i have friends. but i am not happy. and i do not think i am going to be happy. i think part of it is constantly being yelled at by the staff who work in my group home over something that a. happened months ago and b. did not happen the way they said it did. everyone keeps telling me i seem happier, or i look great, or i am doing well. but they never stopped to consider the fact that my depression and sadness never went away, i just got better at hiding it because people would say awful things about why i was depressed. i was even told i was faking my depression. so yes. i am going to hide my depression from them, but it is getting so overwhelming and i do not know what to do. i feel like i am drowning and i can not get to the surface. i do not sleep, i do not want to eat. i just want to lay in bed all day and ignore everything but i can not because then the ridicule from my peers and staff come back. i just feel like i can not ever win...	moderate

what is the point? i do not mind if no one reads this as i just need to get it off my chest. what is the point of it all? people tell you not to ki will yourself but they have no clue the pain you go through everyday. i am a year old male who had to drop out of college, quit work, and give up everything i love at the age of due to a mysterious sickness that runs rampant and controls every bit of my life. it was not until recently that i was diagnosed with a mycotoxin i willness something that is very difficult to treat i believe i have many other undiagnosed i willnesses as well. my mitochondria has been hugely affected by this i willness, and i wake up everyday with extreme joint aches , muscle pain, brain fog, and just straight up confusion. i did not realize how much i had taken for granted until i got sick, how great my memory used to be, and how good my skin, and body used to feel. the fact that i used to complain about being tired baffles me, as now i have reached a new level of tiredness. i have lost pounds , my hair has thinned and some of it has even fallen out. i have had dark rings under my eyes for the past three years due to extreme insomnia and being so uncomfortably skinny to the point where my bones ache on my mattress. i take around something supplements a day and eat incredibly healthy but feel that nothing has helped with my sickness. i feel like i am dying, but my body just si amply wi will not die. i was professionally told not to exercise as it would only deplete my mitochondria even further , but it is been too many years of hopelessness that i have begun to exercise again which feels i ampossible but i push through it is very difficult for me to socialize with this sickness as it affects my brain and has caused me great anxiety in mostly all social situations , but i have become better at controlling my anxiety. i have basically lost all my friends, but truthfully when you hit rock bottom you realize there is no such thing as true friends as everyone unfortunately stops caring after a while. it sti will hurts me. the worst part is your family stops caring, and they give up on you. before i became i will i was the fittest i had ever been , and i was doing well in school and life. i had a beautiful girlfriend, i was surfing everyday and just really enjoying life. i had worked many overti ame shifts at a pizza delivery place through the years and had managed to save up dollars k , which was something i was genuinely really proud of . my goal was to create a better life not only for me one day, but for my family. that is why it breaks me even more to see my parents age while i lay here thisabled in ailment . the worst part is no one truly understands, that is why i have lost friends and my relationships have crumbled. the first few years hurt the most when it came to broken relationships, but i became stronger and saw it more of a blessing as most of my friends were never really the ambitious types to begin with . i feel like a bird in a cage, i feel completely stuck and i have felt this way consistently for three years. there have been many ti ames where i want to end it all, but i am too afraid too scared to see what lies ahead. i am completely aware that there are many unfortunate people just like me, many even far more unfortunate. but to me that is all relative, it does not make my situation any better. i feel so belittled by society, i feel so broken and destroyed that it is overwhelmingly difficult for me to get up out of bed in the morning and tackle my daily tasks. it is even difficult for me to type this out right now as my brain is si amply on fire. somedays i feel like i am becoming healthier so i become happier and live a little more, and then the next day i wi will wake up and i wi will be back on square one... sick and mentally drained. this inconsistency is what drives me insane. it is like i am constantly getting a whiff of life but never really getting to taste it and enjoy it. my physical symptoms have created many mental symptoms. i am very mentally i will, i have no one to talk to , and that makes me feel so very alone.	moderate

i want to turn my life around for most of my years living in planet earth, i felt that i have always been stumbling around ai amlessly. there were many ti ames i felt that the rest of my life wi will remain that way and honestly i would be fi willed with misery and hopelessness every ti ame i thought of it. fortunately i was blessed with a few good brothers and sisters and a caring family. although i was near insanity, i managed to hold on and endure. i know that my life sounds sad and depressing but i do have many happy memories, most of them spent with family and friends. if it was not for them all i wouldn t be able to come to my current realization. it all started when i thiscovered ani ame, manga, and nooks. i have kept it a secret from pretty much everyone that i love to watch ani ame, read manga, and novels. i kept it secret because i knew i would get slammed if i ever get exposed. especially during elementary and middle school. the schools i attended had a decent plague of delinquency and i witnessed and participated in pretty harsh stuff. looking back at it now, that was probably what made me start losing my vision for my future. many people, including me, were so obsessed with their reputation, social i amage, and such that they were wi willing to step on others just to raise their own standing. of course i did some despicable stuff too mostly because i wanted to fit in . especially as a filipino i ammigrant, i was kind of desperate to make friends and so before i knew it...i was doing dumb idiotic things with dumb idiotic want tobe gangsters. it was not during high school that i started to open up and change the way i acted. my family and i move to a better town and it felt like a fresh start. that was where i met some decent friends, and everything seemed to be a bit easier not worrying about too many things. well high school was actually pretty horrible. all the dumb drama that i was pulled into. i dreaded going to school, all i cared about was playing and having fun with friends and so i deliberately let my grades fall to a shameful level. things go on and i eventually graduate, and that was when sh t started spiraling towards the abyss. as a filipino with filipino parents, it was expected of you to work in the medical field. i did not really care since i did not know what else to do so i accepted and applied for courses for nursing at a local college. unfortunately i have not gotten rid of my habits from high school. the semester ended and i had horrible grades, thus failing to meet my parent is expectations. my parents and i argued for what seemed like ages. what made it worse for me is that i knew that i was in the wrong but that only pissed me off even more i always ended the arguments by spouting bs and running away. i isolated myself from everyone, i would barely come out of my room. a year passed just like that and i ended another semester with horrible grades. at this point i was at my lowest. i was just so tired of everything. tired of the world, tired of society, tired of my family is expectations, tired of everyone, and i was especially tired of myself. i spent most days staring into space as i regret everything that i had done wishing for a chance to redo my life, wishing for someone to come save me, i wished for all of it to end. i am not sure when it started but i eventually changed. it was like someone flicked a switch and all of the sudden i started moving again. all i can seem to recall is that i read something very tragic from book and right after that my mind just straight up exploded. like an old machine suddenly starting up again. the rusty gears started moving as the puzzle pieces came together in my mind. i had a realization... this whole ti ame i was so focused on hating myself and regretting my decisions that i had completely neglected my surroundings. i thought of my three younger sisters going through the same thing i did at school my mom who cared for the whole family even though we always stress her out my dad who was the only one working to support a family of six yet sti will has the energy to work on his other projects my two older sisters worrying about their own families my best friends who have their own fair share of troubles... all of it just shot into my brain. my family looked fine from the outside but in truth, we sure were a fine mess. after my realization i had decided that i needed to just let it all out. the next day i told my family that we needed to have a family meeting. the meeting quickly turned into a bawling session as we talked about our regrets and thoughts on everyone is current situation. after we calmed down, we managed to talk about the future and what must be done. we talked about how my sisters should keep their grades up in preparation for college. we talked about how i needed to keep on going to school get my degree so i can get working. we talked about many more things before having to go to sleep as everyone had obligations tomorrow. the world suddenly looked a little brighter to me as i now had a goal in life. although i sti will was not sure if nursing is what i truly wanted to do, but i sti will smiled and walked forward because my family and i were finally united in something. epilogue ? months pass and things are going fine. i am sti will watching ani ame, and reading books and manga. i have also recently gotten into cooking and have been making meals for the family. i am sti will doing courses as i continue to think about my future. almost a week ago my dad came home from work and gave me a book he got at a book signing event. he told me about when he wrote a book about hi amself. boom my brain explodes as i have come to another realization... my

can not stop thinking about the past please help hello. i am writing here because i think that i need some help. sorry if my english ski wills are not the best, but that is not my native language. basically, my problem is that i can not stop thinking about the bad things i have done in the past and that i always need to talk with someone about it, then i can rest for a few days before i start thinking about it again... the thoughts are mostly about scams in the internet, because when i was years old i scammed someone for few dollars, and i did it again few more ti ames. almost everyti ame it was some low amount, not higher than dollars. the only one ti ame it was dollars, it was a skin for a video game. i feel very, very bad after doing each of these, and i always felt i need to give it back in myself. i did what i could, but there are few situations where it was really hard and i could not always give back, but most of the ti ame i did. what hurts me the most, for now, is that there is a forum on the internet where i had my account registered when i was teenager, and it can be connected to my real identity. there are some cringe posts as well, i do not want anyone to find them. the forum is related in some way to one scam i did, for let us say, dollars. i can not delete it as the account is banned. but my mind always goes there as i know how to search for it to think about the scams and i can not stop thinking about it. i have even feel suicidial, because of that. also, there is something inside me that makes me tell everything bad i do to my parents. i do not know why. i do not want to tell them about everything so i have some secrets, but it hurts me. i am also scared of their reaction someti ames so that is why i can not tell them everything, but they know about few. their reaction was not bad almost all the ti ame, but sti will, i do not want to tell them everything... what i need is to stop thinking about it. stop thinking even if there is some smallest evidence that i did something bad the forum i mentioned . please help me with that. i wi will read every of your reply and try it. i wi will probably delete this post, please i beg you to not archive it. i can not really start to live life , because i always think about the past. i could do so many awesome things, but instead i am wasting my ti ame everyday. please, help me. thank you all.	moderate
i do not want to ki will myself anymore but... i do not want to ki will myself anymore but the thought of death is sti will almost soothing. i no longer see myself slitting my wrists or taking all of my prescription medicine. but the thought of becoming terribly i will or getting into a terrible car wreck does not leave my mind. instead of suicide i am patiently waiting for something to happen that could potentially do the job for me. it is a sick and twisted way to think but at least i am not actively searching for ways to ki will my self.	moderate

outed by my friend my friend and i are both teenage males. a while back, he started streaming his gaming for fun because he enjoys talking to people. however, he started out very unconfident in hi amself. since i enjoy his personality, i would always tell hi am how fun his streams are. not to tell hi am what he wants to hear, but because he seemed to need the confidence boost and i really did feel his streams were exceptional. he put a ton of effort into them. this went on for a long ti ame. i would always watch his streams, give hi am good feedback, help with ideas, give hi am money to get more games. i wanted to support hi am because i love hi am as a friend and know how i amportant his streams are to hi am. leaving that for a moment, but it wi will be i amportant later. one night recently, he was telling me about some of his personal issues. he never opened up to anyone about his mental problems. i comforted and told hi am i would always love hi am and i wi will help hi am through his problems. i would help hi am get the professional help he needs. i went to his counsellor meeting with hi am, and his doctor appointment because he was nervous to go alone. he sti will has problems obviously but he is on the right track to helping hi amself. a couple nights ago, i thought i would tell hi am about my own mental issues. i suffer from a severe mental condition, and because of the stigmas, i have never told anyone. he got extremely mad at me. he started saying how he hated me because i was always fake. whenever i told hi am his streams were good, he felt i was insincere. he thought i was being fake by helping hi am with his issues. he then said that people need to see the monster that i am. he screenshotted the messages where i talk about my issue and sent them to our whole friend group. i guess he was trying to warn them of the person i was. and i wi will stress that it is not an issue that would make anyone fear me. i am sitting here stunned. i was honest with hi am the entire ti ame. i was never insincere with my support but he is so determined that i was. i think people are allowed to have secrets and i am angry that he told everyone mine when i never told anyone about his problems. i am also angry that my kindness was taken for granted. i do not want anything in return for what i did. but getting hated for what i did? being made out to look like a bad person? it is very hurtful considering the ti ame and effort i put towards hi am. am i a bad person for how i acted? am i bad for thinking my friend wronged me?	moderate

depressed and having a hard ti ame eating i am going to try to make this as short as possible. i am , have been depressed before, and have been seeing a counselor for the past or weeks. my depression a few years ago came from alcoholism from my mother and stupid high school shit. my moms alcoholism is really bad and has been. i wrote a note to her before leaving for my semester at college that i can no longer talk to her because nothing is going to change if i do nothing and she is going to drink herself to death. i call my dad a few weeks ago he says she is sober and everything is perfect. i decide to call her for the first ti ame in a month and a half a few days ago. of course she answers the phone shit faced. i was sad before but that really broke my heart, and i feel myself spiraling downwards. i know how to combat it and i am ready for the fight because depression wi will never beat me, but i lost my appetite right there. and i just can not eat. i have been trying my best but the food is not going down. it feels like i am going to throw up anything i put down that is more than half an entree. this is brand new to me and i do not know what to do because i am underweight already and have eat jack shit in the past few days. does anyone have any tips? i would really appreciate it 	moderate
can not stop thinking about the past looking for help and advices hello everyone, i am looking for help, regarding my problem, which is that i can not stop thinking about the bad things i have done in the past. i have posted here once today already, but i deleted is as i needed to rethink what i have written. here is the new version. sorry for my english not native speaker . i can not stop thinking about the bad things i have done in the past. what it includes is mostly internet scams. i was teenager then it started at age and i have scammed multiple people for dollars in average. someti ames it was less, someti ames it was more. it seems like it is not a big amount but for me it is. after every of these scams i felt i need to give it back , so i did. where it was possible, after some ti ame i decided to give it back and say sorry, but it was not always possible that is what hurts me. the biggest scam was a video game skin, for like dollars. i gave back as much as i could then, but never could say sorry. i think i might be able to do this in the future then i wi will do it. i think i did it because i got scammed few ti ame myself as a kid too, so it was some kind of revenge maybe. for the source of this problem i can see an internet forum as for now? who knows what my mind wi will suggest me later. where i registered as a teenager. i scammed someone for like dollars here and let us say the forum account is in some way linked to my real identity and i can not delete it as it is banned. i tried talking to the administrator but no way. as i know how to search for it, my mind goes there very often. i wish it could get deleted, but it would not. the forum account also has some low quality posts, as i was a teenager then and i did not think about it. i think i am in some way scared, paranoid that someone can dox me in the future and find these posts. they do not include anything really, really bad, and no real evidence of the scam itself there. i am just being paranoid. i do not know how to stop it. maybe i am scared about someone doxing my past too? also, there is a thing in me , that tells me to say about everything i have done bad in the past to my parents. i told them about some of the bad things, but i also want to keep some secrets. i do not want to make them sad or be angry at me. i think it happens because they always considered me a good person, and they do not know about the bad things i have done. it looks like i am trying to change their mind in some way, by telling them these things, but that is not my intention. i am a good person and i know it. i did not scam anyone for a few years now and i consider myself as a good person. i wouldn t scam anyone ever again, even if someone would give me access to his bank account or something where i could take his money anonymously i wouldn t. i am serious about it. i just feel like i need to tell them about it. i have talked about it with my closest friends, and most of them know what i did in the past and they say that everyone did something dumb, and i should look on the past as some lesson. but i just can not forget about. i am also scared that someone who knows me in real life wi will find the forum or something and make fun of me. i do not know why. i know the threat is not real. i just do not know how to fight it. my friends have seen the forum and said there is nothing i amportant in there and the posts are pretty good as for xx years old do not want to put the age there and that others in meanwhile were playing games wasting ti ame while i decided to do something. i think that i could do really amazing things if i could just stop wasting ti ame thinking about it. what really could help me is getting my past erased some way. i would really want to be born again and not do the same mistakes. i am good person for now i know it but if other people find my past and that is possible then my mind thinks it is over for me. when i was writing this post i feel really good. i do not know how to describe it. it is like going to church to tell about your sins. i feel clear. but also, in the same ti ame i feel there is something bad , idk, like i am not clear fully, but in . please help me do something about it, any advice is really appreciated and i wi will try it. thank you.	moderate

despite the rise in mental health issues and suicide in mid life, stigma and shaming persist. i wi will never forget this moment. i was with a group of not close friends because of course i do not have close friends , late s to early s. talking about a friend no one had seen in awhile and the conversation circled around to her struggling with clinical depression. one friend said, paraphrasing here, is not depression for teenagers, is not she a little old for that, what is wrong with her. i felt so ashamed. i sat there and said nothing. for those of us who are older, we re fighting an added stigma. i am not trying to make this pity olympics, please do not mistake my intent. i am just wondering how many people like me suffer in silence because we re afraid to come out as people who struggle with mental health conditions in a world full of misconceptions and without empathy.	moderate
i am so troubled and misunderstood this has taken me a while to write but these past years have been horrible and only have gotten worse. i have told my mom and my brothers how i feel but of course they do not understand or care enough to try to understand. the other day my brother came over to tell me how big of a failure i am and that i am a bum and i wi will be nothing in life. this was all said because i am and i dropped out and do not have a job due to not having my license and no car. and i am not a fucking bum, i just have a bum lifestyle. smoking weed, getting drunk, taking adderal , hydros , vaping. whatever. bum things sure. i am just surrounded by it all. my mom does not give a fuck and my step dad is an idiot who lets his kids do the same thing. and i do them because why not, it is being handed to me and i have nothing better to do besides laying in bed watching netflix or on my laptop. my mom tells me oh my god you do nothing all day but lay in bed and do nothing but i dropped out due to depression and body dysmorphia, wanting to do homeschooling but of course my mom would not go to the school and unenroll me. she is also the reason why i do not have a license. i did not drop out to do all that shit wtf and that is what my family does not understand. i want to do so many things, i want to graduate, i want to get a job. depression is a bitch and it does not help when my whole family does not understand and put me down all the ti ame but they know i cut myself and i have told them straight up i rather be dead and want to ki will myself. it also sucks being so poor. my mom probably does not have over dollars rn. no bank accounts or anything. so i understand why i am not getting the help i need or getting the homeschooling started. my life just fucking sucks. i do not know what to do, i do not know what they want me to do. i should go to school but i would do a lot better in homeschooling because in school, i am constantly thinking about how i look, going to the mirrors to look at myself and can not focus on my work or in class because add, and the repulsive thoughts that comes with depression and bdd. i just think ki willing myself would prove my whole family that i am not fucking playing but if i ki willed myself, i break down knowing that i would die never accomplishing all these things i want to do and that i would die without ever feeling peace with myself and real happiness. it really hits hard but maybe they would finally understand and just be like oh shit she was not lying but it would also ki will them. besides them treating me like shit, they love me sure. no sympathy or respect or support but i know if i ki willed myself it would break them. i do not think if i was dead no one would care duh they wi will fucking lose their shit but well, i think they deserve to live with realizing they did not do shit to help me and live with knowing they made it worse. this post is a mess but i do not know how to say it in any other way. this is the end sure of this post. advice? i have sat down with them and explained everything but welp, they sti will dgaf and would not give me shit for a little but go back to calling me a lowlife nobody , bum, failure , lazy or if they do listen they are like well blake you do not even try . said this before , i am not depressed because i do not do anything , i do not do anything because i am depressed. and i do fucking try. i take care of myself, as much as i hate myself , i am talkative. i openly talk about how i feel . i just can not do much. i think getting a job wi will help but i would have to take the bus which i am meh with. i have anxiety over specific things but i am down to try things. not afraid to try new things out so please let me know anything you might think wi will help this situation. i think once i get in my homeschooling, therapy or some shit. and getting a job would also show my family that i am not a weak scared pathetic lil bitch like they think i am. but again poor as hell so. alright i am done. drops mic. this is messy but y all get it ig	moderate

my phone is a constant reminder that nobody gives a shit about me. i do not know why i keep checking my phone as if someone wi will suddenly magically think about me and text me. as if. nobody ever texts me. or calls. maybe a small part of me wishes that just once, i wi will unlock my phone and see that i have a text. or a call. or anything. a sign that somebody...anybody from the useless list of contacts wi will care enough to say hi. i have not gotten a text in months. unless i am the first to reach out, which is always, nobody ever thinks about me. occasionally i wi will get a new text and i almost cry of happiness i know i am pathetic only to realize it is just my mobile provider alerting me i have used too much data. and then my heart sinks again. i do not even know why i have a phone. it is a constant reminder. nobody wants me. nobody cares if i am alive or dead. truly. nobody does. i am so lonely someti ames i talk to myself. i wish another voice would answer. a voice that is not my own. someti ames i wish i was crazy and could hear voices. anything to feel less lonely.	moderate

i am hiding in a closet at work so i can cry. i am a stay at home mom. i sacrifice a lot for my son and my family. my long ti ame partner and i have a really bad, toxic relationship but i have nowhere to go and can not afford to support myself with my baby. i had been pretty content lately. i quit my full ti ame job a few months ago and have dedicated myself to helping my son along with his therapists he has a speech delay . i am able to more efficiently take care of the home, the errands, cleaning and cooking, and everything else. my partner just goes to work and comes home. he does not help much at all, except maybe loading the thishwasher at night. i work part ti ame in the evening now as we need the money. i have let go of many hopes and dreams. i was studying my bs in web development and i had a . while working full ti ame and being super mom but for economic reasons, i had to quit studying. i have been living with my partner for over years now and i know we re never going to get married. i let go of that dream too. i let go of being able to be financially independent because my son needed me more. my partner has not been the best to me and in turn, i have retaliated and our sex life and inti amacy are dead which is something he argues a lot about. he gets angry but wi will not put in the effort to make me feel loved and appreciated. now my partner has noticed lately that i was happy and even made some off handed comments with some oddly thispleased faces like why are you so happy?. but the other day, he started telling me i was sad and wasting myself because i did not want more. i told hi am i have all i can have for now and when my son is in school i wi will be able to do more but that i was happy. he told me i needed to want more because he was not happy with this life. he wanted more money. i told hi am that we re in our mid thirties and at this point, it is incredibly hard to make the kind of money he wishes he had. he got angry and we started yelling at each other. i kept saying i was happy but if he was not, he could always do something about it. build the business he always talked about, get a better job if he wants to make more money. what i understood in this argument is that he blames me for being poor but the reality is that we re better off now than when i worked. we re saving dollars a month in childcare. i am bringing in more with my part ti ame than i was by working full ti ame and paying daycare. our bi wills are paid! he wants me to be responsible for his dreams and his goals. when i worked, i was an anxious mess. always in a bad mood and stressed out. he hated it! he told me i was too negative to live with. now that i am happy, it bothers hi am too! i went from feeling happy and in control to being this mess of a person. i am sobbing at the drop of a hat without warning. i can not control it. i want to just thisappear. i can not ki will myself and i do not want to but god, i just want to not be here. i do not want to do this anymore. i feel like a fucking idiot crying at work and yet he is mad at me. he is always mad at me.	moderate
life has been so hard.. this is posted on a new throwaway account i have been feeling so horrible for the last few years. i have always dealt with depression, mental i willness diagnosed with schizoaffective at age , and suicide ever since i was a child going in and out of mental health facilities. however, the last few years have been ki willing me...i am only and two years ago my mother died from brain cancer...i was suffering in hs from bullying and more but i managed to push through because she wanted me to. now outside of high school..my life has been worse my grandmother has been collecting ss benefits from me that i did not know about until recently and i have never touched any of that bucks a month which i could really use myself to better my situation... i left home because my home situation was not ideal to say the least..i was staying with homophobic family members who often talked about cutting off gay family members and being thisgusted by lgbt folk and even labeling them as racist...as a closeted gay person those words hurt.. in my new place everything was fine until my roommate threatened to physically hurt me because he thinks i molested his cat due to the cat going into heat as soon as i came..i no longer feel safe and he said if he senses that i did something to the cat it would not be pretty and he looks at me with the most hostile eyes. i do not make enough money to truly support myself..i can not find a second job and my current job would not hire full ti ame...i can barely pay my bi wills and feed myself so i only really survive off cheap snacks.. my dad essentially abandoned me because i did not go to college and because of that does not really want to help me i took a small loan from r borrow because i really needed to get by but i only paid back a small portion of it and i have been trying my hardest to get the money..i feel like absolute shit and i am just done.. i have also been sick for the last month or two and i have loss sensation in one side of my foot..and at one point both my feet went numb with random spikes of pain and i was unable to walk.. but i have been scared to see a doctor maybe these are not real issues or anything to be sad about..maybe it is just my mind playing tricks on me..idk i really wish i could find a second or full ti ame job to live on my own..pack back the loan i took..and also try to enjoy myself..it is been so hard the last few years and i just want things to i amprove..i also wish i could afford to see a therapist again	moderate
is there a medication that can make me have motivation to do something? i have never sought help for depression, but i kind of feel like i am racing against the clock at this point. i am currently not working after leaving a dead end job over a year ago. i have a bachelors in biology that i am not using and i graduated from college almost years ago. i do not want to be a doctor and i do not want to do lab work. the problem is i genuinely do not want to do anything. i do not know what career i want and the thought of going back to school to be able to get a job that pays remotely well seems so daunting. i have no confidence in myself and am scared to try anything. i feel so stuck. i have never wanted to take depression meds, but i realize that is probably an unfair stance because i do not know much about them. i do not have health insurance right now, so i do not have a doctor to ask. i am going to be looking to get a job just so start getting insurance and work up from there. just wondering though if anyone has found that medication can increase their motivation for life in general?	moderate

i need advices hello there, i am a yo boy and i would like to have some advices. so, to be short, i hate everything. i hate everything about me. first, i hate my lifestyle. i hate how i spend my days. during weeks, i only wake up to go to school then come back to school and sleep. i am currently in holidays and it is worse because i spend my days in my pyjamas on the couch or in my bed in front of the tv or my phone then go to sleep way too late. i have no friends to hang out with and i do not want to go out alone so i always stay in my house. i have no real interests so i am bored all day and i am annoyed if i have to do anything, my homeworks for example. second, i am ugly. i am fat because i do not do any exercises or sports and also because i principally eat the same junk food everyday. i would like to exercise and eat better but i do not have the motivation to do it. i also have intestine problems so basically when i am in school, i am often scared to crap my pants... speaking of school, i hate each and every single one of my schoolmates there. they are dumb, sexist, homophobic, racist, thisrespectful etc. i think they are suspecting i am gay, so they are starting to provoke me which gives me anxiety. while we are here, i am gay, and i am closeted. that is also something i hate, i can not be myself because i am too scared that someone could find out. that fear causes me to not have any clothes i like just because the style i like may be considered homo by everyone else. for this reason, i am also scared to have piercing, to dye my hair or to wear some make up, which i really want to do. all that said, i hate that i am jealous over people on instagram. i know that it is not real life, but i can not help it. they are way more beautiful than me. their hair, eyebrows, eyes, noses, lips, skins, face shape, clavicles, torsos, legs are just looking way better than mine. i know they are showing the good sides of their lives, but i can not see a good side in mine. i know this is a bit ridiculous, but that is just my life at this point... i am already seeing a therapist but it does not help and i do not want someone to feel sorry for me. anyway, the exercises she told me to do are useless. my parents also do not know that i hate my life like it is, they think it is alright with me. so, what could i do? can someone give me some advices? if possible.. thank you and sorry if they are is mistakes, english is not my pri amary language 	moderate

i feel like i finally know what is wrong with me for the past few years i have not been able to understand why i am such a bad person all the ti ame to people who show nothing but love and support for me. i end up driving everyone away because i am insecure about so many fucking things and i am so good at hiding those insecurities. so good in fact that i never even realized that is why i was getting so upset at little things people would say or do to me. i would just bottle it away and keep a straight face then snap at someone eventually and then they would leave me. but even now that i have found what is been causing it i am alone. i have driven everyone away. i am so alone that it is made me a desperate freak that clings to anyone who shows me sympathy, and then pushes those people out forever. i create my own sadness. i sincerely wish i had the courage to take my own life. i think it about doing it everyday now and i really just want someone to confide in. but i am not going to find that here, or anywhere else. for someone like me, who struggles to speak one full sentence to another human being everyday, people like that do not come often. even if they did i would find a way to fuck it up like i have done countless ti ames in the past. i have never felt so truly alone. completely helpless. beyond help. i just want to be able to pull that trigger, or step off that cliff, or cut that vein open.	moderate

i have hit my breaking point i can not take life anymore i have had so many short ups that give me this sickening false sense of hope and happiness that come absolutly crashing the fuck down and bring me back to reality. i literally made a account just so i could voice myself here and get it out before i fuckin break and finally ki will myself. i always read this shit but never joined cause whatever but now i have realized that my loneliness is so much deeper than i realized. i can not even get a fucking earlier apointment with my therapist when i am in crisis that is how alone i fuckin am. can not even pay someone to talk to me whenever i want i have to wait for it. fuckin goddam emotional prostitute is all a therapist really is cause you know they dont actually fuckin care about your life but i just have no one else to fuckin turn to. just so i can break down and be told itll get better? are you fucking kidding me i am life only goes downhi will from here i only see you once a month cause that is all i can afford how much change are we going to get done in minutes. i realized the other day i dont have any fuckin friends just people i get high with. just people who dont care about my fuckin life and never ever fuckin listen. i have been swept to the trash bin of society to no fault of my own and i just keep fading deeper and deeper into nothing. i have suffered so fuckin much but today, today was the day i finally fell over that fuckin edge i was teetering on for so long cause i decided to take that therapists advice and attempt to form relationships with woman. i should never have listened to her cause i am a short hideous fat fuckin loser with a tiny dick therefore romantic relationships are off the table for me but then i realised deep down inside i wasnt actually dying to have sex or find a girlfriend, i just wanted to actually know what it was like to finally talk to a woman for more than min that wasnt related to me. so i created a tinder and bumble profile and after so long of no matches whatsoever voila low and behold i match with a gorgeous girl with the same music taste as me! i messaged her and somehow someway we talked all day! she gave me her number!!! it was totally incredible for the first ti ame in my life i was actually fuckin happy and i write that sobing my fuckin eyes out because i finally felt true fuckin happiness for the first ti ame since i was a child. i have never felt such a feeling before it was the feeling of cocaine or meth without the energy and only the euphoria but didnt go away and just felt so natural and real instead of artificial and toxic. i was happy for the first ti ame in my life talking to a actual girl not flirting or sexting but so much deeper then that. all i actually wanted to do, talk with a girl whom seemed to like talking to me. after waking up everyday for so long feeling like of the worlds population wants nothing to do to me a si ample conversation about music and sports made me feel like a fuckin human for once. and then out of no where the unthinkable happend... she suggested we go skiing together and shed teach me how to ski!!! you know that feeling of happiness i said i felt before well that felt like chicken shit compared to what i experienced in that moment. that truly was the happiest moment of my life and i was so fi willed with hope for what could be my future, not explicitly one with her but one that had friends. i replied instantly and tried to organize something............ and i have been ghosted for days. i refuse to double text or call her. no person whod actually be intrested wouldn t remember to message back. i have never felt so broken in my fuckin existence no matter how bad the comedown or withdrawal no matter how bad the abuse i have endured no matter how neglected someone has treated me it just si amply doesnt compare to the soul shattering emptiness that has consumed me today. what kind of sathistic fuck does that? why could not i have been si amply rejected? why did she have ask me out to do me such wrong. what joy does it bring her what test is she putting me through? how little must you care about another person to be so cruel. all i wanted to fucking do was for the first ti ame in my life know what it was like to hang out with a woman. fuck the fact i could have held hands for the first ti ame fuck the fact i could have hugged a woman who wasnt related to me for the first ti ame fuck the fact that in some parallel di amension i could have had my first kiss. i just wanted to hang out with a woman for fucking once like all the god dam normal people my age. i dont care about getting laid. do you know what it is like to be and your only sexual experiences in life is being sexually assaulted countless fuckin ti ames. do you know what it is like to be molested as a child and sexual abused by the same family member until your a teenager? do you know what it is like for no one to give a fuck not even therapists because a woman did that to you and your a man. do you know what it is like to go to work every day to be called a f g and gay cause you can not get laid and dont talk to women, to have men years older then you grab your penis and ass to bite you to smack you to rip your pants off and practically strip you naked, to sexualy degrade you daily and nothing to be done about it si amply laughed at. do you know what its like to attempt losing your virginity because your tired of being bullied at work to a drug wh re when sudenly her dad bursts into the room pisses on you and your clothes, gropes you, and then be told that he called dibs on her tonight? do you know what it is like to constantly cut yourself and have your legs covered in self harm scars? do you know what it is like to be a drug addict your only solace getting high your worst fear being without dope? do you know how fucking tramautic my life has been. what the fuck did i do to deserve this. i wish i could just grow some balls and finally ki will myself but i am too much of a coward. i am fucking done with life i can not fucking do this anymore i am so tired and sick i can not fuckin live like this anymore	moderate
why does everyone tell me i am happy? like as if depression is not a lifelong mental i willness i wi will have to deal with from my trauma for the rest of my life? my mom, past therapist s , friends, sisters, and even boyfriend seem to think since i am smiling and saying i am okay i am all better and it makes me feel like i can never tell anyone i think about ki willing myself because if i tell someone i get if you ki will yourself i wi will be so sad and it wi will be unfair to me , so it is just some nice guilt tripping that makes me feel even worse when those suicidal thoughts pop up and i can not do anything i feel like i am just waiting for the day i stop caring about what everyone thinks and become more selfish and finally end it	moderate

i am ready to go. to me, my life has no meaning. i am nothing and am worth nothing. i have love in my heart but can not learn to let others love me. i have pushed some of the greatest people out of my life because i could not see the value they see in me. trust issues, anxiety, depression, paranoia, all have consumed me. i deal with all of it with drugs and alcohol. i have a bleak outlook on the future. i can not see any good coming my way and if i do, i do not deserve it. i am ready to go. i have felt this way since i was or since i was old enough to understand what this feeling is. some people are meant for life, other are not, i am one of those people. i have had a rough up bringing, but who has not? so what excuse do i have? i am just a weaker kind of person. i think about death on the daily but am afraid of the outcome. i do not want leave my family traumatized or burdened. i do not want them to take blame in this. that is just me and who i am, i hope they can understand that. i feel like my self worth is equivalent to a grain of sand. there are so many people in this world, what does one less person mean? i have been trying my best to smile through pain. i have tried my best to be a kind, forgiving, and understanding person. everyone who is known me has described me as the social, outgoing, funny kid. one who care about other before hi amself. but i am at my wits end and can not do it anymore. i tried being who they said i was but i do not know who i am in the end. i love my family with all my heart. but now i can not find a reason to stay anymore. yes, life is beautiful.... but it can being mean and ruthless more often than beautiful. i really have tried to see the good in every little detail, but i guess i did not look hard enough. i guess i am just ranting on because this many be my last thing i write and i do not even have the courage to mention a word to my friends and family. so, thank you reddit. i feel like i have failed everyone. even myself. hopefully this path i chose has better results than the one i am currently on.	moderate

living on my own for the first ti ame best friends boyfriend makes me feel like shit constantly i have been struggling with depression for about years now, and this past year i finally reached a personal goal of moving out on my own for the first ti ame at . my best friend and her boyfriend as well as one other guy are living with me, and that is why i am able to afford to live here. despite it helping me for a while i inevitably started struggling with the usual stuff again after a few months, and that is when her boyfriend really started to show his colors in terms of what he thought of me. her boyfriend is an extremely practical, very numbers kind of guy, and also, according to the way he talks to me, never forgets anything or makes honest mistakes. i do understand that i need to be better about things, remember to do them on ti ame and such, but the way he talks to me makes me almost not want to do them because i feel even less motivation or drive to get the fuck up and do them. it takes all of the very little energy i have and crushes it. someti ames it even happens that i am doing a task and accomplishing something well for once and he messages telling me to do it now and it just undermines my whole feeling good that i am out of bed, doing something and being healthy. he has,in the past,said things to me like the great lindsey manages to mess up again! how do you not remember to do this thing? are you stupid? you forgot to take your laundry out again??? yes in all caps this happens in a group chat that everyone sees. i have told my best friend how i feel and while she says she understands, she obviously sticks up for hi am a bit because she sleeps with hi am, spends every day with hi am, has feelings for hi am, etc. she chalks a lot of it up to his cultural background he is from india and says that he is just like that, but i often feel as if she thismisses the fact that i do not even like being around hi am because i feel he despises me and thinks i am a lazy idiot, despite knowing that i have mental health issues. a lot of the things have been more minor, too. putting mail on the table instead of the mail basket he bought for us. putting either too many or too little thishes in the thishwasher. i sti will do not know which i am guilty of, he is said i do both all the ti ame accidentally nudging the little handle on the bathtub once. idk, maybe i am really a shitty person to live around and be with, but i feel like i have put more effort in the last year than i was before, with having real jobs and paying bi wills and such, but it is sti will a daily struggle to even exist, and i just want to not wake up to someone berating me in all caps.	moderate

just a rant if i had to guess when it all started i would have to say that i probably saw my first signs of depression around . it is just been recently that i started seeing a therapist and she told my parents and i that i have depression. she told my therapist that she wouldn t be surprised if that was true. after she said that i do not know why but i just broke down. it just really hurt me to hear that my mom knew that i had depression and even suspected it but never once tried to help me. it is gotten a lot worst in the last months and school is also been majorly i ampacted. i used to go to the gym, parties, do well in school but these days i can not find the motivation to just get out of bed. earlier today i was going to my room to go to sleep because i did not want to be awake. she saw that and just lost her shit, talking about how useless i am and how i can not even do anything. i could not even argue back because i could not find a reason to. i knew everything she was saying was true. when i laid down she was sti will yelling and i just broke down again. i have been thinking of hanging myself for weeks now but never do it because i keep telling myself i wi will be alright but i do not know anymore. nothings going well in my life, do not know what to do anymore	moderate

depression because of social problems does anyone else get this? i think my depression comes from my social problems. i am a m and i just have a really hard ti ame trying to feel psychologically normal i guess. for example, i struggle every day with my self i amage and overall concept of self. this also is a result of my social problems ever since i was very young years old when i started school i have struggled to feel secure and good about my place among my peers. ever since that ti ame i have always worried about how people saw me, and i have never really been able to feel secure in who i am. i am plagued with social anxiety and i am honestly very very cowardly when it comes to working on it , which i really do not do only in baby steps have i confronted it, but i do not challenging myself regularly. it is like my brain does not want me to try at all, as if being social is the exact opposite of what my brain wants me to be. on top of that, my social ski wills are not that great anyways. it actually perplexes me how much i actively do not understand about socializing. for instance, i never thought about conversational rhythm, but i read about it not to long ago. my problem is i can not i ammediately see or apply these things. learning them is so painfully slow. i literally just tuned in to the rhythm of a short phone call i just made, and it felt so weird and unnatural. it is something i often thought i was picking up on, but i just do not if i do not sit there with my feelings for a second. and then there is the fact that emotional connection with other people feels so wrong. that is why i can not legiti amately get excited for things even if the group crowd is my brain always puts me on the outside of these situations, as if it is actively blocking me from sharing in that moment with people. and you can see how that actually makes me very awkward and sort of vaguely unpleasant to others. i can not make quick positive relationships with people, like with customers at my job for example, because my brain feels so wrong in actuality enjoying a moment with someone. i am also just a needy fuck. despite not really being social, i constantly think of people i used to consider friends and long for them, but i can not reach out. that would be an attempt at emotional connection, which i am bad at, and which is coming from a very needy place. i feel like i would be doing a thisservice to people at worse by trying to be friends with them. everything that comes out of my mouth feels forced because it is. for over a year sincev trying to overcome all this stuff. that is all the energy i have for this. i do not know. shit just sucks. being thisliked sucks and not really ever knowing if i am liked sucks even more. i mean how do you get anywhere in life if nobody likes you in particular?	moderate

should i work on graveyard shift or not? hi, i badly need an advice. short version i do not want to work on graveyard shift, fearing it wi will trigger my depression. i have options . ask for doctor is certificate to work on morning. . submit resignation letter. . face graveyard shift head on and gamble my health and life there. long version since january this year, i have been working on a morning shift am pm . i requested this to my leads because i was already burnt out because i used to work on the busiest mid shift noon pm for years. so far, morning shift is the best i can eat healthy foods on ti ame, sleep hrs, get to do my hobbies after shift. however, i heard that i wi will be transferred to graveyard shift pm pm . it is not yet final, but it has high chances of getting i amplemented because people working on graveyard are now getting sick so we wi will swap. the problem is that i have worked graveyard last , apr may. in a way, it contributed to me getting antidepressants months later on september of that same year. that was my rd ti ame to take antidepressants. st was in , i was in college. nd was in , i was in my previous work. the reason for my depression is not quite clear, too much overprotective parents, very low self esteem, me not talking to people, fucked up sleep, unhealthy diet, my inability to prioritize i amportant tasks, etc. currently, things are working well not totally but at least i have made small effective efforts and i am afraid working on graveyard might trigger my i willness. i did not want to live in constant fear of depression but wouldn t diabetics avoid sugar? wouldn t people with gallstones and high blood pressure avoid fatty foods? why would i not avoid a graveyard shift that wi will fuck up my sleep and other daily routines. i have options. . visit my psychiatrist and request for a medical certificate, which i do not know is something he would issue because there are worst depression cases than me. but i wi will sti will try to talk to hi am later today. . submit a resignation letter. i already submitted a resignation letter last year but i retracted it after all of my leads talked to me worrying because they know i do not have a backup job waiting for me and i have a mortgage with more years of terms. some of them also want me to stay because they saw my potential in our work. but, recently, i bought a laptop which wi will enable me to find an online job that pays better and requires less hours of work. but it is a huge gamble because only heaven knows how fast i can find a job. . face graveyard shift straight to it is face and .a. i wi will be ok and manage to sleep well on dayti ame. .b. i wi will get screwed and be depressed again and be on antidepressants and get well, then decide again what to do with my career when that happens. .c. i wi will get screwed really screwed that no amount of antidepressants can help me and that i wi will eventually you know... cross the line... to the point of no return. ps. i work as part of a devops team, handling critical issues and occasional programming. salary is decent for my needs. i am single and feeds nobody but myself. i have no savings. but when things get worse i can always sell my house, which is on mortgage, yes i can. i can also go home to my parents when things get fucked up but that is not my goal here. 	moderate
i feel like i have no right to be depressed i have friends who care about me. i have family who love me. i just got a job that i wanted. i have been told i am smart, funny and attractive. but for some reason i just can not bring myself to be happy. i wi will be around people and by all accounts i seem like a bubbly, fun person. but then when i am left to my own thoughts feel so unbearably sad all the ti ame. and i do not want to talk about it with anyone because i know i should not feel like this. there are people around me who have it so much worse than me. i think i and others should be focusing on them instead because my sadness does not seem warranted.	moderate
feeling happy and enjoying life for once i was twelve when i noticed something in me change. the way i thought of the world changed. instead of me living on earth, i felt like i was constantly fighting to find my purpose for being on this planet. i felt insignifican not compared to everything. i felt like that annoying side character no likes or asked for. i have felt this way for most of my life. i felt hollow and alone stuck under a cloud of darkness. everything i did or touched was tainted by my negative presence. i pushed away everyone, kept them all at arms thistance. because i felt this constant pressure following me everywhere. i screamed for help. but i felt like no one understood, no one could hear, no one cared. except one. i know her more than i could ever payback. she saw my pain. she felt my pain. she helped me the best she could and for that, i appreciate her more than most people in my life. one day when i was sixteen, i felt my chest tighten. i felt like someone turned off the oxygen switch. i felt the room spin and close in on itself. it was my first anxiety attack. shortly after that, i attended therapy for the first ti ame. i enjoyed it, but my family thought it was a waste soo. i stopped. throughout my life, i have been up and very down. there was a point where i thought about plunging a kitchen knife into myself and just letting myself bleed there on the cold floor. and then there were moments when my brother and i were driving in the car blasting music. it was bliss. but as always the negative tends to overtake the positive. i struggled a lot. with everything. i failed classes and flunked out of nursing school. that was my lowest low. i felt like i failed everyone and like i did not deserve to live or to be cared for. i dedicated myself to work. i found comfort in care for others. i fell in love with nursing again. i finally now have a medication combo that works for me. i found something to dedicate myself to. i have found a purpose, a reason to live, a reason to exist. i am here to say the darkness never truly goes away. i know how cliche and how some of you have heard that ti ame and ti ame again. but, slowly it gets more manageable. be patient. i am right now. and i can say with confidence i do not have my shit together. but i have realized something no one else does either. it is okay, to not be okay. take a deep breath. play devil is advocate, find reasons to live and keep saying them out loud. eventually, you would not have to convince yourself.	moderate
have you felt with that giant dream of dying but know person hopes you do not? i do not want to ki will myself i feel thisgusted by the constant thoughts of needing to hang myself even do my only friend wants me to continue, he hears me out and tries to help but i just can not it is like having two sides of the world hi am who everyone likes as a friend and everyone follows while me i am just a husk. he is been trying but it sounds like that half hearted shit that it wi will get better and we all know it does not. i dont have dreams, hopes, passion or anything i just stick around having to remember how my mom called me useless as y o my sisters telling me it would be better if i was not born or thinking that people most do not go through that and i just dont feel anything anymore and just having to take more just to not let down the first peeson who thought i am valuable at least.	moderate
i feel... off. i do not know if i belong here because i have not been clinically diagnosed. i have been having problems with self harm. every moment i think of ki willing myself, but i can not open up to people. even if i really want to bring up something my stupid fucking psyche tells me that i am supposed to be the dumbass of the group and i end up burying my feelings. of course, to fuck things up further, i bring up my problems in casual conversation. at this point i have told my best friend that i have been planning to commit suicide but my mood has gotten worse. i lash out at people and treat them like shit. i feel like i do not deserve anything and everything i have should be someone else s. i have been failing at school because i want to do the homework but i just do not do it and lie to my parents. they do not see that anything is wrong and they just chalk it up to puberty. people tell me i am feeling sorry for myself and begging for attention and when they say that it hurts because i think they are right. every thought goes back to me hating and wanting to ki will myself. everything good that happens is i ammediately swept away because i think i do not deserve to be there and that i should have died. i feel fucking pathetic. people tell me that i am just choosing to be unhappy and negative, but i do not know what to do anymore. it feels like every thought in my head has shattered and my mind feels like a piece of splintered wood. i just need random anonymous people to talk to who want ask later on.	moderate

getting emotionally blackmailed to marry my cousin sorry its long and thank you for anyone who actually reads this need advice. i am from pakistan and cousin marriages are normal or at least they are not looked down upon. my moms parents told my mom to get me married to my mom is sister is daughter when we were born so both of us grew up knowing we would get married in the future so we never took each other as cousins or brother sister. also i moved to uk when i was and she stayed in pakistan. now when we both are our parents told me they were going to get me engaged and i said no to it but than i got a lot of emotional blackmail for a month from my mom and her side of the family. things that hurt me the most was my mom saying shes going back to pakistan because she does not want my sibling who are under to become anything like me and them saying i used my cousin because she has i amagined her future with only me and i am betraying her and ruining her life. i gave in and said fine to the engagement because i felt like shit and i already have depression and anxiety and since everyone was saying i wi will change my mind afterwards and since i am not dating anyone i agreed but i did not go back home my parents went and actually made a really big deal of it because i am their first born. week after the engagement and telling myself that this is a good thing, it wi will work out, i wi will be happy i am back to panic mode and feeling trapped. now here is the thing she is very nice, way better looking than me but i am sti will not attracted to her and i am not talking about looks i am just talking personality wise she wants to be the traditional housewife and i just want a friend since i literally felt alone my whole life also i can not get over the fact that she is my cousin even though its normal in my family her parents are first cousins and mine are third cousins so if i do get married i wi will not have kids that is for sure i wi will adopt or go a different route and that is an issue as well since she wants kids and thinks nothing wi will happen to our kids now i understand that kids could be perfectly healthy but if they are not i wi will hate myself forever so i wi will never take that chance since we are cousins. i just need advice and opinions on this situation because i love my parents and i know they love me and its not my cousins fault either because to her cousin marriage is normal and she grew up thinking she wi will marry me and she did not date anyone else and has told me she wi will not marry anyone else if not me and wi will stay single for the rest of her life which is making me think that i am ruining her life which is driving me insane to point where i am thinking of ways to end my life to avoid upsetting my parents, families back home and my cousin and just escaping all this bs. whoever read this thank you so much.	moderate

i do not even know what happened literally i was out with a friend and their friends and they were having a jam session playing guitar and everything and suddenly everything seemed so thistant. my chest got really tight and the world felt like it was shrinking around me. my breathe started getting short and i had to leave i ammediately. she asked if i was okay and i could not respond. i finally got some words out and she tried to kiss me goodbye but i just could not stand sti will. i basically ran to the other side of my car and wished her a good night and i left. i texted her and apologized and she seems to understand but i just feel so gross. i was probably on the verge of a panic attack but i do not know what triggered it	moderate
vent. i am hispanic yet people think i am asian. i am getting annoyed over this. it never bothered me until a few years ago. everyone thinks i am asian nothing wrong against being asian but it is annoying how people of my own kind talk crap in spanish . i am short so no one takes me seriously, if i do anything it is overcompensating. i have been fucked over many ti ames and because i am short i get ignored. half the ti ame i want to hurt people but i can not because again i am compensating. yet if i try to do anything, i pretty much end up being chaptered out. i look young so everyone thinks i am a child. i have lost my potential in life because indirectly i feel like i am invisible or like i am a kid. it drove me to my li amits and tbh i know i have a permanent problem. ohh i also am an addict so anything i try i get hooked on easily. i feel i ammature to even other people and i am never hispanic enough. my dad felt the same but he died years ago. idk. my hope and dreams are over so i am just idk. idk. i am a permanent problem that needs a permanent solution. no matter what i can not tell anyone that without being sent to the looney bin. everyone says i am so stiff and robotic. every day i search on how to be normal or the next drug to finally be myself again but i have had no luck. i have been taking phenibut but now i take it because i am avoiding withdrawal symptom. i have been dedicated to the gym yet i get thiscouraged when i hit my pr goals and it is sti will nothing. i am not the biggest and i get thiscouraged by ig. everyone is moving on, i am sti will at home working jobs because i can not afford to live on my own within my budget. idk there is nothing i can do.	moderate

i do not expect anyone to read this i just have to get my emotions and thoughts out i feel like i am under so much pressure, and i am so alone. every day is intense anxiety from the moment i am conscious in the morning. i am a manager and i have to interact with my employees all day. i can not even look them in the eye, but i would do and try to do anything i can for them to make sure they are happy and enjoying their work. i do not think the majority actually respect me though and see me for the worthless anxious fuck i am. the pressure i am under from work is insane. we re growing quick and it is building quick and there is more and more coming each day and i am expected to handle it all and more. i go home and take benzos so i do not have to think about the day. i pound my brain with ambien as i have the last couple years. i just want someone to share my life with, but who would want to be with this miserable mess anyways. i watch my friends getting married and having kids and i want the same so much, but i do not think i deserve it nor ever wi will deserve something that great. i miss affection. just holding someone and feeling loved. now i am passed out in bed by pm every night because i would rather be asleep and not thinking than awake, alone, and anxious.	moderate
i am at my lowest point i feel as if i have been at a steady decline for a long ti ame now, but i think that right now i have hit true rock bottom. about a week ago i had a seizure out of nowhere which almost ki willed me, my mother had to resuscitate me on the ground she is a nurse and i was taken to the er. there is a possibility i might have epilepsy. i had been really sick for about a week when it happened so it could have resulted from a really bad fever, but according to my mom there is a shot that i might have epilepsy, which has been like crushing me. it horrifies me that it would get in the way of things that thistract me make me happy. it is all i have been able to think about. i have been severely depressed for about years now, and that just pushed it even deeper. every single day for the last week i have had suicidal thoughts. i found myself wishing that the seizure had ki willed me and my mother had not saved me. i just feel worthless, and completely blank if that makes any sense. i feel if i had i ammediate access to a firearm i would be dead by now. i genuinely did not think it could get worse, but over the course of a week i have gotten more suicidal than i have ever been. i want to be a little kid again. back when i was curious about the world and eager to learn things, before i was on any drugs, when i loved both my parents and i had a really solid friend group and i did not have a care in the world. i do not know what to do with myself.	moderate
why am i so weak? today someone told me in passing that i need to have more self thiscipline. then i started crying. the other day someone told me they did not want to be my friend, and i started crying. i am failing two classes in school and i am crying right now because of it. somebody blocked me yesterday and i fucking started crying. my dog does not like me enough and someti ames i cry because of that. when people do not respond to my texts i start crying. why am i so easily reduced to tears? why do i throw tantrums about such little things? why am i so thisgusting?	moderate
something has to change to me, life feels like the line from alice in wonderland here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. and if you wish to go anywhere, you must run twice as fast as that. i feel like i am either running as fast as i can and getting nowhere, and someti ames even trying to run twice as fast to make things better, then inevitably when it becomes to much i trip and set myself back. i am either putting in the effort, or crumbling because i no longer can. rinse and repeat. i have almost nothing stressful in my life and plenty of good things going for me. i am married to a loving and supportive man, we do not have any children yet, i only work short shifts twice a week at a job that is not stressful in a positive environment, i have great friends and family... the list of positives goes on. however, i have had some serious challenges in recent years, and i feel like i am emotionally drained from them even though they are in the past, and it is keeping me from enjoying my life now and making things better. i find myself unable to keep up with my mini amal load without periodic meltdowns. i feel like i am running on an empty gas tank, and anyti ame something unpleasant happens i am unable to cope. some examples of the things that trigger my meltdowns are having to visit with friends and family when i am not feeling up to it which is most ti ames we plan anything together , minor frustrations that build up and cause me to blow, needing to eat when i have not done groceries or cleaned the kitchen, or pretty much anything that makes me frustrated or requires energy beyond what i feel i have at the moment. i do not know how i can make things any easier for myself, or why i can not just cope with the bad and enjoy the good things. as soon as something triggers me i am reminded of whatever the deeper issue at play is, how they are all connected and my fault, and i spiral out of control. i feel like i am ruining my husband is life and wasting mine, but i do not know how to stop. part of me wants to reduce my stress by taking a step back from everything and everyone, but it can not get much easier. i try to stop the spiral before it gets too bad, and someti ames i am able to do so but too often i can not, and the only thing that seems to make me successful in doing so is when things do not continue to go wrong, which i have no control over. any advice you have to help me break this pattern would be so helpful. also, any advice for how to contain my reaction so that i do not make things awful for my husband would be helpful as well. thanks guys.	moderate

stuck in the endless ocean ever since i can remember i have felt like i was just stuck feeling heavy and unable to breathe, i have tried to end this existence before. it is not just feeling lost or stuck though, i just want everything to stop, all the neurotic thoughts, the visual and auditory hallucinations, the empty pit. my original plan was to ki will myself when i have achieved my goal which was to payback my mother for everything she is done. this post seems quite dire, so i wi will try to end on a more upbeat positive note i finally met someone who i do not feel alone around, so if you are on the edge just remember that you would not always be alone someone wi will come along and help ground you.	moderate
continue progress of last post part day read last post for context ok so i got up and got dressed and did my makeup agian tonight i wore it for minutes but i see a progress. like i said in my recent post i saw my beautiful self agian. i am thinking i wi will try to do this every night for a while get fully ready and then get un ready. it gives me a reminder i am beautiful and alive as well as sti will me. now trust me i know i would not always want to get up to do this, i did not want to today... but i did and i feel ever so slightly better. a small progress... this is hard for me to do as my anxiety and depression has become crippling and i never leave the house or get dressed. i even wore my old cloths which is hard because i have developed sensory issues i believe. but the point of all of this is that even tho it was for five minutes i felt like myself agian, i felt alive. i realize that i can not die because there is this beautiful girl that i am that wants to live. i really think you should try this or something si amilar get up for a short ti ame or just stay in bed... and do something that the non depressed you would want to do. now it is ok if it ends negative and you have a breakdown. that has happened to me previously but in my experience those breakdown just showed me even more that i have emotions and i am alive. just continue trying and then one day you wi will look at your hobby or yourself and say wow i am me it would be amazing to have someone to go through this journey with i wi will try and update posts on the days that i do this... even if it ends not so great. another hard day but another day i tried. have an amazing day and know i love you all reddit user	moderate

i just do not do anything i have depression and anxiety for so long ti ame that i forgot when it all started but it doesnt matter. i take medications for so long ti ame that i almost do not know how to live without them. i push everyone away and finally i have no friends, no one to talk to about shit. my life? i do not have one. i hardly finished school and went to college. i thought i was getting better but then i fought with my parents and left my house and was so scared of the world and having so many panic attacks because i literally had no money and was starving that i had to make peace with them and get back. now i live like a ghost. no, i do not live, i si amply exist. i am trying to get back to college now. but i see people talking about their days and i am like how? how do you do stuff? i spend the entire day looking at shit on the internet always checking the clock to see if the ti ame is passing. i have it, i have to see that the ti ame is passing. one day less i say to myself. i feel like i am parasite in my own life. i barely leave my house. i almost feel like i am so far away from the real world that wi will never be able to fall in love or make real conections and create relationships with people. i si amply do not do anything. and i do not know where to start. or maybe i do know where to start, but i do not know how to do it. someti ames i look at my therapist dying inside like asking for her to tell me what to do. my parents and doctors say that i have to move. get out of inercia because i am thinking too much about everything and it ll only make my depression and anxiety get worse and that i have to face it, eventhough the anxiety is kicking me. but i have no strengh to do any. i am not living, i am just ki willing ti ame. someti ames i feel like i do not exist, i look at myself in the mirror and i hate everything i see and how i let myself get so fat and ugly. but i just do not do anything. i tried to go to the gym but i feel like i do not have energy to do anything. actually, i am tired. i am tired of everything. i fantazie about ki willing myself almost every day. i even create the narrative where i watch my entire funeral and people crying. i wish i could ki will myself, but i do not have the gutts to do it. so i do not die, but i si amply do not live. i feel so lonely and hopeless. i do not see any point in life. i just... wish i could enjoy things again and have a porpouse and if i could just do anything, the basic of human being. i hate myself so much. i just felt like venting. i am sorry for the big useless text.	moderate
i am depressed and need someone to talk to hey, my name is jay m . i kind of have a situation... i live with my mom f and sister and dad. my mom has been acting weird lately since she got her new job a few years ago. she is just cold and thistant and takes her anger out on me all the ti ame. i think someti ames she literally searches for reasons to mad at me. she does the same thing to my dad. my younger sister f is a spoiled brat and is the golden child . mom treats her super nice and buys her anything she wants and she treats me like absolute shit. i just kind of stay away from her. my dad though m is the nicest person in the world. when he is off we always go and hang out and play pick up at the basketball court. he understands when my mom is acting like a bitch and is a really nice guy. i feel like he is one off the only people in the world that i can be myself around. he says that i am the only reason he didint leave my mom because he didint want to abandon me. the problem is my dad is barely ever off from work. he works from pm to am most days and since i leave the house to go to school i barely see hi am. he also works overti ame alot as well. this means that when i am home i have to deal with my brat sister and my insane mom. i mostly just go in my room and close the door and draw or watch basketball games on my phone. i only have or close friends but i can not hang out with them alot because my mom does not allow it. i feel so alone and depressed and empty. why does my mom act like this? why does my sister act like this. i just feel really depressed and i need someone to talk to.	moderate

does the sedating effects of drugs like amitriptyline become more tolerable over ti ame? was prescribed low dose amitriptyline for sleep issues and anxiety. however, the sedation lingers into the next day and it seems to i ampair my cognitive ability, which is not much better than just not being able to sleep. does this lessen overti ame? i dropped doxepin and mirtazapine because it left me completely out of it and it never got much better.	moderate
it is okay i have been trying desperately to find a reason, an answer to how i got here. i grew up with a supportive family, the ability to buy whatever i want, a few friends, nothing was wrong . so i blamed myself that i got here. but i saw this comment creds to fellow reditter depression does not thiscri aminate so well written. we all have gotten here for different reasons, whether it was genetically passed down, chemical i ambalance or just life being an asshole. but we are here together, and we are here to win this fight. hope we can make this out together 	moderate
i feel like i am not even a real person my whole life is just work, go home, and watch youtube until its am and i have to go to sleep. i dont post any comments online, i have no public social media accounts, and i dont have any friends at work, it feels like i am just a ghost. i didnt have any friends in school either until i was in highschool and just got caught up with guys who wanted me to do funny, crazy shit all the ti ame. which i think friend is a lose term for them, since i havent even seen their faces in years since they always pretend like they have shit to do all the ti ame to avoid me. ive never really had any romantic relationships either. it used to hurt that i was so undesirable, but now i dont know what to feel. i just feel so confused i dont understand what is so repulsive about me. i am definitely below average, but not hideous. i get the advice to be confident but i have nothing to be confident about i am not smart, i am not good looking, not talented, i am not athletic, i am socially awkward, i am a lazy piece of shit, and to top it all off i am a borderline cripple because of my stabbing back pain and migraine thisorder. if i died tomorrow nothing would change, there would maybe be one or two people sad about it for a week and after that i would just thisappear from memory. its getting harder and harder to find a reason to live and i had attempted suicide before and i wish i had finished the job when i actually had to spine to try. at this point i just want to curl in a ball and rot to death.	moderate

is depression good in a way that it basically makes you reevaluate things and see things a lot clearer? i just think depressed people are more realistic and see things a lot clearer, basically i am in this stage of reevaluating my life, but it is lead me to this bad conclusion. i just think i need to move on from all this and start new.	moderate

depression took one of my only pleasures. i used to masturbate, because it was the only thing that made me feel ok. it made me feel a small bit of happy, just a break from being so sad all the fucking ti ame. i have been on prozac for a while, just getting higher and higher doses. it took away my libido. i never get horny enough to do it, and even if i try it never works. it was one of the only things i could always rely on. i am so done. i just want to cut and cry	moderate

my depression and attempts rant i have been dealing with depression for about years now. i was suicidal for the first years and there were nights where i had a gauge in my mouth for hours. but my depression i think results from not meeting my parents standards, but yet the reason i never pulled the trigger was because over the pain that it would bring my mom. i had talked to my dad about suicide and the people he knew who had committed suicide and he said that he would never go to someone who committed suicide funeral. i have documented most of my episodes and what is help me the most is talking to friends who wi will listen even if they dont understand. i guess this post is to get advice from people in my same boat and also tell people that no matter what there are more people who care about you than you think.	moderate

i do not want to be better for the past couple of years i have honestly been spiraling deeper into this shit. i do not even know how to describe it tbh. i do not even know if it is depression or some weird combination of fucked up thoughts and apathy, but i just do not care anymore about anything and what is even worse is i do not even feel like it is an issue. i am by no means a loser, in the traditional sense, i have friends at school, all the typical jocks and party people. you probably know the type the ones who have their special group of cool kids they talk to and no one else, i play the typical jock sports like lacrosse, but i did not always used to be like this and my life just feels like a lie. it is like i put a mask on as soon as i step into school and it is just that, a mask, i do not feel like myself at all and it is all just a facade i put on to make life just barely bearable. all my friends invite me to their functions and parties and all that bullshit but i just do not even feel like leaving the house i just sit around doing random stuff until i can go to my room, pass out, and repeat it all over again. if it was not for the projects i have been working on in my own ti ame i probably wouldn t even be alive rn and at this point they are basically the only things keeping me going. i just want to be like everyone else. how do people enjoy life? i just do not understand how people go to school talking to the same people about the same stupid shit day in and day out and feel like they are living life to the fullest. the problem is i do not even know what living life to the fullest means, does it mean being popular, talking to all the hot girls, going to all the cool kid parties. or does it mean staying locked in and getting good grades. or does it mean being creative and building cool new stuff. i just need to get my shit together somehow. rant over.	moderate

my relationship crumbled, lost my job. i see no future. hello, whoever reads this. i have struggled with depression for a really long ti ame. i fell deeply into depression while i was engaged to my ex fiance. i had numerous events where i wanted so bad to take my life and just be done with it all. anyways i broke up with my ex fiance because in the last few years of our relationship she stopped caring about me. it ended up being long thistance and she made no effort to ever see me. i ended it and then had about and a half years of being alone. my self worth has always been low and i have always felt that everyone around me is better. throughout life i have never had anyone actually interested in me or wi willing to give me a shot both in my career and in personal relationships. anyways as of today, two major things have happened i broke up with my ex. after being without anyone for so long i basically jumped into the arms of the first girl who gave me attention. i threw everything at her, unloaded my heart, ti ame, and money for her. i wanted nothing else in the world but to be with her. however, after months all the red flags became clear and i was able to see the bad that i blocked from my mind. she was narcissistic and gas lighted me constantly. she would abuse me mentally and physically all the ti ame, knowing full well that i would roll over. a few ti ames after she verbally berated me i tried to run and block her out of my life...but i would end up stumbling back to her. yesterday was one of those ti ames. every single ti ame i would crawl back she would tell me how pathetic i was and how much more i would have to work on i amproving my love to win her over. even if it involved competing with other men. i ignored all of this and i basically submitted to her. well.... until today. i was joking around with her saying i would try more and buy her chocolates and so forth. she then out of the blue tells me that she wants to fight my family because they do not approve of her and that she wi will probably end up in jail... i was taken back by that statement, she then tells me that she believes i would not like her that much after she murders my mom. me um what? her yup, i want to ki will her . i told her to stay the f away and never contact me again. i deleted everything and blocked her completely. right now i am shaking. how can i fall into love with someone so twisted? did i have that low of self esteem that i fell into a trap of abuse? my therapist has told me that i continue with the abuse cycle constantly because i just seek love. how messed up am i that i would even choose someone that would think it is okay or funny to mention ki willing my own mom? how did i miss those warning signs? what is wrong with me? how did enable this to happen? if i had one ex who wanted nothing to do with me, no one for so long, and then a crazy psycho.... what do i expect next? i honestly just wanted some to be interested in me and to give love back. now to my next dilemma. i went on trips for this girl and flew everywhere to her. she demanded me to come to her because if i did not it was not love. i ended up losing my job, my visa expired. i have to leave the country usa . my entire family is in the states. i have no one back in my home country, i have been applying since december for jobs in canada and have only gotten three interviews but have not gotten anything else. i have experience in my field, i have a degree, but nothing is happening. i feel the floor dropped out from under me. my family is in the same city as me, i do not make friends easily, i fear that once i am alone without a job i might do something. i just do not see a future anymore. i have basically hit rock bottom.	moderate
everyone on here ignores me most of the ti ame but i just really need help. i am going back to uni in a few days then i am going camping after being back for days. i am just insanely stressed. the bad feelings always creep back in when i am intensely stressed like this. i do not know what to do anymore.	moderate
i wish i could know for sure if my friends actually cared about me. my mom for the years i have been alive has always been tearing me down and i do not have any self confidence. only within the past two years have i been able to talk to anyone about how i feel and what i am going through. but at the same ti ame i feel like i deserve to be like this, that i am a horrible person that does not deserve to feel happy. i am constantly paranoid that my closest friends actually hate me and i feel like i forced all of my problems onto them and now they have to deal with my shit. they never asked for it. i was just too selfish to realize that it was wrong to turn to them. every day i hope that maybe they wi will text me and ask me if i am ok instead of me having to tell them that i feel worthless at pm. but nope. they wi will never text first. i am pretty sure they actively ignore the messages i send them, and i can not blame them. why would you want to help someone that ignores all the advice and support you have constantly given? why would you want to help someone that is actively refusing to get better because they are scared of change?	moderate
so i have applied for long term thisability because i honestly do not know if i wi will ever be mentally well enough to work again i was at my therapy session earlier this week and the conversation causally turned to work and future employment. now i am on leave right now because i was getting major panic attacks at work and it was not manageable. i would been mostly fine since going on leave but even just talking about returning to work not even my current job necessarily but any work and i am getting chest pains that is a major indicator that i am having a panic attack. my short thisability is running out and i am trying to get my work leave extended as well. i might just all out quit the place. i do not know. it is not like the job is any good or pays that much. but that being said, even though i never intended to return to that job i wanted to work again and now it seems that i might not be able to. so now my only option is to be a social pariah and leech on society because i can not get my shit together enough to earn a living like a normal person. it feels like yet another thing that i have failed at. i am officially a non functioning human being that costs society more than i am worth.	moderate
i decided to stop looking for love and now i can not get over the past mistakes i made pursuing it. how can i forgive myself? f my ex boyfriend and i broke up nearly a year ago and since the breakup i realized that i have never had a healthy relationship or courtship. before hi am i was single for years and my standards got lower. he was emotionally abusive, financially draining, and a slob. i remember telling myself that he had committed unlike other men so his behavior was the best i could hope for. my only love interest since was my roommate, he played mind games and wasted my ti ame. i realized with this most recent thisappointment that i am not very good at love. i have never had someone i like feel the same way and treat me well. i am not giving up but i have given up pursuing love, it is been a waste of my ti ame like religion. i am mildly depressed about this. i am having flashbacks of my ex boyfriend doing really mean or inconsiderate things daily. i get angry with myself all over again i feel like i have not come far with how i allowed my most recent crush to treat me either and it is making me mad at myself. i do not know how to forgive myself or have compassion. i also live with my former crush so it is been hard getting over hi am. there is a pattern in my life where i can not get love or the guy only wants me after he is mistreated me a mi willion ti ames and i have moved on. i know that i am a great person worthy of love but i can not help but feel that something is wrong with me for failing to have things be mutual. it makes me ? my intelligence and attractiveness too. how can i forgive myself for dating my ex and for liking my former crush? i told myself today that even if i could date my former crush i wouldn t because he is thisrespectful and i deserve a guy who treats me right. how can i belive that maybe someday someone i like wi will treat me well?	moderate

i need help but am too adamant about it. how do you find the fucks to reach out? yeah, i thought about it and i need help, whether i am just fatigued from normal life stuff or may be lowkey depressed. i am probably overeating. i am isolating myself more and more i always wear headphones so i can avoid saying hi or small talk with ppl i know some ppl have noticed my isolating more by joking about it. also, today, it was one of my dormmate is bday today i am in college rn and i said happy birthday with my headphones in so i can gtfo after saying hb and heard the comment along the lines of he said something, pretty much highlighting how i am more isolate i am binge listening if that is a thing to emo music, which i do normally listen to, but usually in the background without being too emotionally invested granted i am not suicidal and do not want to self harm just me ranting spi willing things out after this point, ao yeah, if you want to read, go for it. it is just a heads up in case you re short on ti ame or smth i have been just a bit down for awhile. idk if it is bc the fact that a small group of my dormmates have been treating me like shit many of the other dormmates are great , but are often in the common room. as a result, i have resorted to isolation as a means to avoid then including me using headphones to fake not hearing them. sadly, this has caused me to apply this faking not hearing and isolation to everyone in the common room. however, i do say hi to most of my few acquaintance i know outside my dorm. idk, what to do. i want to be able to recomnect with the few chi will ppl who are in the common room, but dont want to deal with the assholes out there. i can not stand up for myself, bc the assholes have in a sense gained credibility in the commonroom, as they have been out there more and have therefore been able to naturally build trust. as a result, if i do stand up for myself, they can just spreat lies about me and shit talk me more, which wi will cost me the few ppl i am chi will with in the common room. as of the beef i have with those ppl who i am trying to stay away from, these people have taken shit from me without returning them and have been shit talking me like saying , what are you doing here? you shouldnt be here in the dorms i live in and shit like that. they have pretty much stopped after going into heavy isolation and seemed to have been nicer by trying to say hi. the thing is that i can not trust them bc it is a pattern of behavior for them to act nice, then go back to being shit after some mild isolation ive done periodic and mild isolation before . so yeah, bigsad. i sti will have hobbies that i enjoy though and have been i amroving in those hobbies tho, so that is something i have going for me at least d. my grades are not too good tho, and my concentration when it comes to studying is shit tho. the lack of concentration is something i am lowkey concerned about too, because i zone out alot. the few ppl i have talked to also said that their concention is shit too in their classes too, so idk.	moderate

i just feel empty, and lost, and lonely without nobody to turn to. i have hit an all ti ame low in the past months now, all my life i have dealt with depression and anxiety, never have i been as suicidal, as confused, and lost as i have been these past couple of months. i feel so empty half of the ti ame, its like i feel sad, angry, hurt, lonely, and just all around fucked up, but its so hard to cry or let put any of those emotions so i just sit there with this wandering feeling, like i am searching for something, i am longing for something but i do not know where to go, i have nobody to talk to, i just basically lost this friend i had, she is also an ex but we sti will have been cool with each other up until last night when we had a thisagreement and now she is said she is done talking to me despite me telling her how much she means to me and how she is the only one true close person i got in my life right now. so its just to a point where i am feeling sooooo much, and i have nothing to help, no one cares to talk to me, everyone leaves me in the dark without a hint of consideration. i try talking to my mom about stuff i go through but its like i am talking to nobody because she doesnt give any advice or words of encouragement half the ti ame, she doesnt know how to approach me, i tried talking to her about me cutting or trying to at least, and she literally agreed that physical pain helps with mental stuff bbecause she remembers burning a tattoo off her skin and the pain of it helped clear her thoughts, i would of thought she would be concerned, but nope not really, she always seems more concerned and thistraught over my grown sum year old meth addicted sister. it just hurts to know i dont really have anybody. i go through everyday feeling completely alone, like nobody likes me or cares about me enough to just give me the ti ame of day, i have lost interests in things i used to love, almost nothing i do now can help me feel a sense of relief, a sense of happiness and joy, talking to my ex helped bbecause we laugh and joke around and have a connection.... but it seems like that is over with now, i got nobody.	moderate
how do you know if you re being manipulated? my bf is always downplaying my depression. i forgot to take my pi will yesterday so i feel like i am going crazy today. i want to ki will myself so bad because i am just done with everything. i told hi am how i feel and that i just need cuddles amp attention but he told me i do not deserve affection because i made hi am mad earlier. my dog peed on my couch so i grabbed hi am and ran outside on the balcony rd fl apartment building . i forgot i was topless so he yells and me to get back in amp now he is pissed. i did not even notice my boobs were out amp it is not like anyone can see me on the rd floor anyway. every ti ame we argue he always makes it to be my fault and ignores me until he feels better . i constantly ask for more affection or for hi am to be nicer to me but he refuses because i do not take his feelings seriously either his feelings or being pissed that i accidentally ran outside topless . my current bf is reminding me so much of my ex abusive bf lately amp it scares the hell out of me. i can not tell if he is really getting controlling amp manipulative or if i am just seeing things wrong because of my past. i feel like i am going insane. please help me. i feel like i need to try to ki will myself to get the affection i want.	moderate
finally shot my shot with this pretty girl i have been crushing on obviously i missed otherwise i wouldn t be posting this. i am so fucking pissed and sad asf. i felt like i done everything right and i felt like she would at least text me back but she left me on read but saved my message. snapchat i feel like i probably do come off as a si amp but if she would actually give me a chance then i just know she wouldn t regret it. i really do not know how to express myself that well, through social media anyways. and that is probably the real reason she did not text back. she probably thought i was kinda weird too but i was not trying to be if that makes sense i am just shy asf. did not really know how to approach her and it took me sooooooo long to actually send her the long ass text. i wanted me make sure that i did not fuck it up but apparently i sti will did. i am just tired of being alone	moderate

i feel like i do not have the right to feel depress and is waiting ti will i am able to have a job and get out of my house. i feel like heck today because i hurt someone whom i loved the most my mom and somethings happen when i remembered that i have no rights and is basically not considered human in this house. i can not be tired, if i am tired and is upset, i wi will get yelled at, i need to have all a is in my grade and even if i got an a, they wi will be asking for a . my sister told me she have it much worse and she is not even depressed yet so why am i depressed? i never feel like i am worth anything, everyone hates me and wanted me to die so why can not i? because i am a coward, i am too scared to hurt myself, because it hurts duh and someti ame i hope that i could cut myself deeper and begone from this horrible place, but i love my mom and grandma and i am scared of how they wi will reacted. i never feel worth it, i feel like my life could have been someone else is because my mom have abortions before and i wish that i was one of them but here i am. am i the only one feeling like this?	moderate
this weird thing i do to help i watch those videos on youtube where they gather a group of people who have had friends family that have committed suicide. i watch the videos to hear them talk about how personally hard and difficult it has been since the person they cared about and loved committed suicide. i then picture my own family in their shoes, like literally i amagining my family in the video. i picture that it is my own mom getting interviewed, i picture how broken and sad she would be. how destroyed and heartbroken she would feel or any member of my family would feel. that is why i watch those videos, to force myself to be reminded that suicide effects more than just one person. i could never put the people i care most about through that, i hope. it is a constant cycle i go through of having those thoughts, wanting all the pain to stop. then, after awhile, realizing all that it would accomplish would just be me putting all that pain onto other people i love and care about and understanding that is literally the last thing i would ever want to put them through. i am not really sure how to end this post. i never plan on making these with the intent on people actually reading them, they are more for just myself kinda, i do not feel comfortable talking about this with anyone but i sti will need to get my thoughts out of my head somehow or i wi will go crazy, so this is what that is used for. basically me just screaming into an empty void, venting my problems away. if for some reason someone is reading this, please do not worry about me, so many other people have it so much worse in life than me. so please do not, i wi will be fine. thanks.	moderate
trying to find happiness i got out of an abusive marriage about six months ago. at first i felt great because i no longer had to deal with hi am and the stress that came with it. but now the stress of being alone is crushing me. not only financially but mentally and i no longer feel like the happy bubbly person i used to be. i feel like a shell and i can not seem to find anything that makes me feel better. all my friends checked on me at first asking me how i was doing, but since i am sti will sad it seems like they have reached their li amit on listening and hanging out with me because i am not happy anymore. everyone is moving on. i took spaces back. i tried to make new friends and connect with old one but people either flake on me or just ghost me completely. i am only , but i feel like i am tired of trying, tired of waking up everyday. i do not want to be a burden on people anymore. i spent years telling my husband who had anxiety and severe depression how much life was worth living but i honestly stopped believing myself in the past few years a few friends have committed suicide. while i was heartbroken i felt so guilty because i envied them that they were done and free from this sad and painful life. if i did the same it would absolutely crush the people in my life. it devastates me that i have to keep living just to not hurt other people. i realize i am young and in shape, and people seem to really love me, or at least the persona i project. nobody wants the real me.. not even my husband did. i can not talk to anyone about what i feel, i am truly alone.	moderate

how do i stop crying and being depressed over this? so i have known this guy going on two years. when we hung out we usually drove around and talked or just listened to music. we did have oral sex occasionally. a couple days ago he offered to take me out for dinner. i did not want to go but i decided to anyway. when we got to the restaurant i told hi am i did not want anything to eat and i basically just sat there and watched hi am eat while i drank soda and played on my phone. i do not like eating in front of people or going inside restaurants to eat which is why i did not eat. plus i just was not in the mood to hangout and wanted to go home. earlier today i went to his house. we just hung out for a little bit. then i ended up giving hi am a blowjob. he pulled my pants and undies off and went down on me for a couple minutes. in the middle of it my phone started ringing and i told hi am it felt great but i have to answer the phone so i got up to answer it. he was like do you have to answer it now? can not you wait until we are done? i told hi am i had to leave and got dressed. when i said bye to hi am i just gave hi am a quick hug and he leaned down to kiss me but i walked away. we usually kiss when greeting and saying goodbye to each other. i really like hi am a lot but i just feel like i ruined everything. i have been sad and crying ever since i got home. we are both in our late twenties. what should i do? should i go over to his house and make out with hi am? tl dr treated a guy i like poorly and i want to make it up to hi am	moderate

everything costs something i realised something the other day that i thought might make sense to other depressed people. what mentally and physically healthy people do not understand, is that everything, absolutely everything, costs something. they say it is easy. it should be si ample. you get up in the morning, take a shower, brush your teeth and go to work. but what they do not realise is that these things they find so easy? that is because they have an advantage we do not. they have energy. when you re depressed, miniscule things that you wouldn t even think to attribute a cost to, are huge. it might only take a very small amount of energy for regular people to do these things, but some days, it costs me all of my energy to take a shower or complete an assignment. and then there is money. they all make it sound so si ample. go to therapy, or get a prescription for antidepressants. but what if i can not afford therapy? then find a subsithised support service they wi will say. there is always options, for normal people. but what if the only way i could see a cheap therapist is if i can financially, emotionally and physically afford to travel an hour there and an hour back by public transport? there is always a cost. it may sound like excuses to normal people, but when you re literally crippled by your mental i willness, there is really not a lot of options. it is not just a low mood . my mental i willness has cost me everything, and it makes me bargain every day. i have to choose between changing my sheets and going to school because i can not energetically afford to do both. i can not negotiate with my brain like a bank. i can not get what i want here. asking your brain to regulate ita chemicals when you re i will is like asking a bank for a mortgage when you have no income. there is a price, that i can not afford to pay. and people just do not understand that.	moderate

tl dr this is a passage i have wrote in my notes. i have been adding and adding to it cause i just do not know what else to do anymore... my stress level have been through the roof this past month and i am not in a good fucking place. right now i am needing to focus on shit in my life that definitely needs some i amprovement. everyday i am fucking waking up and i feel like i am drowning in my own pit of self sorrow and self demise. shit that should be making my life better turns it into this fire ball from hell trying to burn me alive. i try and try again to make the feeling subside and look for a better fucking light but god damn if that light does not di am then fade away at the end of the god damn day due to something i have no fucking control over. when you guys ask me what is going on i want to talk about it damnit. i want to scream, yell, and shout about it but all i can fucking say is i am fine, or i am good, or i am alright. i sit there some days and wonder to my self if i should walk away or keep trying harder. i know my depression has gotten worse due to me losing weight. my eating habits have changed. i am sleeping way more then usual and waking up with sti will no energy. when people ask what happen what hurt you. my own fucking expectations did. i thrive to be this great person and to be great at all these things but at the end of the day i am none of the things i set out to be. i am getting worse and no one knows it. everyday i have to put on this fake smile while heading to work or at the very sli am ti ames that i hang out with friends because it is always an endless excuse of there too busy or already doing something else. i am too afraid to ask for help. i feel like as a man it is frowned apon to ask for help and i do not know what to do.. i go from work to home. sleep for hours because at least when i am asleep i can not feel the sadness and burn that is enveloping me on a day to day basis. i have also been non stop drinking on weekends to just feel something.. a buzz and a hangover is better then nothing at all right?	moderate
this wi will be deleted when i wake up. i just need to vent. i have been getting better for the past years. that was a lie. i am the happiest i have ever been right now. i do not need a therapist, i am fine, trust me. i often go on about how i hate liars, how they often wi will get my hopes up for something just to find out that it was not true. you re attractive, i am sure you ll find someone who wi will treat you right. if you prayed more and were closer to god you wouldn t feel this way. prayer and my beliefs are the only reason i am sti will alive, but it does not change the fact that i have no wi will to live at all. i do not blame god for what goes through my head i am not angry at hi am. i am past that. i was accepted to a college that i have wanted to go to for years yesterday. this is the worst i have felt in years. i hope i do not wake up tomorrow morning. i just want to be gone from here. there is no one i can trust, it never helps. i can get plenty more friends but this loneliness wi will never leave me. i would not ever find someone that would love me because i do not think i could bring myself to trust them, let alone try to speak to them. i act like nothing phases me, people see me as an inti amidating silent type of guy who could not possibly take offense to anything. but when i see myself in the mirror, i see a scared little boy getting kicked on the playground. i see a fatass getting toyed with and then rejected. i see something hideous that could never be fixed or covered up. the reality is, i am silent because i am scared of speaking. i hate my voice. i regret everything i say, i wi will probably regret typing this post. i do not want to insult anyone or hurt anyone with my words by saying the wrong thing, so i try not to say anything at all. but then i slowly forget, i slowly get complacent and build up confidence until i say something that once again, i come to regret. and each ti ame it happens, i hate myself just a little bit more. it would seem that i have spiraled a bit into a wall of text remember how i said i hate liars? with how often i lie to myself, i am the biggest liar i know. i really, truly hate myself. i am sure i wi will be alright when i wake up, this is just the tiredness talking. that was a lie.	moderate
why can not i make friendships hi, this is my first post. i have wanted to see if other people can relate to this i can not seem to get friends to stay. i am a very social person at heart and love talking to people. as a kid and teen i always had heaps of friends and did stuff all throughout the week with small and large groups. i am now and it seems no one is interested in me anymore as a friend. i talk to whoever i can and i am kind, respectful, try to be funny and easy going but it is like no one cares. i can initially make friends but then they start to never reply to text and always cancel plans or not want to do anything in the first place. i do not know if i have something wrong with me or if people are just like this around that age group. i have pretty bad depression but you wouldn t know unless i told you. i always try to be the happiest person in the room. i just want people to care about me and make a little effort to do something fun once in a while. i am getting to the point i feel so overwhelmingly lonely and feelings of suicide are resurfacing again after years of being depressed. does anyone else feel like this?	moderate

how to i talk to people about wanting to die? for some reason i have had the idea in the back of my head that i would just stop existing soon. i am not sure what made me think this, but i recently came to the conclusion that i probably have a full life ahead of me and that idea has made me i ammeasurably upset. just the thought of sti will being alive in years has made me cry myself to sleep for the past week. the only things i have to live for are short term and i am so tired. despite my overwhelming sadness about living, i do not think i could never find the courage to ki will myself. i have just been hoping that something happens to me. like i get sick or get into an accident or murdered or something. i am not sure how to talk to anyone about this. i know that no matter who i talk to, they wi will react in an unnecessarily extreme manner. i could talk to my therapist, but it is her job to take stuff like this super seriously. i could try my friends, but they would probably end up talking to my family about it out of fear. i do not want to ki will myself, but i feel that there is not a way to convince people that i mean it, so they would react like i would. i do not know what to do or where to turn. the last people that i want to involve in this is my family. i could not do that to them. they would try to blame themselves. what am i supposed to do? how do i even have a conversation about this?	moderate
my life is fine yet i sti will do not want it? i spent probably minutes trying to type this out but everything i say does not sound right and i sound pathetic.i am going to try to sum it up. i have every emotion running through me constantly like they never go away, only someti ames some emotions are stronger than the others. i dwell on the past to much, i dwell on my future to much. i feel like no matter what i do i wi will always be a failure. my life really is not that bad and that is why i feel and sound so pathetic saying all this because i have no reason to feel the ways that i do. but i do and i can not stop it. it is just getting worse and worse as ti ame goes on and i do not know what to do. i would never take my life away i know it would hurt the people around me. but the only reason it comes to my mind so much is because i feel like i wi will never feel better no matter what i do with my life. and at that point it is almost like i would rather die and live no life at all than accomplish everything and sti will feel this way. and yes i know like i said this is pathetic and i hate myself for it but i just want it to go away.	moderate

why do i like fucked up people, and why do i like to be fucked up? i feel like it is wrong for me to like people because of the fact that they are so fucked up and that i would rather be fucked up as a way for me to feel special or different rather than the idea of being normal so much that i would rather destroy myself and have broken people surrounding me than try to just be myself. i do not even know who i am. i continuously lie to myself and persuade myself that i am depressed, i should die, i probably have all of these mental i willnesses, that i should have all of these mental i willnesses. i suppose it is a coping mechanism in the way that i do not want my life to be boring, and the only way i have to cope with that is by destroying myself slowly. i like hearing about people is fucked up lives. in a way, it is entertaining. as in, i generally am able to actually feel something rather than remaining apathetic, as i do towards most things. the only thing that i know for certain is that i am an extreme masochist and sathist, and that i have no idea how i am, or should be, feeling. i do not even know the point of this post anymore. well, if anyone ends up reading this, thank you. i am sorry.	moderate
the past eight months have been a painful downward spiral. i have lost everything. my life is a joke, no one is laughing. i just can not seem to get a grip and move on from wallowing in my own self pity. i can not for the life of me sit in silence because my thoughts get so overwhelming, i always have a video or music playing. i am at the point where i am tired of asking why me and trying my best to turn it into why not me corny but this mantra has been helping me . i really need to just get it all out of my head, fuck. and perhaps stop living and ruminating there too. i have isolated myself from everyone and i mean e v e r y o and e . i tend to do this, even as a child, i remember scraping my knee and running away to hide in fear of my mom seeing me hurt. it does not come from being scared of being seen as weak, but instead, becoming an even bigger burden than the one i already know i am. everyone has shit they are dealing with amp i feel guilty unloading mine onto people who are just trying to handle their own. i know this is not healthy or fair for any of my loved ones because in turn, they end up thinking i am apathetic or do not care about them when i essentially ghost for days weeks months at a ti ame with little to no explanation. i hate myself for it and always want to reach out to ask how they are doing or let them know i am thinking about them but i do not. why? because i know what follows is them asking how i am doing and i have nothing good to say unless i lie. an i am okay!! doing better followed by emojis before i shut down the conversation before they can ask me anything more. my phone is completely empty. it sits days weeks without new notifications from any of my friends or family but i get it. it is a way street, and i do not put out my fair share. everyone has given up on trying to get me to catch up on handling my own shit, it is so pathetic that i get upset about being treated like a lost cause when i act like nothing but one. i avoided all my responsibilities, there are no excuses. i just have to face the consequences of my actions, or more accurately the lack of while i have been in this episode that has somehow fucking become almost a year. i wi will probably need to use a burner to truly get everything off my chest but in short dropped out of college to deal with a health problem, toxic family dynamic, legal trouble, insurance woes, sobriety and processing grieving the death of someone who i should hate for hurting me and causing so much fucking trauma ruined my first year of college has me so fucking lost. can not even say i am running on auto pilot because that i amplies i am functioning getting shit done.	moderate
help me sleep ok so this is my second post on here. i feel so much love for the people that have messaged me. honestly, it means the world. if i sti will talk to you or if it was just a quick convo for support...thank you. i do not really like drinking bc i make stupid mistakes and my emotions really come out depends on the setting i know i should not be drinking while on my medication...but what am i supposed to do? i am hurting so much and i just block everyone out if i do not go out and drink. i know how this must sound... you have a drinking problem . but no. i drink to numb the pain, but in the end i feel worse. do i just give up on life? it seems like the only option to survive is to drink until you feel happy. but these people i call friends do not stick around until the end. and they do not have to. i know they do not understand. i am crying out for help but i out on a mask that shows me smiling. and then i am back to blaming myself.	moderate
school counselor told my parents i went to see my school counselor because of my depression grades slipping and we met a couple ti ames and then she basically told me that i had to either find a therapist on my own which would be incredibly stressful for me and nearly i ampossible as i do not have my driver is license yet, or she could tell my parents and they could get a therapist for me. my parents are fine and there is nothing inherently wrong with telling them but i am not sure i was ready for them to know and i felt like she just kind of rushed me into it and i was not really prepared she did not give me any ti ame to process and called as soon as i left the room. also she basically said that because i could not find any concrete reasons why i did not want to tell them i should not be scared to and it was the right thing to do. so anyway i ended up having a breakdown in my th period because i was so anxious and things are weird between me and my parents, we have not really talked about it and my mom has started treating me like i am really fragile and need constant checking in with.	moderate
just need to vent for the past two years i have sacrificed a lot for my so to achieve his degree and job with that degree. it was only supposed to be a few months maybe months at most. due to everything under the sun happening some uncontrollable and some not. at the end of all this ti ame i feel i have lost myself, my freedom car, career, financially and i am so depressed. i sit at home all day miserable. the degree has not paid off financially due to a board of medicine exam happening tomorrow actually. i take my daughter to school and get her in the afternoon but i have no money or car to go and do anything we used to do together what she wants to do. not to mention i am so depressed i do not know and to even wake up. i actually hope that i do not wake up everyday. my so keeps having success and progression towards his goals and dreams and brings it up all the ti ame i know he wants me to be happy and see that things wi will change but i feel like a dagger goes through my heart each ti ame while my resentment increases by . i feel like i can not celebrate all these things everyday, over and over like he wants when i do not want to even exist. i feel he sees this but only wants to say the same shit about how we re so close to fixing everything. to be honest..i just do not fucking care anymore. about anything.	moderate
further i go i just do not know what to do anymore. i can not take life or the inevitable future that is coming to me. i do not see myself getting any better no matter what. i have no one to really talk to cause i feel no one even actually listens. they just pretend like they do just to get things from me. i try to be the nice guy, but no matter what i am never good enough for people. i tried not caring about what people think about me, like who cares about what they think i am my own person. but deep down it hurts that the fact that no matter what i am the black sheep in the world. i do not want to live anymore and suffer for people is amusement. i try to make others happy no matter what, but no one cares about me. i lost all my friends. i most of my stuff, and when i say most i mean i have things from all the stuff i had. i tried to fall in love, but only fell for grievance. i have no wi will to live anymore. its the same as last year but worse. if i were to completely decide that i ama end it once and for all i want everyone to feel like how i do right now not family . cause i try not to hide my emotions and literally no one cared. and i know for a fact that when i die everyone wi will be on dick about it. i just want to be happy. i just want the pain to go away. but it never wi will ti will i am dead. end of rant	moderate

i do not belong i have autism, so processing and communicating is extremely difficult for me. i have always been the quiet guy since elementary school and i remember on the first day of kindergarten that i was begging my mom to take me home. i have never been happy anywhere except on a baseball field or in my bed. no one would talk to me in school except for one friend, who was my best friend, but i was just another one of his friends. high school was when he stopped wanting to hang out with me, but we were sti will friends in school. one ti ame in class, he was talking about a fishing trip he was going on with his dad and his other friend when our teacher asked hi am why he did not invite me. he said that he knew i wouldn t want to go, but he never asked if i did and he knew i used to frequently go fishing . that was when i realized i was not really wanted. i stopped interacting with people completely and spent all my ti ame in my room, away from everyone. my senior year, i took online classes to graduate so i did not have to go to school. that was when i isolated myself for about years, and someti ames wouldn t leave the house for months at a ti ame. i enrolled in community college and transferred to university after serious pressure and because i was seriously worthless. sti will, no one wants anything to do with me. everyone is in their own group and they do not want anyone else well, they do not want me . i made the mistake of trying tinder and have not matched with anyone despite getting over likes. i know i am not unattractive, but not a single person wanting anything to do with me just makes me feel undesirable, unwanted, and unloved. i do not see this changing because i do not have any qualities or anything of value to offer anyone and i can barely handle a conversation. i just wish i was not born. i am a waste of space and a resource drain. i have made plans to ki will myself and i have written the note, so i guess this is it. i do not expect anyone to read this and i am not sure why i wrote it. i am glad i would not have to be unhappy and miserable anymore.	moderate
why is it so overwhelming? oh my god, i did not know being hopeless but trying to find hope is so fucking scary, i do not want to die, but i can not fucking deal with it anymore. i can not find any reason to fucking live anymore, i have deleted social media, told everyone i love them. now i just carry out the plan i have been thinking about for the past hour. please, i can not find help within myself, i might just fuck it and do it. i am tired of it, the stress is so overwhelming, even if i live, i wi will feel more embarrassed and ashamed, that i wi will never talk to anyone again, so what is the fucking point, i can not anymore. i have been through enough hell, i can not handle it anymore. please. i do not know what to do anymore, if i do not know what to do, i am edge more to suicide.	moderate
i just want to give up it does not matter what i do or how hard i try to get better it just does not work. this week has been yet another bad one where each day i regret waking up and looking forward to sleeping again only to not being able to sleep due to constantly racing thoughts. i just want to give up. just tell everyone i am out and be done with it. i barely have any reason to live on anymore and i see no point in trying to continue a life where i have not enjoyed the past few years or so. its just pointless to live on. i am not doing it for my friends anymore, not for myself and just for my parents but i know that no matter how much their pain wi will be it wi will soon all leave. i know some of them wi will be relieved after hearing about my death. i know some of them would rather see me go because else they wouldn t act so mean. so why should not i? i do not care about my future yet everyone prevents me from doing what i think is best. you guys would be better off without me. just let me die.	moderate
venting about life hey everyone, just here to vent because there is no one i can properly talk to about this. bit of backstory about me, i have had depressive thoughts since i was in pri amary school. i was about or years old when i started fantasising about dying and around when i first had suicidal thoughts. i have had thistorted eating and more severe eating thisorder issues since i was around the same age. now, i am and i am sti will not happy. i met a girl the other day who said your the happiest person i have ever met! and all i could think was how absolutely miserable i was. i just do not come across as depressed. i am always the life of the party, i am the friendliest most outgoing person and i am always drinking and having fun. i drink to numb my thoughts and forget about my life, i have had hundreds of sexual partners and countless questionable sexual encounters because it is a thistraction. since i was i have just been drinking and fucking to forget and to try and move on. none of this really makes sense and i did not really explain anything but i guess the point is do not think you know someone by how they act. depression is a horrible thing and it effects everyone differently, some people just mask it better then others.	moderate
my boring story you might want to read every ti ame i feel anxious, i scroll past the phonebook, go ti will the last contact only to find nothing. not a single number where i can call and just talk. i have zero social life and no friends to be very honest. it was not always like this, but now it is. i do not think i can do anything about it. people somehow just do not understand depression, and always suggest you to be happy . they do not understand we hold the same wisdom as them, just that we can not get rid of this phase.	moderate

i feel like i am slowing marching towards inevitable suicide, i am almost certain that is how i wi will die i have had on and off stages of depression for about years, as of late it has been the worst it is ever been. my thoughts are growing increasingly thisturbing and i can not stop myself from thinking these horrible things. i started cutting myself maybe once a week but it has grown to almost every night now, i find it hard to get joy from things that i once loved, most of the joy i bring from the day is sitting in the bath cutting my upper thighs as to not show any cuts and bother anyone with this, or seem as thought i want attention. i try to thistract myself as much as i can, body boarding, riding biking for long periods. but as soon as i am alone in the house i can not stop the thoughts and it eats at me, i fantasise about suicide often, who would cry, who would be glad, my parents being sad is probably my main reason for not attempting. i am and feel as though it is inevitable that i wi will eventually ki will myself and i wi will never escape the prison i have made myself.	moderate

deleted my social media i am going through so much in my head that i can not even process or label, and i winded up just basically deleting my social media. i feel like it is stopping me from being myself. i have my own self acceptance, but something is making me crave constant validation and i hate it. i feel like such a black sheep, such the odd one out and i hate how i am labeling isolating myself as such because of it. i would almost do anything just to feel loved and accepted unconditionally by my closest friends because they are the only family i have. when it is not them, it is anyone. it is coming to a point where i am just feeling the need to speak, feel lethargic every day and just can not sleep no matter how much i try. i deleted my social media because i do not feel like myself on there. i just want to be my true self in a world where i love and accept myself, it is so lonely to notice that others do not truly accept me.	moderate

wish there was assisted suicide for depression i have been depressed for pretty much my entire intelligent life and never been happy. there was once a ti ame when the thought of dying was upsetting to me, but it is not anymore. i have given life plenty of chances and tried several different solutions with nothing to show for it. i wish i was dead, and i do not think suicide would be very difficult to commit right now. just get in my car, get on the highway and drive max speed and veer off into something. my only regrets would be leaving a mess for someone else to clean up, and wasting all these organs i have kept in pretty great condition. i could save several lives by donating my organs, and there is no surefire way to ki will myself that leaves my organs intact for donation. it feels so unbelievably wasteful and incredibly unfair that there are many people out there who my organs could save or help that actually want to live. i wish there was a relatively painless way to off myself while preserving my organs for removal. at least then i would have something good come out of my death other than just ending my own suffering.	moderate

going to pretend someone cares briefly it is totally awful feeling that you have absolutely nobody to confide in. because of this, i always try to ensure others around me know that i can always be used as support and i love doing things to remind people that i am in their court even if no one else is. it is so isolating feeling that way and i hate to know others do. and yet i feel as though i do not have people in my corner. i am so grateful to have the i ammediate family that i do but otherwise.. i feel like everything is crumbling. i feel a sense of i ampending doom. i can not confide in family for certain things because i do not want to thisappoint or hurt them. but all my friends i feel have let me down tremendously. i have no one that i can call, crying, in the middle of a breakdown that wi will care enough to talk me through whatever is at hand and tell me things wi will be okay. i know this is not anyone is responsibility but it hurts when i have lifelong friends doing that to me, and on the offhand that i call, the conversation shifts from my needing support to a casual conversation within minutes because they begin to talk about their own issues. maybe it is a human thing that everyone experiences and this makes me feel selfish that i expect anyone to care so much. but it is sti will really hard. i wouldn t even say that many things bothering me are extremely pressing or debilitating to hear, i just have no one that cares. i hate posting about it here but it makes me feel better to say these things. i am not sure where this post is going anymore or if it fits here	moderate

can she really get taken to court?? uk i have not been to school for around a month now, my mocks are starting next week and i have my gcses in a few months. i have anxiety so attending has been hard for me recently, i have been through some touch social situations and it is caused me to feel isolated i have always had anxiety but now it is even worse and i have finally broken.. especially as exams are coming up. but i have made sure to keep studying at home so that i do not fall back. today my head of year came to my home as i resisted attending a second meeting with hi am after i found the first one unhelpful, i ended up relapsing again. he said that home study is not an option this far in year , also saying that i am incapable of studying on my own. well we have covered basically all the content in school so i know how to revise and follow the appropriate specifications. another thing he said is that my mother could be taken to court and fined. is this really true? i have been on the uk government website it said that physical and mental i willnesses are both treated the same, and are valid reasons for being absent from school. i can not control the way i feel, yet it feels like i am being forced into school whether i like it or not. i amagine telling a physically sick person this. something is just not adding up. are there really no other ways around this? i am really feeling like i am being bullshitted, my family are going through a lot of stress after hearing what he had to say.	moderate
a curse social prison i sleep half of the day, rely on my phone for socializing and feel miserable all the ti ame. i keep searching for friends on a daily basis. i write to vent but it does not always work. someti ames the sadness is overwhelming that i want to be alone and not talk to or see anyone. the ignorance about depression is making things worse someti ames when people give advices, opinions, judgments, to put yourself out there and talk to strangers or join a club as it is not so si ample for many. it could be a societal thing or a financial thing or anything else. while the world goes out of the door to get busy in different ways, there are people like myself who look out of the window or lie on the couch because there is nothing really to do and music or anything is not exciting the mind anymore. i someti ames only go out of the house to get groceries as i have no one that can help me in this. people outside can not notice my depression as i look good but depression is a subtle thing so this makes it hard to get understanding. also do not know anymore what to say really, the mind just feels blank. most people are not real also, they just use one another for comfort as long as it is required and then walk away like you re nobody.	moderate

i wish i was born as a woman instead of a guy. as a guy, i am not allowed to have feelings or emotions and i need to look like a wrestler and have a body shape like one and have a great career with lots of money. as a guy you are not allowed to cry, you are not allowed to do anything but work, be tough and be manly. if you get in a relationship then you find women who want you for your looks and money and wi will def give you a chance and want to talk to you. if you get in a relationship with a woman then they say show some emotions show some feelings and the second you do they are gone. if you are ugly or heavily overweight as a guy and are poor women do not want you and would not give you the ti ame of day. but as for women, does not matter what size shape or how thin or big a woman is or how pretty or ugly she is, there is always and i mean always going to be guys who want her and wi will date her easily and wouldn t have no issues with dating her even if she was over lbs and had no income. i wish i was born as a woman then maybe just maybe i wouldn t made it years of my life being single and alone and lonely and dateless no matter how hard i put myself out there or how much confidence and self esteem and how much i liked myself or was happy in life i was. none of it mattered or did anything for me. they say love yourself, how can i love myself when everyone and even my own family hate me and do not want me around? have confidence, i get told this all the ti ame, i have had so much confidence and it has done absolutely nothing for me. self esteem, i had self esteem and thought i was pretty cool and thought i was assured and felt i was a good person but none of it mattered. none of it landed me a date or a woman who was interested in me becuase i am overweight and poor and women do not want guys like me. but if i were a woman who had no confidence, no self esteem, did not love myself and had no income or very little income and i was ugly and overweight all i would have to do is post up a picture and put female on a dating profile and get over a thousand guys messaging me wanting to be with me even if it were for just my body and sex. at least i would sti will be wanted as a woman.	moderate

for this rotten existence i lead. i was born into a terrible family, where my earliest memories are an elder sister wishing me dead amp my parents arguing with constant tension. we had no family friends, we had no outside family beyond i ammediate none of my family appeared to have friends, and both my mother and father were social outcasts. my days were spent entirely alone, with my father ignoring me mostly, my mother at work, and my sister hating on me constantly. i first considered suicide when i was years old, as i dreaded going home, i never had friends and was considered weird and avoided since day one. as my parents both fought constantly, slept in seperate beds amp offloaded there woes to me, i have developed a complete fear of social interaction. i avoided and froze around girls, and have never had a decent friend or relationship. to this day, at years old, i have never been on a date, never had a girlfriend, never invited to a party, never hung out with friends at a pub, never even really had a friend. no matter the social situation, no matter the setting, no matter the people, i am considered weird and vastly thisliked. no one wants to talk to me let alone touch me, as if i am infectious or that i am some serial ki willer or something. i am treated as a monster and despised by everyone i have ever met. people wi will purposefully sit away from me, they wi will stare at ti ames usually because i am so ugly amp quite frequently i wi will get abuse and or rubbish hurled at me from passing cars. i have been in rooms where someone wi will greet and introduce themselves to everyone in the room, and skip shaking my hand or ignore me entirely. its been that way for as long as my memory goes. i am completely invisible, and was nicknamed mute during late high school as i never spoke and never expressed myself. i learned not to. confidence and happiness are things i wi will never truly understand. i am littered with moles and freckles all over my body and face which i can do nothing about. as a child i begged my mother to see if i could get them removed, as i had moles bleeding, she promised but nothing ever progressed. throughout early teens i had the most horrendous pain in my right leg, which no matter how much i cried and complained was brushed off as growing pains. eventually it was thiscovered i had a tumour there, when the doctor recommended getting it removed i was relieved, yet we never saw the doctor again. nothing ever happened amp i continue with the pain to this day. by this ti ame i was taught to shut my mouth, and learned that complaining or talking about my issues led nowhere. suffer in silence was the lesson insti willed in me, and i have suffered in silence ever since. add to this some awful dentistry and large bottom lip which means i can not close my mouth or speak properly, i can understand why girls would avoid me. i am one of the ugliest men on the planet. of this i am certain off. i have heard the term ew to many ti ames to count. i flunked education as i could not focus and never made friends. even uni is failing because i can not bear to go and be seen in public. the humiliation, the hatred towards me, the isolation. its something i just could not bear. i was even drinking hard spirits in the parking lot trying to remove the anxiety before stepping out the car. someti ames i can not even leave the car, the anxiety and shame is too much and i end up driving home. i am sti will living at home, i have no money, no car and my dead end job is enough to pay for cigarettes. my sister is diagnosed as schizophrenic, she screams to herself and stays in the house all day. she has hated me my entire life, and i do not believe she has said a word to me in years. she once unprovoked jabbed my eye so hard my vision is sti will i ampaired, and i have slight lazy eye because of it. my father i am certain has some type of mental i willness, he sits in front of the computer all day smoking, ignoring me as he has done most his life. my mother is only slightly sane, but leaves the house at every opportunity, its probably for the best, her constant thisappointment and shame for her kids is most likely heartbreaking. yet none of them know how i am faring or whats going on in my life. i have thought of suicide for over a decade, and despite me holding on, despite me believing it may get better, despite trying to be a good person and giving all i have to people, my life is sti will a train wreck. others may be depressed yet they often have a gf bf, or a friend, or a degree or even a family to talk to. i have nothing, i do not believe i have had physical contact since i was years old. i do not even know what a friend would feel like. no one has called my phone for years. it is a saturday night, and i am crying into a whiskey bottle while smoking my last cigarette. i have tried therapy, but i often get the same response from them as i do from everyone else. one did not even return my calls, another moved practice and would not answer my emails. i could go on and on for days about the misfortune i have suffered, and events and details which would make most people think they are watching a horror movie. i want to die, i want to die so badly it hurts. every waking hour of my life is fi willed with both physical pain and mental anguish. its slowly and slowly getting worse, and i really fear for the future. i have achieved absolutely nothing in my life. i have never even been in a photograph. i may as well not exist, it would be better for society amp better for me. i am starting to avoid light, i close myself of and feel fear even if i see an oncoming car as i am conditioned to receive nothing but abuse and bad vibes. honestly i apologise to anyone who is read this, i just needed somewhere to vent. i can not go on like this much longer, to be at the very bottom of every social ladder, to have nothing and no one, to see others my age thrive and embrace their youth, while i am slowly ageing with no one at my side. i hope that anyone reading this has had a smile, maybe a hug, maybe even a laugh with a friend. because i have never had that, and have forgotten how to smile or how to be happy. its just darkness, and its getting darker. i could have summed this all up with the i ammortal words of freddie mercury i do not want to die, someti ames wish i was never born at all 	moderate

whats the point in living if no one cares about you being there or not so a few days ago, i started to feel really lonely and basically became really jealous on the others at school because they seemed to be waaaay happier than me year old male . i have no friends, no one ever said hi to me in around years. however, that sti will is not the sad part. i decided to put a story on instagram already seems like a bad idea probably where i put a pic of a suicide note written by me and you could easily tell it was written by me because i had a few parts mentioning my name and the town i live in. a week passed and no one. literally no one bothered to talk to me or even look at me. the story has views and most of them are from people from my school. at first i was not really sad or anything on the situation, i was mostly thisappointed because of how people just forget to be humans and all that. everyone is too busy posting pics to show how cool they are but if someone actually has a mental i willness no one cares. another week passed and i start to realize how much of a sad fuck i am. now you are probably wondering dont you have parents? well my father died a couple of years ago and my mom is busy finding happiness again with her crazy pervert boyfriend. i have tried speaking to her a few ti ames, i even tried speaking with her boyfriend but they seem to be too caught up with their own existential problems to see me. i can not dont feel the need to live anymore, please help.	moderate
i hate being constantly told everyone goes through it whenever i try explain my feelings to someone older than me. the only response i ever get is. its a part of life or its normal . i am diagnosed with depression personality thisorders and several traits of several other things. but whenever i go to explain my feelings to someone without explicitly telling them i have these things they presume its all normal its intensely infuriating and just makes me feel worse. normalizing these horrible feelings can have some really bad affects on people. so before you presume what someone is feeling is normal. listen to them. maybe ask if it affects there life in any way. and ask them if they think these feelings and actions are abnormal. you really could stop a whole load of emotional pain by just asking these questions.	moderate

looks like no questions asked voluntary euthanasia just became legal in germany. theres nothing more inhumane than forcing an individual who did not consent to being brought into this world, to live a life in a socioeconomic system they had no say in building. we are cattle forced to graze so that oligarchs and plutocrats can get richer than they already are. i have been looking a lot into legal voluntary euthanasia the last few months. i do not even feel that my life is particularly bad but i feel the only control i really have is in removing myself from the machine that bloodies so many others. wondering if anyone else has considered making one last trip to a country where it is legal to make the final journey? the cost is usually prohibitive, especially when many of the cause of the feeling that be traced back to the lack of money. just interested to hear anyone is thoughts or hear to be an ear for anyone struggling. i empathize with everyone is struggle and you ll receive no judgement from me as long as you are not hurting others.	moderate

i feel like going down in a pitch black hole i am years old and male. months ago i broke up with my girlfriend, that i had for six years. for the last two years she was struggling with major anxiety issues and a depression and i supported her as much as i could, completely ignoring my own problems. she did see two therapists but both of them sucked at their job and only made it worse. in the end i could not take it anymore because i started to be depressed myself and she gave me so much shit about me not caring for her although i did my best for her. after the break up everything got worse. she proceeded to telling me that i am a worthless piece of shit but in the same text she says that she loves me so much, that i am the best that ever happended to her and she wants me back. she had to go to mental health care centers and even was in the hospital because she collapsed at the day of the break up. i am so ashamed that i done this to her but i could not make anything different for my own sake. everyday she wrote me a text i was happy because it meant she did not ki will herself. this went on for three months and i just did not know what to do spiraling down into hating myself, concentrating on my failures in studying, my bad body shape, money problems and everything else that i do not like in my life. so fast forward to last tuesday where i met a girl and we made out. turns out she had to leave today to another country so i did everything to see her a last ti ame before that because she made me feel worth something for the first ti ame in months. we had a date yesterday, it was fun und we even had sex although that was not planned. i really felt happy til today at . suddenly everything came back even harder than before. like i pulled a rubber band and it snapped so hard back in my face. i have lots of friends i could talk to but i am just too afraid. i am more concerned what others may think of me than how i feel. i just do not see the purpose anymore... actually i do not even know if i ever had one. i wasted years studying something i did not want to and in the end i had to quit. there is nothing i really burn for, nothing i want to do in my life. it is the first ti ame that i realise this, but i have been like this since i can remember. just surpressing everything that could bother me or trigger bad emotions and let it rest in me for eternity. on the one hand i want to see a therapist and talk about everything on the other hand i am too afraid to talk or see what is behind my mask that not even i can look behind because it is been too long since i layed it off. thanks for reading dear stranger. just writing this eased the pain a little	moderate

both me and my best friend suffer from depression but i have recently realized that more people care for hi am than me. throw away account. me m and my friend let us call hi am kit m met in high school and really did not start to hangout until senior year. we had a si amilar upbringing and problems we were both overweight and both had troubles with bullying as kids and both came from pretty poor backgrounds. there are some major differences in childhood that we had but that is not i amportant. the gist is that we both care for each other and are good friend but we handle our problem differently. he took to the booze while i stay away from it due to family history, he is much more open with his i willness, while i tend to be quiet about it. he was the brooding kid in high school i was the class joke. so naturally people started to give hi am attention. this bothered me for a long ti ame and warped my perception of what it means to suffer from depression. i started to feel like maybe nothing was wrong with me and i was being a asshole. but as ti ame went on and we got older he graduated and lost most of his weight, lost his virginity, and he has made more friends and is a very sociable he is doing well for hi amself and i am proud of hi am. he sti will post online about his depression and talks extensively about ki willing hi amself though. i unfortunately gained more weight, i am not sociable anymore. do not get me wrong i can be but i tend not to and he is sti will my only close friend. i have been coming to terms with myself as i want to lose weight, i want to find love, and i want to be more social. i am starting to come to terms with my sexuality i realized i am bi i have an attraction to men and women , i realized what i want to do with my life, and i realized i do not want to be this way anymore and i want to make changes to my life. well anyways i started making these moves toward my betterment and it is made me have to make decision for my own sake. i recently made a decision not to move in with kit. we planned on doing after university and i told hi am that after i move out of my moms place i wanted to sort of get a fresh start and figure out who i am. i have not come out to my friend or family just yet i am sti will in the process of accepting myself and i feel that i can not do that with other people preconceptions of me. i needed a break in the status quo. i am not ending my friendship with my friend i just need a change. my friend being the great dude he is understood and took it well however everyone of his friend and some of his family did not. they thought i was being selfish, and breaking a promise. they believe that i am abandoning hi am and that he needed his close friend to help hi am over come his problems. even my own mother said what i was doing is not fair to hi am. it made me realize how my feelings did not matter. it made me break my diet, it made me contemplate suicide and it made me realize i could never tell these people how i feel because they would think i am making excuses or jumping on a band wagon with my friend. when people see my friend they see someone who has been suffering from depression since high school and when people see me they see that dumb class clown who did not have a care in the world. i hate it here. i do not want to be here anymore. i want to clarify that i am not angry or jealous of kit. i am glad he lost weight and i am glad he doing better. i just feel that because he has been open about his problems for years i feel that if i brought up mine his wi will dwarf my problems. i feel like i am not allowed to feel the way i feel or that i am too late and should have said something earlier. sorry for the long post had to get this off my chest. thank you for reading. please excuse spelling grammar mistake i wrote this on mobile.	moderate

a better day happy i was quite depressed from unwhelming work ethic and accomplishment and overwhelming work last week. it got so bad i told myself many things subconsciously and paid the price to go to a therapist. although i thought i was strong enough to give it some ti ame and think it would get better, it definitely helped me get perspective. therapy is not a quick fix but it does speed up the process of progress and feeling better! i have also been in ti ames sad so much as that i think i almost enjoy it such as being lonely sad and wondering as to why i have not had a long term relationship yet, but that is for another ti ame how bad it was i was very behind on my courses and after coming home from them would just collapse sad crying and hopeless. i got really thistant from everyone and felt useless overall. i thought college wasnt right for me and that i never really ever had a good work ethic or goals in mind to accomplish anything. i told my parents and they both got very helicopter y which was fair. i just needed to talk and sought out help multiple ti ames, often indecisive until i built up courage. i wasnt thinking straight. i failed an exam because i told myself i could not do it as in i knew more than i wrote down when i should have tried to get it postponed on the basis of mental i willness if that would work . it was bad. how i recovered i focused on myself. i mediated daily someti ames more. i started working on my body at the gym more. i became more outgoing and told atleast close friends family what was going on. and i also sat down to study for my next exam alot, went to the library for the majority of the week. i would start by meditating and then someti ames with breaks a short walk or meditating again. i am set on going to the museum today with some classmates and going to a hangout with friends later. you can do it.	moderate

i should technically be happy let me start off by saying that i consider myself to be a very lucky person. nothing to do with depression, but rather with the opportunities and quality of life for the very little effort i have put into it. i have a job i am ok with even though i am a drop out, sti will young, physically healthy, without debts, etc. i never take a single day for granted because i have been around the worst periods of my life and know that it could be so much worse. i have done my fair share of misery. plagued with suicidal thoughts, hate, envy, heartbreak, tantrums, breakdowns and feelings of isolation and worthlessness for years that is left a complete void in my soul. it is relatively better today, but it is ti ame lost i wi will never get back. i have accomplished absolutely fuck all in the last years, gaining close to zero life experiences or friendships. i take full responsibility for it as i have had all the opportunities to do make it different. my biggest problem is that i have been too much of a coward my whole life. i think i finally reached the critical point where strong emotions have no effect on me, this goes for all feelings. i am not as angry for instance because there is no logical conclusion that would make me feel better. i lack the energy to bother. you can only cry yourself to sleep so many ti ames until it becomes mundane. it feels like my body and mind are in li ambo. everyone and everything just matters less overall now , people and family included. my focus is mostly on work because at least i get to feel appreciated. i have been down this road too many ti ames to not even bother any more, i mostly just repress it all and put on my invisible rose tinted goggles. i am not old, but i feel old. i have become boring and unmotivated to try and resolve. at some point, we must accept who we are, our faults and short comings. i stopped talking about it, as i found it only served as a medium for rumination. it is harder though because of how much energy my job saps away from me and the complete lack of of trust i have in other people. my income feeds a degenerate dopamine junkie who lives on junk food, video games, porn and gambling. it is the only thing i can do without feeling utterly bored. however, even those things have come to feel entirely pointless and repetitive and i long for something with meaning. the price i pay is self loathing. if i felt too weak, lazy and unthisciplined before to change, depression just adds another mental layer of difficulty. my many attempts to change patterns have been very short lived. it is thisgusting just how thisorganized i am and how little everything matters. how little motivation there is to even do si ample tasks with perpetuates the cycle.	moderate
i do not even know this is going to be quite long so skip it if you want to. i have been feeling really out of it for the longest ti ame feeling lethargic, depleted and just so so tired. every morning i have to physically drag myself out of bed and even talking or moving around is a chore for me. i do not know if this is depression or just me sti will suffering from my burn out from last year, where my little situation got worse to this point. i was studying for my gce a levels and burnt out months before the exam. physically could not study or do anything at all when i am working or on the rare occasion that i am out with friends, i am usually the most bubbly and cheerful person, the person who cracks jokes and makes the most retarded comments, the person who is always full of life. but this little burst of energy wi will last for minutes or so and then i just completely shut down. on the weekends or after i get back home from work, i isolate myself completely from my family, lock myself in my room and i do not communicate with anyone at all. i end up getting scolded by my parents for speaking so softly, moving so slowly, being so mechanic, laying in bed and doing absolutely nothing at all, being called dull and listening to the constant rants of why can not you just be brighter and happier? just because i si amply do not have the energy to function. i have lost interest in almost everything i have enjoyed doing, i can not be bothered to do anything at all, i just do not care about anything anymore. it is just getting worse day by day and i used to think that you know, one day i wi will just get over it and be happy again. but that does not seem to be happening and i am just sinking deeper and deeper and i am afraid i wi will lose control one day. i have never sought any form of help, let alone be clinically diagnosed. most of the ti ame i tell myself that i am just a little bitch who can not handle hardships or that i do not even deserve to be depressed because honestly, what is there to complain about? maybe this is not as dramatic as i think it is, it is just me overreacting to the dumbest shit ever and i am just a privileged kid complaining about first world problems. i do not even know. i do not even know what i want. i just want to isolate myself from the world, lie in my bed, listening to sad songs, self pitying and slowly rot away. haha to those who made it all the way here, thank you man. really appreciate you taking out your ti ame reading a dumb bitch is rant.	moderate

went to a party last night just to cry in the middle of the crowd i finally built up the courage to dress nice and try to do my makeup so i could go to a party but being there just made me realize how really alone i am. everyone was dancing and talking to their dates and i was just there by myself in the sea of people. no one really compli amented me and no one really cared to say anything to me. i just felt stupid. i started crying in the middle of everyone before i left and went to the bathroom and finished. i just wanted to leave. i just felt unlovable and unwanted knowing that i will never be able to hold someone close and slow dance like they all were doing. i hate everything about myself	moderate

i dont know who i am anymore.. i started break last friday i have been off from school for about a week now and wi will be going back soon... one would normally think that coming back home and not having anything to do for an entire wee would be extremely helpful for their mental health, but i guess i was wrong on that one. ever since i got back home, i have been feeling myself get progressively sadder and weaker to the point that it takes me two hours to start something i want to do, whether it is getting ready to go out, brush my teeth, or si amply get up to use the restroom. my head has been spiraling nonstop and i can not take it anymore. last saturday was when everything actually began i suddenly had vertigo and it was hard to even roll over in bed without being so overly anxious about everything, i went to the bathroom, gave a good look at myself, and just started to cry... i do not know what happened after that, all i remember was going to bed and waking up in the middle of the night because my dream was too sad and depressing for me to want to continue having it. the morning after and every other morning since have all been shit. i can not focus on anything, eating is as hard of a task as it would be to deadlift lbs right now, everything i do has just been so draining, and i can see the sadness and the desperation on my face... i am questioning everything and everyone and it sucks that i feel as if i have no one because my own boyfriend is not being supportive or understanding and my other two friends are too busy for me to want to bother them... we re not that close anyways... i have been relying on my mom for everything, i have already bawled my eyes out to her three ti ames in just one week and i do not think i can do it again, i need help... i need something to help me feel human again because right now, i feel alienated from everything. shit, i can not even watch a movie normally, i can not watch funny videos like a regular person, i know they are funny in my head but i can not even let out a chuckle... i do not know what is wrong with me and i hate not knowing. i am ruining everything for myself. i am not ready to go back to school yet, not after this, but i have to... i want to succeed. the only things keeping me alive right now are the fact that i finally know what i want to do with my life and that my birthday is coming up... everything else is falling appart for me. my happiness, the control i sort of had over my anxiety, even my own fucking relationship... i can not tae this any longer... i want to skip all this so i can finally get to the happy part of my life... this sucks...	moderate

how do you deal with text messages? i feel like i become more and more reclusive. i never really want to go outside anymore and do not feel like being active or taking the ti ame to cook a good meal. when i get home, i just lay on the couch and read until it is ti ame to go to bed. when i receive a text from a friend, i read it instantly and am excited by the message and think about all the things i am going to say, but then keep thinking about what i am going to say. someti ames, i am hit by inspiration of what i feel is a great response, but i sti will do not reply. weeks wi will go by and i wi will constantly think about how i need to respond to the texts, but never feel like it. then, it another texts comes in from the person, i am afraid to read it because i know that i have not responded yet and it wi will take me another few days just to work up the courage to read it. it may take me weeks or even a month or two to reply. most of my friends that i sti will have left write long texts that can take me an hour or two to respond to when i finally feel like responding. by that ti ame, i feel kind of drained. i am not sure what to do and i feel horrible leaving them hanging and like a loser for constantly apologizing for my depression. i do not understand why i am like this and what to do to make it right. how often should i be responding?	moderate
i am stuck and i do not know how to overcome this i have been dealing with depression for many years although i am only and these past months have been a nightmare, i do not even know how i have managed to survive. i feel like such an useless person, i spend my days doing nothing but crying or being miserable, my friends are studying somewhere else and found new people, i am heartbroken because of a breakup main reason i am miserable and my situation at home is not the best. i do not want to die, i want to be happy so i can remember this situation in a few years and think of it as a lesson but i do not know how to get out of this which makes me wish i were dead instead. i have been getting help for years and i know moving out would be the first step to start over but i am so scared of being by myself... each day i feel smaller and smaller and completely unable to function as a normal person. i know a lot of people struggle and manage to deal with it but i feel so different from everyone, like all i see is people with their shit together for the most part while i am barely getting out of bed. self esteem issues obviously play a huge part since all i think is how i am just not meant to do anything interesting in life. i feel worthless sorry for the rant i do not even expect anything from posting this i guess i just wanted to let it out	moderate

finally get invited, but can not. i have sat at home for months. had a baby on halloween and it is been downhi will ever since. and no, do not blame ppd. i have no job, no friends that actually care, and nothing to do but sit here. i have always been self sufficient. paid my own way. i was raised to never need anyone, much less a man, to take care of me. in the spirit of that i always had high hopes for myself. i had dreams of finishing school and landing the perfect job so that i could teach my kids that hard work is worth it. i promised myself a long ti ame ago that i would never settle when it came to work. if my kids would have to witness an unhappy mom due to her work, then i wouldn t work there. but now, it seems like that is my only option. nobody wants to hire someone with kids. husband works so i have to be the one picking up from school and daycare. no grandparents to do it in a regular basis. everyone keeps saying, that is what happens when you have kids. fuck you if you think that. just saying. i have made it very clear what i need and people offer suggestions that i told them wouldn t work. and my husband says, quit being rude. and let me take care of things. i am not like that. i am a straight shooter. i do not sugar coat things and i damn sure am not okay with someone else paying my way. to add to it, i literally have nobody. all of my so called friends from my younger days ditched me a long ti ame ago because i got married and could not run wild with them anymore. i have been clinging to a virtual best friend for the last years. i say virtual because we can not actually hang out together. i am a chick, he is a dude, both married with kids, yet it is sti will inappropriate. so we text, messenger, and snapchat. that is all i have had as far as a best friend for the last years. and now, even that seems to be slipping away. he works long days, has ti ame with the family in the evenings and on weekends so that pretty much leaves no ti ame to listen to me bitch. i literally feel like everyone around just sits there and runs their mouth about me. sniggering behind my back and the looking at me with some stupid looks. even happens at church get togethers. i do not even want to go anywhere anymore. my sister called today. she never does. actually invited me to her house next weekend for a pure romance party. i am not going. i do not want to be around people, much less the uppity women she hangs out with. and when i tell her that i hear, what is going on? is it ppd? i am so very tired of people thinking that. i have battled depression for over years now. it has nothing to do with my hormones. i do not want to be here anymore. i have spent my entire adult life preaching to people about how suicide is wrong. i have lost people that way. i am the friggin poster child for anti suicide. so my question is, what about me? where is my fucking support? where are the people that clai am they care? they listen to me once and then get so far out of reach they are non existent. like, i spend years listening to their problems and trying to help, but the one ti ame i am in obvious pain and need them they were nowhere to be found. the only ti ame they do contact me is after having a gossip session behind my back about me first. i am so very tired of this world.	moderate

part of me. i hate my depression. it is a sickly thisease that keeps plaguing my brain, but i do not want to i amprove. i just want to stay this way and wither into the bed. it is not that i feel like i deserve this, nor do not deserve it. it is just become part of me that i not only do not want to live without, but can not fathom living without. i want to stay this way until my mental state rots away to the point where i am confident enough to ki will myself. there is not a point in being alive, and i just want it to end. my depression is so deeply ingrained in my skull, and i do not want to take any steps to remove it or alleviate it. what ll it change? my infinitesi amally small life? it does not matter whether i work to get rid of it or not. long story short, i have depression and hate it, but i do not want to get rid of it.	moderate
i feel so thisconnected from the world i am too weird for the normal people and too normal for the weird people. i feel like i am very socially self aware but at the same ti ame i could be a social dumbass and not even know it. weird people probably see me as weird. we are all so different. we re all products of our experiences and childhood. everyone has different experiences and childhood which means we all see the world differently. when i am by myself i wi will think i am so cool and clever but when i interact with the outside world i feel....off. like there is something i am missing. maybe i am just too judgemental and need to just chi will out. i just wish people would understand me and see me as i see myself. to get where i am coming from. relationships are so messy and forced unless you re some vani willa person. man i am so lonely.	moderate
how do i get my mom to understand when i tell my mom how i feel she takes this and it stresses her out. like she starts freaking out and saying how much stress she has and she does not deserve the stress in her life. if i tell her anything is bad she gets extremely stressed out and then i get angry that i can not talk about it and we get into an argument. i feel like everyone hates me and i am a burden to everyone. i can not talk to anyone. my boyfriend just thinks i am dramatic and he said it is hard to deal with me. i have nobody.	moderate
therapeutic venting depression is an awful way to spend a life and in some unfortunate cases can cause a life to be cut short. the scariest part about depression is that it can sneak up on anyone and affect the people who seem the least likely. i have been unlucky enough to experience the aftermath of someone taking the ulti amate path to ending their depression, twice. both ti ames is came seemingly out of nowhere, completely blindsiding me at the ti ame but looking back, i should have seen the signs and feel like i should have acted to prevent their decisions. this alone is a futile thought though, as when someone does not want to be helped it is always going to be hard to reach them. both of them reassured me that they were doing well and i took them at their word, some may call it naivety, but i want to be able to trust people. knowing what i know now of course, i would have acted, but hindsight wi will always be . in the grand scheme of things, how do i know that my words would have even altered their chosen path. i do not believe in fate, but someti ames i do believe that a person who is feeling trapped in their mind wi will find a way to end their suffering one way or another. this is after all, just the ramblings of someone who is struggling with their own mind and is trying to type this out to take his mind off of all of the turmoil inside. for some reason i have latched onto a poor girl and have laser focused my self worth behind what she thinks of me, more than likely driving her away. it is tough when you do not feel like you re in control of your emotions, seemingly spirally out of control without a moments notice. feeling like you re all okay when you are surrounded by people who care for you, but behind closed doors you sti will struggle to control yourself. there is strange waves of exhaustion that hit where you feel like you could crash but as soon as you try and crash your mind begins swirling in thoughts and things that cause anxiety and stress. i was worried about things out of my control and i broke my old adage control the controllables , my coach had built this adage into my everyday life as i would someti ames lose control of my emotions when i played. he could see that i would hide behind a false bravado and would attempt to mask many of my insecurities with humour, constantly self deprecating. he always made sure that i would repeat and focus on the adage and would hold myself accountable to the actions and emotions that i could control. i can not control what other people think of me, but i need to control my own perception of myself. this girl has been more than understanding and has given me plenty of leeway of how insecure i am and has done her best to put my mind at ease, but i have always assumed the worst intentions of people when i get in these sort of funks and i think i have finally pushed her away enough. the only reason that i am even writing this is because i was not able to sleep and hoped this would thistract me from the fact that i am awake at am. i am so scared that people wi will think so much less of me because i have these struggles, usually i am able to contain these on my own and put my brave face on when i feel it coming. but this ti ame it was too much, it built up too quickly and i was unprepared for the emotions that would flood through me. it is what made things so hard to control, i opened up to people that normally i would want to hide it from, i hate being perceived as weak, but i needed help. i had never really thought of suicide in a true way, but i have caught myself casually wishing that something on the outside would end it, maybe another car would take me out, a hit to the head, some sort of freak accident to spare my family the shame of me. those thoughts scared me and caused me to open up to a couple people, i probably should have kept my mouth shut as it did not truly feel like it helped anything, it may have even exacerbated things because some of the actions seemed to go in the complete opposite direction of where i thought they would go. then again, for all i know these negative thoughts have all just poisoned and pervaded into every other thought causing me to think the worst about peoples actions. and therein lies the problem of depression.. you begin to second guess your own thoughts because you know that you are being negative, but then you start to rationalise why that thought should be negative. it is the never ending loop that has been playing in my mind. then you start to second guess every interaction you have with people, wondering if they were being genuine or whether they are just trying to placate you because they know you re damaged goods. which just feeds into the self loathing because you start to truly believe that you re a burden on people and they are just looking forward to the moments away from you. if i send a message i wonder how it is perceived, if they do not respond i automatically assume that it is an eye roll type situation even if it is an innocent mistake of just forgetting to respond. this morphs into the worry that if you then message again you re being pushy and can not take a hint, so you end up checking up constantly and worrying that you have fucked everything up. it is a nasty cycle that i have managed to perfect quite. i have always had the worry in my mind that i have some sort of social awkwardness or inability to truly socialise, always feel like i am putting on a facade to make people like me. i think the whole reason that i have latched onto this girl is because i actually feel like i can be me around her and she has not run for the hi wills as of yet, she can be quite selfish but i believe the selfishness is more to do with a lack of forethought than malice. but then i sound positive and i almost have to remind myself that she has preferred to spend her nights sleeping with another guy and even though they both have been upfront about it not being sexual, i can not help but have those negative thoughts intrude and assume the worst. this feeds into why i believe that i have driven her away, surely she is sick of a neurotic, depressed individual pining after her and causing her undue thiscomfort with his brokenness. especially after telling hi am that she is not into feelings and relationships and he carrying on almost as if he has some sort of say in what she gets to do. unfortunately the way that this depression managed to invade my mind so stealthily was because of an anniversary. katrina took her life on the rd of february, but because of how our interactions had been going i assumed she had just gotten busy, so i got busy myself and managed to reach the pinnacle thus far of my career. so it was only on the th of february where i started to really worry that something was wrong, i looked her up and was ashamed to find out that she had passed away and i had not even realised. here i was celebrating myself and my achievements over text to her and her poor family were the ones who were probably receiving those messages in their grief. i was fortunately in a room to myself by this point and broke down, i felt so worthless that i had not been able to get her to see how special that she was to me and everyone else around her. she felt lost and i could not help her enough to find herself. the thing that hurt the most was seeing the date of her death and realising that i had been speaking to her the day before she made that fateful decision and knowing that she did not feel comfortable with me enough to share and tell me how much she was struggling. i guess that is one the reasons that i finally reached out to my parents on a particularly bad night exhaustion and hunger exacerbating the swirling thoughts in my head causing me to finally crack. katrina is anniversary also made me reflect on the way that i found out about luke, spoken to hi am in person less than a month before and he seemed so happy and relaxed. we spoke about the future and talked about how nice it wi will be for hi am to finally be able to relax without baseball and the worries of staying healthy. i had kept in contact with hi am while i was back in australia and although he someti ames seemed a little bit off, he always reassured me that he was doing well, made headway on seeing his children and i got to see updated pictures of them. i went away on a softball clinic in a remote area and was having a really good ti ame and had even messaged hi am about how it was such easy money to make because i was enjoying it. then suddenly i have one of our mutual friends asking if i would heard about luke, almost instantly i felt a knot in my stomach and knew that he had taken his own life. my worst fears were unfortunately realised as i started trying to prove things wrong, i felt numb, my vision tunnelled and i felt a bit lost. the only saving grace for that period was how i was able to continue to do the clinics and the kids were able to keep my mind away from all the negative emotions. but i had not dealt with them and that is where i went wrong, i pushed them to the side and just assumed that i would be able to talk about it down the track. but i never did, i did not want to, because it again felt like i should have had some part in preventing it and because i did not felt like i played a role in it. anger at luke also crept into my mind as he knew how hurt i was about katrina as he was one of the people that i spoke to about her, he was one of my closest friends and he sti will took his own life. some people say that it was probably to spare my feelings, which i do understand, but it does not soften the blow. obviously he could not go on anymore, but i would have rather he flew to australia and tried a fresh start here. i guess that this actually been a bit therapeutic to me, i do not even know why thought i would write this out, i have not written this for any other reason than that i wanted to pass the ti ame before i have to get up and try to go about my day productively. i was going to go for a run but i figured that was not the brightest of ideas considering that i had not eaten anything today and i am supposed to play a game in the afternoon. playing on hours sleep is certainly going to be an experience, hopefully i do not have any stupid breakdowns on the drive there. but i should not, i wi will just jam out to some music and try and push the bullshit to the bottom as i usually do. i am so sick of this, i just want to be normal. i have now involved too many people and i feel shit as is anyway, so that is fun. so many stupid as fuck decisions, but hey, that is just what i do. i wonder if i wi will read back on this and laugh about how dumb this all seems.. i hope so. maybe i can read this next year when i decide to go insane again and i can try and ground myself before i do all this dumb shit again. fuck me, you d think that i would have some sort of forethought and would stop being a drag to be around, no wonder you pushed people away and caused such an unnecessary amount of stress to people that do not deserve that. you have not even called your best friend back and let hi am ring out twice, you re lucky to have such an incredible friend and you take hi am for granted just because you re feeling weak. you re quite literally doing exactly what luke and katrina did to you to hi am, you can not get mad about things if you do not learn from their previous mistakes. have some feel and talk to hi am, maybe you can give hi am a call tomorrow on the drive there. wi will that reignite the turmoil or wi will that help quash it before you get out there? i guess you wi will have to find out. the trouble is that you re supposed to try and socialise with people when you re like this to thistract yourself, but it is hard when feel like you force people to be around you. i may even drop in and visit my friend tomorrow after the game, see if he wants to do dinner. i am sure he would not be too upset by it, but i do not want to feel like i am i amposing and i would feel shit if she was there because then it would just seem weird and creepy, not letting her enjoy her ti ame with hi am. he is certainly less of a wet blanket than you are currently.. the funny thing about this little essay that i have typed is that i was originally planning to try and create an actual story with random characters and see if i could use this as a creative outlet, but instead i have just typed out some of the negative thoughts and things i have done. positively, it has caused me to get a little bit tired, although it is now nearing am, so it is not like if i sleep i wi will getting a worthwhile sleep anyway, so that is fun.. this has also reminded me of my college days, getting up early or staying up late and pounding out an essay the best i can and somehow sti will hoping for a good mark even though it is more than likely a complete mess. i do not even want to think about what a mess this whole thing is, guarantee that it is full of plenty of errors and skipped words where my fingers can not keep up with the brain and i get ahead of myself. if someone other than me ever reads this, i pity you and apologise in advance!	moderate
i do not know what is wrong with me... i was diagnosed with clinical depression years ago now, and i have never quite bounced back. i self isolate but definitely try to reach out to make friends online but that never seems to work out. i am shy, anxious and lonely.. i have autism.. i do not really get social cues and i am a statue in most face to face conversations. the doctors have doubled my medication but honestly i just feel so unwanted and useless.. i have a degree but nowhere wi will accept me. i have interests but i can not seem to find anyone else with the same interests books, music, films i have a passion for writing but i just feel like it is a worthless pursuit that is not taken seriously by others. i just feel like it might be better if i ended it, i am sorry if this is a bit stream of consciousness.. i just feel like i need someone to help 	moderate
childhood abuse trigger warning so i found out last night that i was sexually, physically and emotionally abused as a child ... i was emotionally and somewhat physically abused from . the sexual abuse stopped around when i confronted my mom about it . there were lots of little things like having a nap with my dad when he had just a towel on up until i was . i would have baths with my mom until i was , and other things i thought were normal. i also remember my cousin who is a year younger than me would make me touch her inappropriately and it would make me uncomfortable. i do not know what to say or how to process any of this . my older cousin was also sexually abused by my father . i was clearly psychologically manipulated to idolize my parents and i had no choice but to be good. i can not remember my childhood and almost feel like a liar, why can not i remember anything all of this makes sense as to why i struggle so much as adult. i definitely have some deep levels of trauma. it is just so hard to believe, because to me i am an incredibly functioning adult. i have never lost a job, i have never missed a bi will. i am a harder worker, i am honest and kind and compassionate. i am intelligent. how can i be so functioning??? i have so much anger and resentment and sadness and just so much i do not know what to do with myself. guys i am so sad and i really just needed to vent so i hope you understand.	moderate

feeling alone and invalidated i do not really know what to do anymore. i do not think i have ever truly been stable. ever. my mind is always racing and the anxiety and depression that it brings along with it is really wearing on me as a person and it would been hurting my life for what feels like eternity. i am m and i really do not know what to do anymore. my mood swings are getting really intense and i have started to cut myself more frequently again because i feel like that is the only sort of control i have in my life. my social anxiety is really kicking in again where i freeze and get a blank mind and feel stupid afterwards. it is stupid and i am aware but my mind keeps pushing this agenda where i am not worth it. i went to see a counselor and i felt as though my issues were pushed aside and that i just needed to breath and all would be ok. i have heard this countless ti ames and i find that it never works and i just work myself up. i was sent to my gp by someone else and he wants me to go to a psychiatrist but he does not think anything wi will come of it. what is the point in going then? i just feel really invalidated and i feel like my problems are just not worth anything. he talked about ssri s, not really sure what they are or what they do but i told hi am i would wait and think about taking meds. i feel like i am destined to have a short life. i do not know really what to do anymore and i constantly feel stupid, lonely and unhappy overall with what little potential i have fulfi willed throughout my life.	moderate
life is never ending problems i really want to rest for all of eternity and not have to keep trying to survive for no good reason. i solve one problem and then more of them show up and i have to keep doing this until i die. there is never any permanent state of peace and happiness and i really hate that about life. fuck the chaos, fuck all of the bullshit that makes life suck ass. i keep trying to thistance myself from all of the bullshit in life and escape into my own world but i found it i ampossible because as long as i am alive i am trapped here. life is really fucking depressing the more you look into it and it makes me want to die.	moderate
lonely as fuck. what is the point of being alive in this world? nothing is even worth it anymore. why did i have to be born on this planet? i am too tired to deal with this at this point. i was basically crying myself to sleep last night. so yesterday i was with my homies in class and one thing led to another and we started talking about why i did not have a girlfriend and shit like that, and it later dawned on me. i never had a girl or anything like that. for starters, i am . almost everyone i know is already in a relationship, some get in many. i could just walk down the halls and see a whole bunch of people making out and shit, which it is a high school, you re going to see shit like that every day. but it i ammediately gets me wondering why can not i get shit like that? what is it about myself that makes no one even care about me or love me at all? how hard is it for me to get such a thing that seems so easy for others to have? like what, do these people just go up to random people and ask them out and there we go? it can not be that easy, but everyone else makes it look like it is. i did have many opportunities, that i utterly fucked up. there have been ti ames when i either had girls had a crush on me, which i knew of, or were friends with a girl that i could have had a chance with. one was a girl i met at a softball practice. my nieces used to play softball all the ti ame when they were younger, and used to go to practice, and i would go as well. i met this girl who i became friends with. however, i only saw her like once or twice, and never saw her again. there was also this girl i met at my niece is birthday party, who admitted that she liked me, by writing i love you, chad with chalk in the backyard. now, my name is not chad, just putting it out there, because that would be hilarious if it was, but no, people my whole life always fuck my name up for some reason. those people i met many years ago, however, and i have not seen them since. however, there was this one girl that i knew when i was in eighth grade, that had a crush on me, who i am not going to name for obvious reasons. she would flirt with me all the ti ame, and it basically became a joke with everyone. i could tell you many stories about this, but let us just say it is not family friendly. i should have definitely taken that opportunity, but here is the thing i was incredibly different back then. if you knew me now, and compared how i was back then, i was a whole different person. i was incredibly shy back then, and every ti ame she would flirt, for example like one ti ame she called me daddy in front of everyone, i would always blush and get awkward. that was the difference, now, i know for certain i would have handled that differently and way better than i did back then. i regret not doing anything about that at all. in the beginning, i does not really like her at all, and thought she was just annoying, but something happened. after awhile, i started getting a crush on her as well, and it went from there. it was basically a huge sexual awakening for me, and led to my big problem which i wi will get to soon. i remember i would basically fantasize about being in a relationship with her. now, when i look back, it is cringy as fuck. i handled that extremely wrong. anyways, i remember one ti ame she was mad at me because she thought i liked a girl that i was friends with, even though we were just friends. it is actually kind of hilarious, now that i think about it. but yeah, i basically left eighth grade and went to high school, and she went somewhere else, so there is that one i fucked up on. so, on to high school. i have a huge problem with having a crush on, well, basically every girl i see and know. now, i know that shit is normal, but it is a huge problem for me. it is almost like i just think of girls as objects and not actual people. i could just look at basically every girl and fantasize about having sex with them. it is just annoying at this point. i have some friends that are girls as well, and every single day i see them, i just i amagine having sex with them. it is excruciatingly annoying. i could have a chance with them, but here is the thing it is all just a trap. i could get attached with a girl, and what do you know? they are either in a relationship, or are lesbian. it is almost like there is no chance either way for me. almost everyone in my school is in a relationship, or just si amply do not want me. i have done this many ti ames, i tried what i could to be in a relationship with someone, and it turns out that it is not going to happen. i have done this all the ti ame, and i am basically tired of it. it is obvious i do not care about them as people at all, i obviously do not think of them as something other than objects. i just want my dick wet. i just want to smash, that is all it is. i do not deserve any of these people. i wonder why no one even cares about me at all, but now i know. it is all a joke, i am just put here to be tortured. if there is a god s , they obviously put me here as a joke, to laugh at me. it is all obvious and adds up. they wi will do anything to make my existence terrible. i am not meant for anything other than that. i do not deserve this life, i just want out. i just want to feel like people actually care about me, but that way of living died with my childhood years ago. ever since i left elementary, my life went downhi will. why can not i go back to then? i just want a better life than this.	moderate

i am tired. i am tired of not being able to escape this hell of a life. i am trying to see past my present struggles but it is almost i ampossible to be opti amistic for the future because i can hardly get through the days. i just want to take a break from my life. i am in my last semester of college and i want to drop out. i know that does not make sense but i can not see the end. i have been in college for almost six years because of my depression. thousands of dollars in debt and yet i sti will want to drop out but i know that it is not an option. i have to pretend like i am not suicidal but for what? it does not feel worth it but neither does dropping out and wasting all this ti ame and money with no paper to show for it. if those are my two options, i feel like i am left to just ki will myself because i can not win either way. i just want to escape and abandon my current life completely. leave all of life is responsibilities behind. the pressures of society are too much for me to handle but it is not a choice. there is no hope.	moderate
i just want to feel normal. whatever i am doing, something always feels wrong. if i am alone, i want to be with other people. if i am with other people, i want to be alone. i hate being sad because, well, obvious reasons. i hate being happy, because when i am happy i become annoying and manage to piss everyone off, or get paranoid that i have. i spend the period of ti ame after spending ti ame with people, overthinking about any mistakes i may have made and worrying that everyone hates me. i constantly feel left out even though that just is not true. i just hate it. i do not get how some people can be so good and so comfortable socialising. i hate myself and that makes everyone hate me. i just want to feel normal god damn it.	moderate
so i just tried to ki will myself.. yesterday night one of my best buddys and me were starting a conversation.. i just texted hi am because i was feeling kinda shit and somehow we just got to that point where he litterally just said that i dont want any help and i fucking like to be depressed and that i just want attention.. for explaination, when i sh i someti ames sent a few people pics of that on snapchat because i kinda need someone to see that and i can not live without the cuts being seen.. sounds like an absolute move to get attention ik dont judge me, also i just can not see a doctor ir tell my parents, i just can not.. well,back to te story, he kinda really punched me in the face by saying all that, and it really really really hurt.. well i started feeling really bad and i just wanted to end it, i drank like liters of energydrink at once in the hope of just dying from a hearth attack right now and there, i sat there like an hour and my whole body was shaking like crazy and my muscles cramped a bit.. i am a weird person and i can not cry, even tho i could cry so fucking often i never do, at this moment i kinda cried without a single tear, but all other elements of...well..crying.. i dont even know why i am posting this here, feeling like a fucking attention whore again	moderate

help hey, i do not know why i am typing this but i think i need some help. a man knows where he need help so here i am. i am years old male from jhansi up india i feel kind of numb. i am preparing for mba and i have two interviews lined up and i think this my last chance. i literally do not know that what i am feeling is depression or not but i am finding it difficult to explain. i do not have any problems in my life which are rare for the guy of my age. normal love matters, family issues, career issues. i think for the first ti ame in my life i am feeling restless and can not help it. i think i do not know where is my life heading. i do not know where to start and i am like lost. i have friends, i have girls whom i flirt, i watch porn daily things i used to love , but i do not care about all of these things. i get irritated easily. i shout at my parents and then cry in my room silently. i have never opened up with someone like this, online. i feel empty inside like i do not know what i want to do..what gives my happiness. i get sad very easily which is rare for me bcz being an extrovert. i think people are ignoring me. ignoring my health, ignoring my messages, the people who used to love me are moving on. idk what can i do to let them know that i am sad and feeling so alone and lonely inside. my favorite football team just lost a match liverpool and i am crying about it and its literally new thing for me. i have a big interview on rd march in bhopal days left and i am suffering from cold headache cough and fever. i am so deep down that i have to write an email to whoever it concerns. thank you	moderate
sad loser rants i wi will never be happy, it is my fault, i am aware this is a self fulfi willing prophecy but i just fucked up the best thing i had in my life last night and it was inevitable. i am surprised it took me as long as it did to ruin it. i can have stretches of ti ame where i am a solid person but i am going to fuck up i do so often. i do not know why i even try or have hope that i could sustain a relationship i know i am way too destructive and wi will ruin it. also i am about to graduate college in may and i am fucked, i can not hold a stable job. i have panic attacks out of no where and i can not work during those and i am a dumbass and when i drink i binge to the point where i am completely useless the next day. i do not drink nearly as often as i used to but when i do it is as destructive as ever and i feel like i need some vice someti ames to keep me sane from dealing with my pathetic life. i feel like i can not do anything at all, it is nice out today but i feel trapped in my room, laying on my bed useless just waiting for the day to end. it really seemed like things were getting better and i had hope for the first ti ame in a long ti ame but i ruined that. the thing is it is not like i am unlucky, i am the problem, i have been so lucky and put into so many great situations to find happiness but i have ruined everything. i know i wi will always have these problems in my life because i am the problem and that wi will never change.	moderate
so i just got home from going out for the first ti ame in my life, and i felt thisconnected and empty and felt like crying fake the entire ti ame. so i did not thought i was depressed but i am m and i have rly low self esteem, and i started a new job last october. today my coworkers had a go out and eat and do some bowling so i joined them, since i got no friends and it is a good thing to go out and challenge my social anxiety. i went, and they all laughed and had a good ti ame. i felt so thisconnected and lonely and empty the entire ti ame. i had thoughts like how can they think this is so fun etc. one of my coworkers when we did bowling, when i missed or did a bad go, or when i lost the round. she told me aww, we playing for fun , nice try etc. it just feels like she feel sorry for me and it sucks. i been doubting my ability on my job lately as well, and on the way home i said something like i want to see if i get a full ti ame job here, when my trial ends in september, before i move to x city and one of them said very carefully hopefully you get to stay while, the rest was quite. a second before we talked about that, my other coworker in the backseat said she hopes she gets to stay, and all in the car agreed, and made sure she wi will. what am i experiencing?	moderate
i just feel so empty i thought i was finally getting better. but i think i might be at one of my lowest points. everything just doesnt matter anymore. i can not even talk to anyone about it irl because ik that nobody would care. my life is just so pointless.	moderate
job loss and depression basically i was let go without warning a few weeks ago. i took some ti ame and took a trip, filed for unemployment and escalated my case up and came to a mutual agreement that was positive with my company. this experience has to say the least, wrecked me emotionally. i did not love my workplace but the income, benefits, and overall atmosphere was always enough. i poured myself into making this job and atmosphere better and at the end they just devalued and wiped it away in a phone call that was less than minutes. i hit the ground running, sent out applications l i have sat interviews and just a few setbacks have me really depressed. i have a part ti ame that is helping me stay afloat and have been putting in apps like crazy but i feel so sad and anxious, especially today. i filed for unemployment so i was counting on that but now there is a thiscrepancy that means they have to review and i am terrified they wi will thisqualify me for some reason which wi will mean i wi will be destitute almost until i find a new job i wi will know on monday. how do you stay motivated through adversity such as job loss? what are some good tricks and tips to try? i keep getting overwhelmed about finances, about everything. i also just got a new partner whose been supportive but i feel guilty putting hi am through this experience so early on and it is making me withdraw from hi am. i am trying to focus on starting a travel company etc but i have not slept well and have started having panic attacks randomly for the first ti ame in years. i just need some help or reassurance, thanks for your ti ame.	moderate
it is not fucking normal i always hear shit like i know what you feeling, we have all been there, we have been sad. shut the fuck up please, it is not normal to be up until am everynight listening to sad music whilst crying. i can not relate to your bullshit. sure we all get sad someti ames, but most people do not feeling like constantly feel like bashing their head against the wall until it hurts to much. i do not need anyone to relate too, i just want this sadness to thisappear.	moderate
i have ran out of love and fucks to give and honestly that seems to be my destiny i was such a happy person once even though life was shitty. there was inexplicable hope in me and the wi will to do good. i have supported so many people through bad ti ames because it made me feel better that at least others could feel better than me. now i have lost all my hope and can not fight the feeling that the world is a dark and unforgiving place and people wi will never learn their lesson. there is so much evil out there and i am so sick of trying to convince others not to be assholes to each other and just sucking up the pain others cause me because i am understanding like that and know that everyone just tries their very best every day. but there is no one for me. i have a family, a partner and a few friends but i do not think they really care. my once best friend who i have supported throughout his depression turned his back on me because of a girl. it honestly hurts so fucking much, he haunts me in my dreams. he is ditched me for the same person in the past and i have managed to accept it and even feel happy for hi am being in a happy relationship. they broke up a few months later though and he is told me how toxic the relationship has been and how sorry he was for treating me how he did. and now he did it again, consciously, after knowing how much it hurt the first ti ame, without any warning just cut me off. even worse while i am at the perhaps darkest spot in my life so far. that is what i get for accepting and supporting hi am unconditionally. it hurts just so fucking much. my parents can not even stop drinking for once fucking afternoon where i visit them and wi will insult me etc. they have not changed one bit since i was a teenager, they are stuck in their toxic patterns and probably wi will be forever. and i sti will help them as best as i can with paperwork, cleaning etc. like the fucking doormat i am. you can not choose family, right? who wi will i be left with if i stop doing this? extended family is dead or does not speak to me since i was a kid anyway. i try not to think about my relationship too much because it would make me cry. i have supported hi am through every hardship he is faced. he tries to do the same but... he can not really understand me, someti ames he does not try and gets fed up with me, tells me off or brushes off what i say. i know i have turned into such a negative person that he can not take it anymore. i am dragging hi am down like people in my life have dragged me down and left me drowning alone. i am not sure he loves me anymore, i am not even sure i love hi am. he is the last straw. i am left with nothing if he leaves. my life is falling apart. i am supposed to go to therapy soon but i doubt it wi will help. there seems to be something wrong with me as a person. it is probably my loss to be like that i am from a broken poor toxic family, i am destined to be like that forever. our world and society is not for people like me. i am a born loser.	moderate
i am i living my life wrong? this morning way before people had woken up, it is saturday and people tend to sleep more on the weekend. yeah so i checked facebook and found myself on classmates pages for years ago. most of them are in relationships, many have hit married and kids, some are not married but gut kids. do not do not have any education, just high school. and here you got me i have never been in a relationship, i have never be b the type of person being in a relationship just for the sake of being in one. i am also not the type of person that get in love easy at all. i have never had the feeling of oh i want kids someday, i want to be a mother in the future no, since my early childhood i have always said i wi will never want kids til this day i do not want kids. my parents know it and my friends too. i have even told my parents i wi will get the surgery to cut my eggs or i wi will hav my future partner do it. since my early childhood i have been loving school and studying. guess what? i am sti will studying and love it, i am working too, but i study full ti ame, and i am all invested in it. but while i was at facebook and til now i am thinking am i doing something horribly wrong, am i living my life wrong, am i wasting my life, should i stop and just find myself a partner to marry and have kids soon? this overwhelmed me and i got so emotional that i cried for myself and got this lump in my stomach. i know life is not a competition of who get to get things or whatever the fastest. but i just can not accept this right now, i want to and i believe in it, but i just can not make myself to accept it right now as my head is full of am i ruining my life? have i been wrong all my life til now? even people younger than me have husbands and wife is and kids. an inner voice inside of my head was saying i am probably going to die lonely, but i do not want to die alone i am heading to a really deep dark place if i do not pull myself out of it...	moderate
i need help i think i need to tell someone about how i am depressed so that i can get help. i honestly think that if i do not get any, i might just go ahead and ki will myself soon. thing is, i do not know who to tell or how to tell them. i have considered going to the school counselor, but i am a bit afraid if i tell them i am suicidal they might call the cops on me or something and i can not deal with that. i can not tell my father, as i know that he wi will just thismiss me as an attention seeker or something. he is said before in the past that he thinks that any teenager that says that they are suicidal are just punks and that if i ever told hi am that, he would give me the gun to shoot myself with. pretty sure the last part was a joke, but he was serious about the first bit so i do not want to tell hi am. i have considered telling my sister since she might understand, but i do not want to bother her since she is on a vacation with her boyfriend. this leaves my mother. i am afraid to tell her, but she is the best option i think. i have tried telling her before, but she did not take me seriously. that is my fault, though, since i could not work up the courage to say it seriously and said it a bit jokingly as a defense mechanism, i guess. but i can not work up the courage to say it seriously to her face, and i wouldn t know what to say if i could. does anyone have any advice for how to approach telling her and what i could say? i really need help	moderate

kinda scared of myself? i was in a pretty bad state of mind a few months years ago idk for sure if it was depression cause my parents never cared enough did not notice and therefore never sent me to a psychologist and had suicidal thoughts, and the usual why am i even alive , i can not accomplish anything and my existence is unnecessary battles in my head. no self harming, thank god i moved out in october last year and have been pretty great so far. did not have a serious breakdown in that ti ame. but i am really scared of my next big attack. when it wi will be, how strong it wi will be. if that wi will be the thing to break all my barriers. every ti ame i hold a knife in my hand i i amagine stabbing myself with it. i do not know why. i am in a happy mood. i just try to shake it off and go on, but it kinda sticks. i never lost my self control, but i am really afraid of the one ti ame i wi will. thanks for reading my ramble, haha.	moderate
dropping out of school hi. i am and i have suffered with severe depression my entire life. i grew up in an abusive house so i never ever was allowed to address mental health. i took me years out of my house to even start any type of therapy. i recently started regular therapy which is helpful. but things are very very bad this last year, i am in a down period just what i always called my severe depressive episodes and though i have experienced many down periods the extent of this one has not been felt since i was sti will stuck at home. it is taking over everything i can not eat, i cry just being up , have anxiety attacks when i have to leave my room, etc. most of all i am unable to a make it to class and b complete any of my course work bc i literally just can not focus or remember anything. i am very confident in my intelligence but it is just back to the same things as high school , my brain feels empty when i try to do anything. i think i need to drop out of school so i can focus on therapy and figuring out myself bc i can not live this way anymore i have been fighting and repressing for so long and i am just too weakened now. i am just not sure if it is the right thing to do. everyone i know who does not have these issues says i should just keep trying bc i am so close to graduating next semester . idk if i can do it right now. i just need some support i guess , i do not have anyone to turn to except my therapist and that feels so sad to me....	moderate
i am so physically and mentally drained i recently deactivated my facebook account to break myself away from social media. i made a plan on going to a tattoo shop today to talk about a back piece i would like and i asked multiple people if they could come with me so i am not alone. when i am alone in public, my anxiety is at an all ti ame high because i do not know what is going to happen and i can not prepare for it. i refuse to go to the gym because i hate when people stare at me and going to work and being surrounded by a crap ton of people does not help at all. so, right now, i am crying in bed thinking how much of a waste of space i am and how i even have a boyfriend who barely texts me i do not mind. he has his own life . i have seen a psychiatrist and their diagnosis is general anxiety. just a couple sessions with no medication for now and future use and i would be all good. i am honestly trying my hardest to stay positive and try and get out of bed, but i can not. i can not go out and explore the state i am in because i have no motivation to leave my bed	moderate
my dreams made me realize i am mentally i will and in need of help. since the age of , i kept doing si amilar dreams about my chilhood current future house. so, i keep dreaming since the age of about my childhood house, wich i lived in since i was born, to the age of . at the age of i always dreamed about the same scene, were i was alone outside the building were my apartment was, in a park next were was the canal that ran through the neighborhood across the street. i was just wandering outside admiring my ancient neighborhood, and i always woke up nostalgic and kinda sad. the weather was always nice, everything was green, it felt like the middle of summer during school break. then, dream that stopped these identical dreams was the one where i finally entered my appartement. bassicaly the whole building was somehow destroyed as if there had been a fire . the ceiling gave seen on the sky, since our my apartment was in the last floor. it was terrifying. after that, the last ti ame i saw my childhood building house was in a apocalyptic atmosphere where the ruins became some sort of shelter were people i did not know where hiding. bewteen this dream and the next one related to houses i iive lived in, it was basically just nightmares were i hanged myself, fighting violently with my family, and harming myself, over and over again, at a point were i was afraid to go to sleep . then, the dream about my current house. it was last year, and it showed me, in the third person, sleeping in the living room since i could not sleep in my own room irl. there was brambles coming out of my body and strangling to death my family members. it was during the period were my mental health was getting really bad. because of it and my abusive dad, i did not know what was real or not anymore memory loss . i feared that everything was my fault and that i was lying on what happened to me. week ago, i dreamed about moving out with my family in a house. and yesterday i dreamed about moving out sti will with my family to my supportive aunt is old city. i had mixed feelings about it. and... that is it. i just wanted to share these dreams. and eventually see if anybody here had a si amilar experience. it made me realize what was heppening to me was not normal, and that i was going completely insane. i think it is both amazing and horrifying, that these identical dreams kept portraying the state of my mental health trough years, and helped me understand my emotions and my needs. at least that is how i personally see it. when i was , it was depression, that i am sti will trying to recover from to this day, then it became c ptsd, a result of my abusive parents and my seizures that kept getting worst since my situation never changed. i am also suffering from some sort of amnesia i forgot most of my childhood. that is why it made me so happy to see my childhood house. and, the reason i remember some memory and dreams is that i wrote a diary, since i forget everything.	moderate

 m feeling down whassup y all? for the past days i have been pissed because a friend of mine made a comment to me, it was more like being interrogated more and a ways of my sexual orientation, it is because i do not have a lot of sexual history. i go to bars, parties, and the internet, but i choose not push myself into sex until the right person comes along. i really want to have a good income, and i am looking for maturity. anyway back to the topic, i was talking to someone and she suddenly ghosts me, but i have not talked to hi am in a while. i had been down due to my job, and i have seen how better off they are. we had talked about that, but we talked about why i thistanced myself from them, and every ti ame i am around them they talk about how many bitches they fuck, and how much money they make and the extravagant lifestyle they have, and why i am sti will single, and then i was asked if i was gay and i was pissed and offended by that. that was like a cheap shot, and it is because i never was into sports, and it was my taste in music, movies, television and my choice of being to myself. i have nothing against gays but i never had no luck with females, but i do admit i am a little jealous of their lifestyles and i wish i had some kind of stability in my own life. i decided to stay to myself because of that. 	moderate

i am a depressed anxious suicidal autistic kid hi y all. i am joey and i am y o. i have been suffering from depression, anxiety and ocd for about years now. i also have autism. i am currently getting help at school and i am having therapy. it seems fine on paper but i have been thinking a lot about suicide lately. it does not seem to i amprove. i am numb all the ti ame and can not seem to do anything nor talk to anyone. i do not have any friends and never receive messages. i have not gone school for about of the year so far and never felt relief or true hapiness in these past years. as a y o kid in the netherlands, you have to attend school. you need to until you re . i feel isolated and lonely. being my age and having autism makes it hard for me to maintain a strong bond with someone. most people my age do not understand feeling depressed. i have told almost everyone i talk to on a daily basis about my mental health and why i am not at school. about of them which were both girls seemed to care... for less then a month. suicide seems like the answer even though i know it is not. something inside me wants to make my friends and family be fi willed with pain. that is the only way i know they cared about me. i would set an example for them. one that would show them how precious one single soul is and that they should be kind and talk to someone who seems sad and or lonely.	moderate
dealing with my past in a current relationship tw rape, ptsd, depression so i was raped by one of my exes. it was my first proper relationship, he was the one i lost my virginity to consensually , however he took advantage of that and raped me on two separate occasions . i am currently with an amazing man who i love to absolute pieces and would never ever dream of breaking up with. he is the one as they say. the only problem is, i keep getting flashbacks of my rape. like i can feel my ex on top of me someti ames, or i can see his face just floating around, and it is so scary and sends me into panic mode. idk what to do. i feel like such a huge burden on hi am because he has to deal with my constant panic attacks whenever it happens. i hate it so much. i do not know what to do. i am depressed and i have anxiety too, and i spi will my problems to hi am when it all gets too much. i am not sure what to do anymore.	moderate
what is the point? i am a year old in the smallest town ever. i have one friend that i barely see. like she always talks about seeing me but puts it off cause she does not want to clean. i lost my other friend group cause they either thought i was annoying or because the person who introduced me to the group broke up with me so they did not want to hang out with the ex anymore. i work a mini amum wage job where the majority of workers are mean to me and i have not made any friends from the job. i do online school but can not go back to my old school due to my abusive ex attending there. i have insomnia as well so it would be nearly i ampossible to get up that early for classes. my parents and i have no relationship even though we live in the same house. my plan is to get on meds, go to college, and move out but it feels incredibly far away and i am sick of hanging on for the same boring pointless day over and over again.	moderate
what now? where do you go when you feel like everything is ending? i had a job i loved. i was technically a supervisor, i thought i was doing alright. . i had a review some ti ame ago, was told all was great. i was doing a good job. recently i was told i am no longer supervisor. they do not believe i am good enough. i went from being perfect to being crap with absolutely no indication in between things were getting bad. the manager told me all this face to face, and i thought okay. fair enough. maybe i do need support. but then she left me a letter, basically telling me that she wi will be watching and if i do not i amprove i wi will be fired. this is bullshit, putting it nicely. i was only told i was lacking in the areas needed to be a supervisor, now she is telling me i am crap at my job in general. so ... stacking shelves, the si amplest job, and i can not even do that right. i thought i would hit rock bottom when she told me i was not supervisor any more. but no ... now i know my job is on the line. my flat, my car, everything i own is on the line if i lose this job. and it turns out there is a giant pit below rock bottom. my sister in law is due to give birth any day now, but i feel so goddamn numb. i have spent several days over with her and my brother, just in case, just waiting for my little niece to arrive, and all i can think is they have achieved this. my brother is now doing great, she is having a baby. and me? i can not even stack shelves . my dad is visiting as well, and in the ti ame i have hung out with them i feel like an outsider. he laughs at her jokes, talks to her, plays ps with my brother, talks to hi am ... me? i just sit there feeling isolated. i try. i made a few jokes, only for everyone to ignore me. someone else makes the same joke a second later and everyone is laughing. i am on holiday for a week from work right now, and have had a couple of interviews. one i thought went really well. i did not get it. today i had another. i know i did not get that either. but it does not surprise me. when you manage to go below rock bottom, i guess there is no way out. i belong here. as nothing. as a failure. all i need is for someone to fi will the damn hole in and forget about me. and i am sure they wi will ... my mum and dad wi will have a granddaughter. my brother wi will have a daughter. who needs me anyway? the failure of the family. i am so numb right now.	moderate

i am losing my mind hi there reddit. i never thought i would turn to an internet group for help no offence , but after years and years of trying to get a sense of control in my life, i do not know who i can really turn to anymore. i hope its not an issue, but i wi will need to give some backstory, so here goes. i have been overweight nearly my entire life. i found it harder and harder to control my eating as i got older and got my hands on money for fast food , and even as a child i can remember fighting with my parents because they wanted me to eat the child portions at restaurants. ten years and hundreds of diets down the line, i have completely lost control of my eating to a level that i am spending hundreds of pounds a month on fast food. even over the last three days, i have eaten two or three sandwiches at lunch each day, chocolate, crisps etc etc. i have had two massive dominoes, mcdonald is and kfc, each ti ame to a point where i am so full i feel i will and tonight made myself throw up a pounds dominoes order worth of pizzas, chicken and cookies. i have tried what feels like hundreds of ti ames to lose weight, and lost nearly pounds in the summer, was really beginning to feel as though i was doing something meaningful and that i was going to escape the pain of being obese, before a friend who i wi will talk about later cut me off and my eating and exercise just collapsed. this collapse in my healthy mindset caused me to flunk my a levels, and lost a place at a top university in the world for history, going from motivated to barely even wanting to go to university. the same goes for my drinking, where i often have been so drunk at parties that i have passed out and broken people is stuff, at one point i think i slapped someones butt and basically shamelessly hit on them in front of people and sti will feel awful for doing something that i thought i could never bring myself to do, realising in retrospect i drink to change how people perceive me, from an introvert to this outgoing, funny guy who loves to party. i am not a regular drinker, but when i drink, i drink to a level that i am throwing up everywhere in my own home as i am drinking a whole bottle of vodka on my own. i have been romantically fucked my whole teenage life. i am , gay and the only action i think i ever had was with a guy who did it to steal weed out of my back pocket while we were kissing, and have aspects to my sexuality that honestly make me want to ki will myself. due to my sexuality and my weight i learnt to hate myself, and became so depressed that in february of i tried to hang myself with a belt, but the hanger i was using snapped due to my weight, so ironically i owe my life to my obesity. when i opened up to friends, many of them fell away from me, thistancing themselves from the crazy kid. i ended up forming unhealthy relationships with some of the only people that stayed with me through my struggles, which caused them to fall away from me. most notably, i fell in love with a boy in my year at boarding school extremely heavily due to the fact that i perceived hi am as my saviour as on many occasions he wouldn t leave me alone because he knew i was ready to ki will myself at the ti ame . losing that friend was the catalyst to allowing my diet to fall apart, and whilst i wish hi am the best in life, i can not help but feel that if he would just held on a few more months, i could be healthy and happy now. now i am working a job i hate in a country i desperately want to leave. i am anxious, i am afraid of my own mind and feel like i would not ever be able to lose weight. i just wish i did not exist anymore to be honest, and the things i felt so passionate about, mainly shooting i shot for england as a teen , and aviation, have all slid away and i feel alone and lost without anybody to truly talk to. there are so many things i desperately want to tell people but i just can not bring myself to. after losing my friends at school due to my mental health, i have put up walls around myself where i am naturally suspicious of everybody and so would not tell them how i feel. all i have left is my dream just to leave everything behind and move to the country in america, somewhere like oregon where i could find a friend in nature, at least, and be able to leave my lb, romantically desolate and depressed life behind me.	moderate

cleaning the depression mess in your home when depressed and overwhelmed tip for anyone looking i just recent learned this the hard way and was able to clean out about years worth of depression mess from my home. get the clear garbage bags the ones often used for collecting leaves and whatever area you are starting in if it is garbage it goes in a regular black bag and if you are keeping it it goes in the clear bag. it makes it way easier to get through the clutter and mess when you are starting out and you do not have a spot to put the keep items. often that is what i found to be so overwhelming i was just moving things from one spot to another and never felt like i was getting anywhere. then once your place is emptied of the garbage and your floor is finally visible and you can vacuum sweep wash it you can put the clear bags in the rooms they should be in and then empty them one bag at a ti ame.	moderate
about a year or so ago i was warned not to shave my head because you re depressed and you ll end up making it worse. i worked in a hospital around this ti ame and i was badly depressed. i wanted to die and i just felt stuck. constantly screwing up, not moving forward of getting better at anything. it was a toxic environment that i did not fit into and i was drowning. a friend got diagnosed with cancer and i was wi willing to shave my head in show of support. our tutor at the hospital, who had tired to help me in the past, called me one night and told me it was not a good idea to shave my head. she told me of someone her husband knew who was depressed and that lady shaved her head. but the sudden drastic change made things worse and this woman ended up committing suicide. this scared me and i left my hair long. but i hated it. i felt like it was choking me but i was too afraid of the effect it would have. months ago i started cutting my hair short. shaved sides, long on top and i felt nothing. it was not scary. it was relief. i began to enjoy the shortness. today i attended a shaveathon a local cancer initiative. you pay r and the either shave your hair for you, or spray it with colour . i shaved all my hair off down to a and i am not super happy about it, but i also dont feel like it is going to send me into a spiral. i am probably in the same bad emotional space as i was back then, but it surprises me how little i actually care. the hair wi will grow back and i dont feel different. i just feel numb.	moderate
i thought being in a relationship plus make me happier... i have had depression my entire life, never actually been diagnosed, but i am pretty sure it is clinical. someti ames i just get extremely depressed for absolutely no reason. i just feel it seeping in. anyways, before i met the women who is now my wife i was seriously depressed, constantly considering suicide, and turned into a recluse. i always thought it was because i had only had one girlfriend and all of my friends were always in and out of relationships and sleeping around, so i thought that i was just a fat ugly piece of shit. i thought that if i ever did meet a girl my depression would just magically go away. so, here i am, years into our relationship, been married years, and it is back in full force. we re a single income family we a year old daughter and she is beautiful and i work my absolute ass off, so that my wife and daughter can have the best life possible. but it does not seem to matter what i do or how hard i work. my wife is constantly pissed off and depressed because of our living situation. i work probably hours a week and i even started college so that i could get a better job. i currently make dollars k a year, which seems like good money, but not for people to live off of. i give them both what ever they want, when ever they want it. my wife has a far better vehicle than me, brand new iphone , i always get her jewelry and makeup, and let her get pretty much what ever she wants. i do t have much myself, but i do not really care. it does not seem to matter what i do she just acts like she is miserable. i offered to pay for her schooling if she did not want to be a stay at home mom, but she says that is all she wants to do. i dropped out of college because i thought that was stressing her out. sti will miserable. i am f ing exhausted and depressed as crap and there is nothing i can do to make our lives better. and she acts like it is all on me. sorry this is so long. i wi will stop ranting now.	moderate

i have kind of accepted it i think i managed to accept that i wi will ki will myself one day, might take or years, but i sincerely believe that that is how it wi will all end. depression does not really affect me like it used to. i can get out of bed, do my chores, go to university and all that. but i really see no prospect for me, all the ideas of getting a family or a good job seem i ampossible and far fetched. the only possible future that i can see is ki willing myself after my mother dies, because she is the only thing keeping me here, i do not wish to cause her pain.	moderate
lonely and depressed i am extremely lonely and depressed these days. i have got nobody to talk to and even if i did i would be too embarrassed. i have lost so many friends over this past year. i isolate myself from everyone. my old friends used to reach out but eventually got tired of my ignoring them. can not blame them. but most days i never want to leave the house or reply back talk etc. when i finally do make myself leave the house i regret it i ammediately and my one desire is to go right back home and not leave my bed. i just do not know what to do anymore. like i can not be mad about my situation because it is all my fault. i can not expect to have people in my life when i ignore everyone and isolate myself from the world. since y all are all a bunch of strangers and it can be done from my phone in bed it is easy to talk about right now and it honestly feels good. glad to finally get this off my chest	moderate
someti ames i am so lonely it hurts to breathe i have been alone the vast majority of my thirty some years on this earth. if you did not know me you, you might assume i am a loner...but i am not. i have always craved social interaction, but as far back as i can remember i have always been on the outside looking in. i just never really fit in no matter what i tried. my own cousins would talk shit about me to me mind you and leave me out of things they did. i would occasionally make friends, but i thistinctly remember my first friend that i can remember at least who was my neighbor, telling me at school that i could not talk hang out with her because her friends thought i was weird never did specify exactly why, possibly just my age as i was a kindergartner and i think my friend was in second grade so we could only be friends at home not at school. throughout life i had friends that would do that. in fourth grade i even had a bully end up with me in the nurses office i was sick, she hurt her ankle on the playground and start being really nice to me, which confused the shit out of me...until she apologized about always being mean to me, but she had to because they did not like me, and that she actually thought i was cool. same thing in th grade, i was bullied on the bus but had become close friends with one of the other two kids who were at my stop....the kids on the bus wanted her to push me out of the seat next to her, and afraid they would fuck with her she made up a lie about her mom knowing mine and getting in trouble if she did it. neither of us talked to the boy, but on a different day i sat next to hi am because there were no other spots and he had never said or done anything to me. however the kids on the bus did much the same thing as to my friend only in this case asked hi am if he was okay with me sitting by hi am to which he responded with an angry tirade about me and how he wished i would sit somewhere else but doing that would have meant sitting next to someone who would physically hurt me anyways shit like that happened a lot, i even made really close friends with a few popular people....who is friends would hate me and constantly ask them why they put up with me. although they would respond si amply with i was fine cool whatever...the friends who constantly talk shit and they never really got in between, just kept being friends with me. moving forward, even my best friend in highschool was a shady bitch i knew she could be shady, i did not realize how bad until later when i reconnected with one of the two friends i have now who let me know all the shit she used to talk about me which was later confirmed by other people i had not really known in highschool but ran into after. one of my bfs in highschool, who was super cocky but not even that special was embarrassed about being with me, despite constantly tonguing his ex everywhere they went...so sufficed to say i have social anxiety, and self esteem that is in the negatives. i ignored the bullying as far as telling any adults and internalized everything by spending pretty much every waking minute i was not at school sleeping, and when i was at school, reading to escape and try to ignore the shit talking. i never really figured out what it is about me that is wrong, besides being shy and quiet. i try to be nice, try to ask people questions about themselves, talk about things i know their interested in but even as an adult i just have some acquaintances, and literally two people i can call friends. recently i finally found the courage to admit how bad i am to my doctor and she stated me on an antidepressant anti anxiety meds. i have been on it for about a month, and it is been helping a lot. i have been able to start getting things done, and i have found it a bit easier to talk at work without over thinking everything so much that by the ti ame i figure out what to say the conversations moved too far past that point. one of the biggest stresses struggles in my life is a lack of friends. i am constantly stuck home alone with no one to talk to, or go out and do things with. i actually thought i hit the jackpot recently...i came across a post on the marketplace from someone who moved to the area and was looking to make friends with people who had mutual interests, all of which were things i love to do. so i sent a si ample message saying i saw her post and thought i would reach out. i saw that she saw the message but she did not respond. i decided to just give up, but one of the only two friends i have said maybe she just did not know how to respond so send her another message actually mentioning options for things we could do, so i did. i mentioned an event coming up in a couple weeks that fit what she in theory would like. i was excited when she responded that she had been interested but could not find my message and was glad i reached out, so i went ahead and friended her since she had issue friending me, and told her what i i had done. however it seems as soon as she accepted the friend request she blocked me. which is whatever, she for whatever reason was obviously just not interested in trying to form a friendship with me, and i would rather find out now rather then keep hoping it could lead to a friendship that just was not going to happen....but it just feels bad. someone who was looking actively for friends, rejected me so hard she felt the need to block me. i even said if she was not interested that was fine i just wanted to offer. i feel absolutely pathetic that i only have two friends, who i rarely ever see, and barely even talk to. i used to feel like i was second best, i was always second to someone else even in relationships. second best to my sibling, but lately i feel like i have moved back to th place. no matter what method i try, i just can not seem to make a friend. about a year ago i realized the only ti ame people spoke to me is when i reached out to them first. my two friends are the only ones who reached out again on their own. i have tried contacting and getting together with people i would have considered my friends to hang out at some point, but after constantly getting told no for whatever reason, or getting bailed on at the last minute and never hearing from them again....i stopped trying. i just wish i knew what was fucking so terrible about me that no one wants to ever be friends with me. even with my family i do not hear from them unless i am reaching out. i know they love me, they just do not like me. i can not help feeling like a huge pathetic loser. i am sitting here bawling my eyes out, sick to my stomach, because damn i am just a useless, worthless pile of shit that no one can stand to be around. i even went so far as never talking about my issues depression and always put on a happy face. i was told by someone who had started talking to me less and less that i was just too depressing and it seemed to help some, i was able to make acquaintances. it was sti will only ever that, si ample his and small talk...never anything of substance. i just wish i knew what was wrong with me, so i could stop being alone. having a mild panic attack, because i am a loser who can not make friends. even people who are looking for friends do not want to talk to me 	moderate

it sucks to be a teen with depression anxiety because everyone assumes you re just attention seeking and do not know what true mental thisorders are like. when you re ages and the topic of mental health comes up in conversation, if you say you have depression they i ammediately assume you do not know what the hell you re talking about. if you reveal anything to adults, their i ammediate train of thought is you re a kid, you do not even have to work yet. what is there to worry about in school? gee, i wish i was your age again because everything was so si ample back then. kids these days complain about the smallest things... and etc. this attitude is exacerbated by the teens who jump on the mental health is now trendy bandwagon. they self diagnose as depressed because every so often they get a bit sad or lazy. the kids who self harm not as a coping mechanism but as a means of getting attention piss me off the most. feel free to downvote, i know self harm is a serious issue and i used to do it too, but i am talking about the ones who do it purposely in visible places and are not actually suffering from mental i willness. i am never the first one to talk about my experiences with mental health, but if it comes up in conversation, i someti ames feel the need to clarify that i was diagnosed by a professional because so many teens are self diagnosing using those bs mental health tests online, then using those scores to show off. it is embarrassing. welp, that was my generalized rant about feeling marginalized as an actually depressed teen.	moderate

i want it to be okay for me to be unhappy. obviously i do not want to be unhappy. i do not want to be depressed, or miserable. i do not like any of this, and i do not want my family and friends to just be fine with me being like this necessarily. what i mean is though, is that often it feels like, with the way they react, it is not so much that they think it is bad that i am unhappy, but that they think i am bad for being unhappy. as if i am the problem, the only problem here. i do not have a problem that needs to be addressed, i am the problem that needs to be addressed. i am just kind of tired of it. i want it to be okay, even if not all the ti ame, just someti ames. i just want to be able to be negative, and miserable, and depressed, and anxious and know that i am sti will loved and cared about even as i am those things. instead i feel like i am not loved, people just angry, they get annoyed, they want me to put on the fake, cheery mask, because that mask is just so much better than the real me. i hate that mask, i hate it so very, very much. someti ames i think the me in the mirror is that mask and i want to hurt hi am badly because everyone loves hi am so much more even though he is so very fake. this is probably all just wishful thinking though, nobody wants to put up with somebody negative. so i either have to pretend for the affection i want or be honest and be alone.	moderate
new i have watched countless reddit videos about many topics but i only created this account to talk about my depression to vent . currently, my family is not only unsupportive of getting help but as a college student i can not afford it. when i was a toddler i remember grabbing a knife and holding it t my stomach and saying i was one day going to end it. as a child i would make myself cry just to feel anything and naturally i began to self harm but stopped a few years ago. my friends know i have depression but i dont know if they know how bad it is, i have a good life, good people surround me and an incredible partner but i dont have anything that makes me want t live at ti ames. i dont want to ki will myself but i often wish i was never born or hope i can die saving some one at least that would have a valid reason.	moderate
just another note on depression i do not even know why i am writing here, but it felt like the only place i could put things out at the moment. it is a note i wrote today during fighting some inner demons. this may not be depression, it may be a mild life fog, but i am no doctor to say. constructive feedback and not are welcome. thanks for passing by. i think i am going through some depression. i wi will clarify. i am healthy, in my s, within the norm, i have a well paid job, a mostly healthy family, good childhood, some friends here and there. i am not busy, or burned out, i do what i need to do and i end up with free ti ame in my hands too. why do you even complain? would say the practical brain. there is no complaint in stating the state of your mind. it is a fact, it may change depending on dayti ame or weather, but it is sti will the current reality. the point of me diagnosing myself with depression is to face the problem. i wake up, bit in a rush, head to work, and start my day looking at the faces of other people, in a struggle, hopefully questioning themselves why are they in that metro at that ti ame, going to a place they do not necessarily like. i project these thoughts from my head to theirs. we are a silent and separated unity. i end up looking like them, i feel part of them, but i have no way to get in touch with them and empathize. no way to share the communal pain. i spend the rest of the day in an office, doing what i need, even having just a bit of fun someti ames, solving problems, fixing things. no stress. also, no real connection with people, everyone is there because they have to, not by real choice. thiscussions are superficial and filtered, it is sti will work, we need to keep a good i amage and a good face. people are not struggling together, they are struggling individually. the work day finished, and i am head quickly out, maybe i manage to see a nice sky, that i amproves morale, but soon it is metro ti ame. same faces, same questions. back home i cook something si ample, say hi to my really nice flatmate, we both are quiet people. it is dark outside, and i should make a decision social or home. the social decision is hard, meaning going out again, facing another trip or two, having to drink something, having to find an interesting conversation or activity. better not, i wi will stay home. questions that i left early in the morning, re emerge quickly. some music and videos wi will keep them silent. ti will it is bedti ame. it is dark and quiet, i may have done some sport during the day, i may be tired physically, my brain is awake. it is just a matter of getting lost in my internal thiscussion, hoping that the mammal physiological behavior wi will make these thoughts into a dream soon. it wi will be easier to digest. maybe it wi will take some ti ame. it is friday. i am done with work, i wi will have many hours free before any real duty wi will come up to me. social actions are again needed. i am not feeling ready, i do not feel the drive, the reasons, the pleasure to meet. i feel i try to force myself into it. i should go out. i should meet some people. maybe some new inputs, some new character wi will enter my life, things may change without me realizing it. saturday evening, i am sti will in bed from the day before, i did not move much, i cleaned a bit. i cooked for myself, si ampler, faster. i got some invitations to pubs, music, houses. i kindly refuse. i am not ready, i do not find the drive, the motivation. my stream of thoughts is sti will there, perpetual. it is almost like a song, words repeat, first verse, second verse, chorus. i know them well, i can sing along. all this would be solved. if only. i could be in a better state. i could feel part of a group. i could have one or two close friends, physically and mentally, to whom to speak. i would feel they understand me. i would help them too, i would feel part of a collective of minds. i could have a partner. i could have a partner next to me. with si amilar questions, to go through together. embracing the problems, being open, no filters needed. but this did not happen in the past and is not happening sti will. where are you? where is the part of me outside of me that sti will i did not meet. is there any? years are passing by. i may be on the late train, closing ti ame. i may have missed it already, i may be missing it in years or so. the state of mind certainly reduces the possibilities of catching the ride. we are social ani amals, we search for a clan, a family circle. if we find it and accept it, we are well off. if we do not, are there sti will going to be people around us like us? we may be all too far from each other to see each other in the real world. near physically. i think i am depressed. something is unresolved in my psychology. i can and did turn it off in the past, and sti will do. it always re emerge. i left partners because they were not what i was looking for. because i was focusing on my issues, my battles, they were not part of it. i left places, lost connections with nice people. i went on, as i am meant to. now i am sti will here. i think i am depressed. i think many people are around me. but we are all into this individually, somehow collectively alone.	moderate
it is hilarious that i am expected to be a functioning part of society. the same society that fucking wants me dead. well they have got their wishes because i am honestly dead already. everything that made me who i am is gone. all what is left is a shadow of my physical body, and pain. how, and why am i supposed to be productive? every moment is infernal. i do not want to live through it anymore. i can not reason why i should go on longer. maybe one day i wi will snap and my survival instincts wi will fade away and i wi will do what i should have done years ago. i hope. because i am not supposed to be here.	moderate

it would not end. took indica edibles last wednesday and felt amazing as usual but this ti ame the feeling lingered. come friday i actually felt positive for once, i was excited to do things and was actually making plans for once, this was at work too! i could not believe how good i felt, and no i was not sti will high. i thought that maybe after all of these years i was finally back on track but i kept having a feeling in the back of my mind that i was going to fall again and of course it happened. woke up today feeling like shit and things only got worse from there, it is one thing to be depressed but to be given false hope only for it to be taken away feels like a punch in the gut. i am sick of dealing with this, i wish i could find the courage to end it.	moderate
need advice in life reposted dear reddit, i am a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering at a top uk university. i am writing this to ask for some advices related to my life in university. to be honest, i did not enjoy university at all besides the freshers week on my first year. after first year, the engineering curriculum started to get really tough especially subjects like thermodynamics in chemeng. because of this, i was spending everyday in uni studying by myself. which leads to the second issue. i am a loner in class. i believe it stems from my introverted lifestyle in which i like to play games and sleep all day during the weekend. i am unable to make deep connections with my classmates although i talk to them a lot. i have no problems socialising but i just seem to not find anyone interesting compatible to be friends with in school. third point, i am suffering with mad depression rn. my grandpa has gotten cancer, hes really old and is very far away from me atm hours flight one way . i really miss hi am so much but because of the really hard engineering classes, i can not really go back until at least june. this has made me feel really sad and i can not concentrate on my classes anymore. i have courseworks to be submitted by this week which counts for the grade and i just feel like bombing it tbh. please reddit, i would appreciate if you guys could give me a good advice that i can follow so that i can finish this damn degree and rest in peace 	moderate

life sucks hi, recently our family dog died jan , to this day i am sti will coping, heck i cried so much during the ash wednesday mass. i cried so hard for that dog, well it was the only ti ame i cried emotionally since i was a kid, and i wi will get back to why i started off with my dog dying. when i was like grade i realized my family was going to shit. grade when everything started to go down hi will. before it, it was mostly blocking off people that i thought wast just toxic people but i will never know because i went silent. friends is not that a word a lot of people cherish? not me my first emotional sadness and realization is that a person can easily be replaced through social status, i had trust issues because of my mom. at some point i just wanted to be better for people probably grade i just wanted to listen to people and fix their problems instead of fixing mine. to thistant myself from what i really feel, its hard for me to look for actual friend buts its easy for others to get attached to me since i have adjusted myself for other people more to the point that i am just frustrated since i can not seem to find the real me anymore at home when my family sees me my normal smile and nod, my siblings the silent one, my friends the funny loud outgoing nerd smart tough brave i have been called many things just to fit in with the people i am surrounded with. people would think my mom was the best caring mom, well i thought that to but when there is money involved she is the most ignorant this is the part where my mom gave me trust issues that everyone has another side money the root of all evil . the constant pressure from her that i should be better than everyone made me selfish and i hated it. the ti ames she ruined my passion for something because of the pressure she was putting on me, she made everything not fun of me. i sti will love her but damn i just wish she could see what i see. my father is the coolest, he is the smartest person i know in the flesh, but he does not know how his words affects me or my siblings, and hes the most unlucky one. his first wife he had to divorce because he caught her with someone else now he got stuck raising kids all boys then she found my mom which then made another batch of four kids boys girls me being the youngest hi am being yo he has a lot of knowledge in that head but someti ames forget words hurt, he to pressured to do things i did not want to do because i was to silent i could not say no because he just gets thisappointed and it just drags me down to that dark hole more when i feel that thisappointment so i just try but it just drains me. then recently without consideration of me being in the other room he was telling his sister about life and eventually came to the part where i was never planned. my siblings well i do not know why but they never had a god damn care for me well you could say tough love i do not know but shit i just wanted to talk someone so i go to their room and they i ammediately ask why are you here with the most irritating tone so i just respond with whatever like sorry i am looking for the scissors. then i just realized it was just me and my i amagination. grade after that i just went deeper and deeper in to that pit when i finally got to that part of wanting to end it all with the attempt i could not i just thought it was not the right ti ame, coming back to the dog, that dog was the only living soul i could put out who i was and what i felt, eventually i felt dumb cause i dint get an answer. i regretted so much after the dog died because i did not love hi am enough i was a bad owner. with all this emotions and no one to talk to i just thought i could share some of my bullshit life here in the internet. well yeah i share my shit to some select few but my problem with them is all of them dont know how to comfort well i am fine with it its just their comforting me the wrong way like saying do not worry you can always buy a new dog or yeah dont be to down i feel what you feel yeah i just can not stand it i would rather be left alone than hearing those things well if you read everything thanks for reading and sorry if i wasted your ti ame.	moderate
i am really sad and lost. i always seem to be the one to approach other people i am the one going out and talking to the introverts and trying to be friends, but it never feels like anyone cares for me. i always get overly sad when i mess up get something wrong or when someone feels negative towards me. when i am socializing i sadly depart because i mess up in small ways, but i do not think i am a horrible communicator. being sad is my default i am comfortable when i am sad. doesnt feel like its ever worth trying to be happy because it hits me harder each ti ame i sadden. i am and lost about what i want to do in life. i am lost about how much people actually enjoy my company want my company, but not many reach out. i never want to be annoying since that is how this all started when i was younger. i wanted attention and when i tried to get it i was always rejected. i am a very social person, but i can not decide whether or not that is an insecurity. the biggest thing is i feel like if i ghosted everyone nothing would change. seems like only my parents care about me. i am just unsure of how much i really know myself. what is real? what is the right way to feel about things? what should not be subjective? why can not i ever seem to feel the lord? have not i opened up my heart to hi am? am i socializing among others, or with others? i always felt rejected when i was younger. i sought a christian group because i thought i would feel included. why is it that i feel like i am such a small part of everything, even when i try not to be? maybe i expect things too quickly. maybe i get too attached. maybe i have a dependency on others for comfort. i think my extroversion is an insecurity, but i have had it my whole life. i have always told myself i just need to figure myself out, but i wind up worse than i had before thinking that, when i take ti ame to be alone. i need to stop hiding, yet i do not know what is true.	moderate
depression in li ambo i have battled with depression all my life. i have been foot off the stool, been i ammensely happy, been i ammensely sad. for the most part i have a good grip on my emotions though i have become insensitive to others going through the same thing. maybe as a way to block out that reality. i have rejoined society, got an okay job, good relationship with family and the people i work with, but i have never felt wanted, and i am terrified this is who i wi will be ti will the day i die, like everyone else grew up but i just got older. and the nights a week i work makes it difficult to find new work that allows for career opportunities. so i guess that is bumming me out so much that i have been thinking i would be better off dead, and no one outside my i ammediate family would miss me. i am not suicidal, could not take myself seriously doing it. how am i going to get out of this state of mind?	moderate
help? assistance? someti ames i do not understand my purpose for being here. i feel like the world could forget about me. i have not touched much of the world and my reach is small. i exclude myself from everyone but my girlfriend. right now i feel so alone. like i am sitting on a chair in an open yet empty universe. i sit here thinking what life would be like if i just tried a little more, put myself out there and set out on a mission to enjoy myself... but i can not do that, everyone could say i can and i can do what i want. however, i do not even know if that is what i want, i do not know what a like or what i want to do. i just do not want to be sitting here alone anymore. i do not want to feel so alone. i do not want to feel so trapped, tired, uncomfortable and off. i used to be happy, or at least i think i was, happiness to me now seems like a fleeting goal , always just outside my reach. i can crawl and fight to get a little taste but once i feel that happy grow inside me, i need more to feel like myself again. my happiness is not a habit, it is a fight for an addiction i crave. i want to be happy, happy all the ti ame laughing and smiling like so many others. like a childs i amagination. but that happy, that feeling i crave, that warmness i need, i can not help but sit here and feel empty. no sad, no happy. just nothing and no one, alone and empty. for an year old who planned on university for most of his school life because it seemed right and what everyone else was doing. i went to a private school and i had friends, i sti will have friends although i do not see them as much. i have more than most, my life has been reasonably comfortable and yet i feel like the world turned its back on me and i am trapped in a cycle of no knowing what comes next. i am oblivious to my own desires and wants, so i am left sitting here waiting, alone for a guide, a sign, something to tell me that it is going to be okay, that i wi will find someone to help. that a guide wi will show me a way. that success and happiness wi will reach out to me and finally i wi will accept. finally i wi will know what i want and where to go. how want to enjoy life now over this mundane nothing. i want to end this feeling, but i can not.	moderate

i do not know what to do anymore i can not take it anymore, the only coping tool i have is my friends, and i hate it. my family always says little things to me that, to a normal person would probably not affect, but after i am told to fuck off or that i am not enough, or that i am thisappointing them, i need hours to sit in my room and break down to myself, knowing that no one is there for me and that no one wi will ever want to help me, because what have i done for them? it is pretty much routine at this point, that i am forced to hold the tears back. i opened up to my mom, told her everything, and she broke down in front of me, now i am regretting telling her everything, she non stops worries about me, that is not what i wanted. and the fact that i struggle to find love, does not make it any better for me. i have been lonely since i was , i am as of now, i just can not fucking take this shit anymore. but i refuse to ki will myself for the sole reason of it being extremely selfish of me, and that i wi will affect everyone i know. i just, do not know what to do anymore, i just sit in my room for hours a day, and if i ever do get up to do anything, the tiniest shit can cause me to say fuck it and go back to my room to cry. and i always feel so guilty about everything. like i have everything that i could want, yet i sti will feel lonely constantly. i have people to talk to, but i always feel like i am going through this alone. someti ames i wonder if i am even allowed to be sad, i have no problems in my life, but i let my depression, anxiety, and loneliness take over. i know some people would not give a shit, but i need to tell someone, sorry.	moderate

iv got a question. could anyone out there be up for talking privately about going through a divorce? i am currently going through with my wife of three years and yes before you say anything. i know three years not that long, but guys we was in love. first girl i did anything with. slept together. showered together. smoked. watched movies. built legos. play video games together. loved together. swam together. if there was something we could do together. we did it. she was my best friend. she was. she was my best friend before we got married. and now she is gone. and i am trying to live with the fact she is gone. it is like something is messing from me. like someone died and i did not even know who they were. both of us are extremely torn by this. and no. i do not really want to go into detail. somethings can be spoken of. but i just want to talk about going through this alone?....this is extremely lonely. i try talking to people and i just feel like i do not belong. or i am just a bother now. i feel like no one really wants to hang out. or do much. i did everything with her for so long the little things remind me of what we had. see this on youtube oh she would love this. funny facebook video i should send this to her. like. it is so dumb. i am over it. but for some reason it would go away. i feel like i am going crazy you guys. i know i am not. but something is telling me i am. so if there is anyone out wi will you put up with me. please. send me a message. i would love the company. thank you.	moderate
feeling nothing is worse than feeling sad recently i finished my nd run of school after working for years to get a better job. as a straight a student i somehow had hope that life get better. i pulled through so much that i had hope again. now i can not find a job because i do not have experience in my new field, and while this is frustrating, i feel nothing. i quit my job that made me depressed so i could get better and now i am just drowning deeper. i feel no excitement for great things, for example, seeing my best friend after half a year. i feel no hunger and i only ate because he invited me to dinner, no enjoyment, our hugs feel empty and everything feels pointless. i truly love this person from the bottom of my heart but the feeling of, he is better off without me, becomes unbearable. it feels like it is just a matter of ti ame that i wi will feel the same about my relationship, the feeling of, this world is a better place without me..., and while i know that is not true now, i am afraid my mind wi will trick me into thinking otherwise in the future. i do not want to become a burden but it feels like i already lost that battle a long ti ame ago.	moderate

i am scared i am f and i feel like i have done nothing with my life. i am tired of my job and want to move on but there is not anything around outside retail and food. i can not support myself with my part ti ame job so i sti will live at home. i hate it cause i am constantly getting asked when i am going to get a full ti ame job or why do not i go out more. full ti ame jobs in my area that are related to my college degree do not exist. and going to do retail just gets me shit talked by my dad. i did retail for months before my current job and it was months of hi am shit talking me about getting a real job. going out to hang with friends is not much of an option either. i only have friend that stayed around by which i mean stayed in town after college and she is busy with her own life. i do not want to be that friend that clings to someone. i feel like of my friends have moved on with their lives. full ti ame jobs, buying houses, getting engaged. being happy. when some of them came back during the holidays i met with a group and it was nice, but i sti will felt so depressed. they all sound so happy with themselves. and i am just not. ever since meeting with them they are trying to invite me to their gatherings travel plans and i just can not afford it. and it just makes me feel small every ti ame i have to turn them down. i have always dealt with depression since back in middle school. my anxiety came in college, but now i feel so exhausted. i feel like i am not going anywhere. i graduated with a degree i wanted to change my junior year because i knew there would be no career path for me. my parents said just finish it and we ll think about what to do after you graduate. years later and my self hatred has grown. i feel no one arounds me understands my stress and low opinion i have of myself. i have tried talking about it with my parents and it is just you should not feel like that or it sounds like you re saying i am a bad parent. the conversation always turns and suddenly i am trying to console their parenting. i do not talk with my friends about these feelings. idk why i am writing this. maybe it is suppose to be therapeutic? idk. it is just i want to put this out there. cause today i had a scary thought. i am not happy. i do not remember the last ti ame i was and if this keeps going the way it is i do not think i wi will ever turn .	moderate
depression as a comfort is it possible that i am just numb to my own depression? i am not sure if i just blame my laziness and my self deprecating thoughts all on depression because i do not really know if i am depressed. depression seems to be like a scapegoat for me, but what if i am not truly depressed? i sti will feel as if i trigger my own depression. like depression is a warm blanket over me. if i try to go too far into the cold, i instantly run back to the warm blanket. i think i just tend to reason myself back into depression, not out of it... it seems like all of you are doing an amazing job trying to get out of it, while here i am, foolish enough to keep venturing back to where it was the worst. does depression make one mentally unstable too?	moderate

i have almost died a mere three ti ames in early childhood. father left when i was six. textbook drunk deadbeat. got my second chance at age when mother, brother and myself moved to the uk to live with mother is partner let us call her stepmother . due to the newfound support of middle class finances, my grades in school i amproved dramatically. unfortunately at the same ti ame, i was both bullied and sexually harassed apparently being a weak scrawny german nerd is not the best thing to be . th form was better, arguably the best ti ame of my life. problems were si ample what clothes to wear, what video games to play, and although i had no idea how girls operated, i sti will enjoyed spending ti ame with the handful of girlfriends i managed to keep interested for more than weeks. teenage years are very fickle let us be honest . throughout these ti ames i kept busy. hobbies were taken seriously and maintained with fervor and what little money i earned from my weekly paper round. i played basketball too so i was not a complete slacker. i had a couple of seizures as well, which were soon brought under control with anticonvulsants. some of you may be familiar with the mind calming effects of sodium valproate! coming now to an epileptic or bi polar person near you! all seemed right. then university hit. i chose psychology with counseling, as i wanted to provide to people the service that i now realized, i much needed. i did not have the grades needed for the uni in our town, so i chose a lesser option to one that was about a min drive away. i pulled through first year, but fell out the second. stress began to pile up and i was barely able to look after myself. personal standards began to slip with regards to food and hygiene. although i had money, friends and a roof over my head, there was no motivation to speak of. the anxiety of lonesome living ground this to dust. i was clearly not prepared for this next step in life i thought, so back home i went. i spent the next six months unemployed as a freeloader at my parents house. this was the first ti ame i ever felt suicidal. between the anger and frustration at my own failure and the pressure placed on me by anything and everything i could name, was a sense of shame so deep it warped my self confidence and my identity. i started keeping a diary, and with each entry i could see the emotions burning over and the motivation burning out. it got to the point where i felt no longer human, that i was but a tool to be used and thiscarded a tool that soon realized that it had no use. a tool with no use is a pointless concept, and so i started depriving myself of basic human needs, in a feebleminded attempt to atone for my meaningless existence. no food. no water. no friends. nothing except grief and anger. yes that is right, anger. a burning fury toward the world so hot it probably burned through most of my synapses. i started blaming everything i could to alleviate the pain i felt. injustice in the world. society. everything. i eventually landed a job at a call center. processing payments and chasing account details over the phone for a big telecomms company. finally, my luck turns! i thought. it was a dead end job with mini amum wage, but it was a start. and i started to hope once again. maybe, if i tried hard enough, i could prove i was not useless. maybe then i could get somewhere. and for the next two years i worked my butt off. i excelled at my role, did overti ame when asked and volunteered when not. i made friends with everyone, and everything seemed right as rain. and then it happened my first panic attack at the age of , around the same ti ame a good friend of mine died very suddenly from sudden adult death syndrome at the age of . one day he was there, the next day he was dead. the palpitations during the panic attack were new and understandably unbearable. i thought i was having a heart attack and that i was going to die. an ambulance was called. i calmed down after about hours. everything went back to normal. or so i thought. the attacks became regular, and eventually got bad enough for me to take two weeks off for stress something never done before. during this ti ame, all the colleagues i made friends with were starting to leave one by one, for various reasons. maybe it was my ti ame too? and so i left the company in search for greener pastures. i picked up another call center gig, this ti ame with an existing friend. again it was outbound calls, so i was sort of cold calling just like before. the same procedure followed, i made friends and gave it effort. i eventually got promoted once to an advisory role and once again to an it position due to some ski wills i picked up while i was unemployed free online courses and stuff . once again i thought what a lucky break! i was earning a comfortable living, and was able to support my family through some tough ti ames. alas, all good things must end. and so, just like before, the friends i had made at the company started leaving one by one. but i stuck with where i was, as i could see a future in my current position. the anxiety and depression were sti will at large yes, but manageable with only the occasional sick day or early finish. fast forward to around may june last year. boom. stepmother diagnosed with motor neurons thisease think stephen hawking . only this type was a lot more aggressive. what started as slurred words soon deteriorated into much more. as my stepmother slowly lost control of her faculties, my family and i had to care for her around the clock. eating, going to the bathroom, hygiene. everything. if i had to describe it, it was as if caring for an infant, only instead of watching the beautiful potential of life as it develops, you get to watch a loved one die more and more each day, and they do not even have the blessing to be unconscious for half of it. during this ti ame, my work performance tanked hard. understandably so. i explained my situation to my employer, and it was decided to place me on part ti ame work. but my mental state si amply continued to deteriorate. what used to be weekly panic attacks turned to daily anxiety, and every shift at work was torture. i could not uphold my end of the contract i signed, so, after a long and unsuccessful return to work program, i was demoted in december. the idea was less stress, but work is always stressful for me. i either take it seriously, or not at all there is no middle ground for me. i am either useful, or useless. shortly after, my bed bound stepmother developed a clot in her lungs, and two weeks later she died. it was the first ti ame i ever saw a dead body, let alone that of a loved family member. i cried no tears in front of the family, instead retreating to my bedroom to cry and howl in private. it is now been a month since her death, and my family is shattered. all are numb to my attempts at communicating, and it seems everyone has moved on except me. i feel...alone and cold. not a day goes by where i do not feel a vile concoction of shame, regret, bitterness and sorrow. even my friends are unable to talk to me about the afflictions that plague my mind. my work is hanging by a thread, and every oath i try to make on my path to recovery, only seems to poison the future i am so desperately trying to save. i am not a religious man, and i am a half backed atheist at best. the only truth i believe in, is that obliteration of consciousness leads to eternal nothingness. there are no consequences of life in a personal sense. life has no meaning, so why bother? i have tried flipping the perspective and thinking well why not bother? but that is just rhetoric for passivity and stagnation. i have also tried to i amagine the future as an eternal beacon of unpredictable hope, but i do not have the patience for such drivel. why place trust in something that can not be predicted? i would sooner bank on the cosmic chances of the universe exploding, creating itself again, and all the particles of space dust to slowly align over mi willions of years in a si amilar enough way to allow my consciousness to exist once more, if at all. i have tried everything. lifestyle changes. therapy. seeking a partner. heck, i have been on antidepressants for whole years. nothing is getting better, only worse. i fantasize about death every day. how i would die. where and when. if i got the chance to say goodbye to the people i love. all i have left is fear and death. but here is the kicker fear is both making me feel suicidal, and preventing me from doing so at the same ti ame. after all, who can think about suicide, when they are having a panic attack? and so i am trapped. trapped in an existence in a world i hate with a passion. stuck, because the fear the drives me insane is also the very fear that is keeping me alive just being another statistic. tl dr i want to die fam but my body would not let me. p.s. do not worry guys, i am an organ donor so if i do ki will myself, i wi will do it so that my organs stay in decent enough condition.	moderate
i do not know how to go forward all started when i was and it was parents evening at school and my mom went. the teacher told my mom that it was like a light had gone out inside me, and that i was not the person i used to be and she told my mom that she should keep an eye on me. my mom started to notice it and that is when i realised that i was struggling and that life should not feel like this. i am now and sti will struggling with anxiety and depression. i have not left the house in about years. i met a guy years ago and it was an extremely toxic relationship and i put a lot of weight on, we broke up a year ago. i was not happy with my body years ago but it was not stopping me leaving the house. now i can not look in the mirror i avoid everything that might show a reflection of myself, and now i feel like there is no moving forward, i am extremely suicidal and my mom knows this, she tries to help me but there is only so much she can do, i sleep all day and stay awake all night amp i feel isolated and empty. i am really struggling and need tips or advice to at least help me get a little bit better	moderate

sex drive does anyone else is sex drive go through the roof when they are in a depressive episode? the thing that really triggered this relapse was my emotionally and verbally abusive, live in boyfriend breaking my car on valentine is day. the cops were called, i was terrified and devastated. he fixed my car by the next afternoon so i am letting hi am sleep on the couch until he find a new place. he also knows hes one more outburst away from a restraining order. he is been in prince charming mode and even scheduled a counseling appointment because he knows he needs to change and does not want to lose me, but i am sti will bed ridden, uninterested in everything, and tired. the irony is that the only thing that makes me feel human anymore is by having sex with the guy that made me feel inhuman in the first place. and i do not have the energy or confidence also his doing as i would look better if i lost weight to find anyone else to meet that need.	moderate
recently came out of a hour psych hold long story short, i got drunk a few weeks back, said i wanted to harm myself on facebook after an angry rant where i misinterpreted being blamed for my cousin is suicide a few years ago by his family. his family really did not like hi am and think he was a great father and i got a little defensive about those remarks. i know, complicated family pain mixed with alcohol nothing good the truth was that i was not actually going to harm myself and because i was drunk, i actually managed to forget i posted a reply about self harm until my dad showed up and asked me if i was okay. then i thought to myself, shit, did i say i was going to harm myself? damn... damn... damn i told hi am that i felt like i was being attacked by family on facebook and trying to defend myself. he told me that a family member had contacted hi am and asked hi am to check up on me. as i sat there crying about my cousin is suicide that was what i was really getting riled up about then i hear a long banging on the door, police... i thought to myself, well i really done it now, i am in trouble with the police... damn. my dad lets them in and they ask me a few questions, i do not remember exactly what they asked me because i was sti will drunk and pretty embarrassed that officers were at my place asking me if i was okay over stuff i wrote on facebook. they did told me to walk outside with them and sit on the steps, my hands were cuffed together with some plastic ties and they told me i was not under arrest but that i was going to be put on a hour psych hold. i told them that i knew what that was since i had a psych degree and complied with the order, knowing i was too drunk and upset to make a go at trying to contest it. i eventually end up getting a bed in the psych ward later on that day i got taken in at like am and it took several hours to get a bed a psychiatrist stops by for minutes to make a quick evaluation on me. this is the first ti ame i am seeing a psychiatrist so i am actually excited to talk to them and explain to them what is going on and if i can get a diagnosis for possible depression and anxiety. she looks at me and starts behaving like a salesperson selling snake oil to me there is such an easy road you can go on and you ll feel so much better, you wouldn t believe it! and that is taking anti depressants! i told her that i did not mean any offense to her but i have done extensive research on ssri is and i wanted to know if i could get a diagnosis by the doctor but pursue cbt, one on one therapy, group therapy, meditation mindfulness which i had done during graduate school , dietary changes, minute daily exercises, and just small things like that to help with my depression and anxiety. she looked at me, and said something really awkward to me.... you sound like a smart girl. but why do all of that stuff, when all you need to do is take a pi will? i can put you on a trial...... it is your decision on whether you want to take the easy road or the harder bumpier road... that was when i really did not want to continue our conversation further, i realized that the only way she was going to help me is if i agreed to her anti depressant route instead of exploring other options. i told her very politely, i am sorry to waste your ti ame doctor, but i have to decline on the medication route... she then just stared at me for a good seconds it felt like one of those stares that seemed like minutes and she said with a very neutral expression okay then, you ll be released after hours... just like that, she left, and i never saw her again. i was released after hours, i met a bunch of very kind and gentle souls in that psych ward that had very different stories to tell and different degrees of mental i willness. i was given very little information about followups after my release and on my release record, it stated that i refused treatment and refused to listen to the doctor. it made it seem like i did not want to get help or get a diagnosis, so the statement on the document made me frustrated. i signed it anyways, because i could not stand being caged and locked up for another second and i did not want to risk getting an extended ti ame due to frustrating the doctor. it is been a few weeks since i have been out of there. i am sti will actually recovering from the experience since i sti will feel like a bad person and my dad now calls me everyday and asks me if i am doing okay code word for, you re not going to harm yourself honey right? and it makes me feel like crap knowing he thinks i am mentally fragile or on edge. i do not use alcohol anymore and i plan on finding out a way to get one on one therapy or find a support group for depression and anxiety locally in my county. anyway, my question is si amply this, is it possible to find a psychiatrist to talk to without them giving a sales pitch on the latest successful ssri medication that they think wi will work wonders for me, or are they going to behave like that doctor at the psych ward did and not want to diagnosis or anything to do with me if i say no to the medications? am i better off just not getting a diagnosis and working with psychologists and therapists that do not really bother me with those things?	moderate

i dont know how to deal with this!!!! hi i am a year old male who has never really struggled with depression before these last couple years. my dad decided to end his own life years ago and nothing has been the same for me since then. my dad was my hero he was addicted to drugs my whole childhood but then he beat addiction and was drug free he even started his own successful business. but then year before he committed suicide he relapsed and just like that he was gone and even two years later i sti will can not figure out how to deal with this. i have even had thoughts of committing suicide myself. it is so hard because he was very well know around town and some dont know he committed suicide so when they ask about hi am i have taken to making up fake scenarios for how he passed. i just can not get passed this depression right now and i dont know how to deal with it since i have never felt with it before i am just so lost,tired,drained and sick of everything at this point .what do i do!!!!!	moderate

i do not think my depression is severe enough to be diagnosable since middle school i have felt depressed not until freshman year when i was caught self harming i had to start going to therapy. i have seen this therapist for roughly three years at this point, and she is wanted to try and move forward with the possibility to starting to process of diagnosis three ti ames. most recently last week she gave me the ulti amatum since my depression is at its worst. i have lost pounds to in the span four months. for a long ti ame i was na ve thinking that i already hit rock bottom. but i was very wrong. throughout sophomore year i smoked pot excessively, and i could not keep up with family or friends let alone basic necessities such as properly care for myself or my room. doing anything, even as si ample as brushing my teeth or organising shoes was too much for me to handle. now as a junior though i have stopped smoking, i am once again unable to do anything. i can not do anything i enjoy, let alone tasks that i feel are taxing. i have not felt more suicidal in a long ti ame, every morning i hate being alive, i am angry i am alive. i hate the fact that i have to live. it does not feel like i am living. my head is detached, it always has been but now that feeling of thisconnection is even more. most days i do not feel like i am even alive, i am just here. i can respond to people around me but i hate it. i hate talking to people in my life cause they try to force me to be happy when all i want is to be alone. i can never find peace. nothing about life is enjoyable, everything is dull. it seems like this fog around me wi will not seize. i wish i could tie my head to my body but i am never been tall enough to grasp it. sorry for the rant if you read this, it means a lot to me.	moderate
this life is over. waking up every morning is like greeting another day in hell. i look at old pictures and videos of a person i do not even recognize anymore. what do you do when you have exhausted every resource in the book? pi wills, doctors, psychiatrist, psychologist, meditation, exercise... none of those help. it wi will get better just hang on for what? to keep being miserable every second of the day? i see no meaning in this life anymore. the world and life keeps going while i am stuck in this rotting state of mind. nothing else left to live for. if i had a gun i wouldn t even think about weather to shoot myself or not. i used to look at suicide as a thing that nobody should go through, but now i completely understand why they go through it. do not know which day might be my last, but it might be soon. so over this life i did not want.	moderate

it hurts and i do not know how to stop the pain whenever i think about my future it feels like a weight is pressing down on my chest and i have a sharp pain in my stomach. i have never felt so alone before, and if i am being completely honest the only reason i keep trying to continue on is for my family. at the same ti ame i feel like a burden to them, that if i was gone they would be better off in the long run. i feel i have no one to turn to. i have had full blown panic attacks, where i was on the ground curled up on the floor. i felt like i could not breathe and my vision went spotty, and i was told i was just doing it to myself. that its all in my head. i just do not know how much longer i can pull through and it terrifies me.	moderate

i think i have lost the ability to care! recently after coming out of treatment for drugs weed anyways i relapsed a days ago, just had the few smokes, done and dusted and have full intentions of not going near it again. anyways i did not really feel anything after relapsing and sti will do not, i just do not care! it is what it is. from going into treatment and the several weeks prior to that i have been feeling emotionally numb. during treatment i really started to notice it and began thinking of stuff to make myself cry, weird right? i have normally been quite a sensitive gal. since hitting my twenties and maybe a lil before that.. in july i have really became numb. i feel i have no attachment to anything and that nothing can suprise me anymore. definitely have taken a backseat on life. my peers find it so strange that i can sit in my room alone days at a ti ame, with not a bother in the world. in the situations where i must socialise i seem to be observing more, which i enjoy you learn a lot more. i used to be quite outgoing look long story short, i just do not care. i am just here for the ride, the experience! there is neither good or bad, just growth, in my opinion. i am wondering is my inability to feel emotions the past while something to do with depression or is this just a normal part of growing up? like physically i have no energy. mentally awake. emotionally numb.	moderate

just another virus crisis victi am. spiraling downward as depression symptoms return due to school closing induced unemployment... i was writing suicide notes a couple years ago because my life had truly come to a dead end, in addition to my usual mental health issues. i moved to se asia to teach english and turned my life around. this is my home. i have so many friends, and up until now, a great job market. i quit my old job when my contract expired just before tet chinese new year , counting on jumping into public schools which is extremely easy. do that for some cash while looking for another real language center job. i am on stalled job offer at one center. that is right. offered two jobs already that thisappeared due to school closings. this is after being strung along for months by an international school. now, i am waiting for the results of another interview. as usual it is well past the promised ti ame i was told i would hear back by. i was already not doing well mentally due to a couple months of employment uncertainty before vacation. now i am going to go for months total without a paycheck. i am nearly out of money, back to relying on my parents again. i am extremely angry at the world, depressed, not eating much, etc. i have not felt this bad in a couple years. the symptoms are familiar at least. they are pretty shitty but temporary. this virus bs wi will end. the worst part is trying to mini amize damage to my precious new friendships while i spiral downward. forcing myself to agree to plans and pretending i am okay. it is exhausting and i hate revealing this side of myself, i am ashamed.	moderate

 i am fine this is the most common lie i ever make. i make it many ti ames a week, if not everyday of some weeks. i am truly broken apart inside, but the most i can bring myself to say is i am fine. i always try to crack a weak smile to people do not ask what is wrong. my life is a long story and i am worried they would not care what i have to say. what i am fine truly means to me is that i am afraid to tell how i feel. i am worried about being judged, i am afraid they si amply would not care, i am afraid they wi will think i am weak, and i am afraid somebody wi will just say that i am feeling down or have the blues or that they have been sad too. depression is none of those. depression is that feeling, among many others being carried with you every moment of every day. my depression is even accompanied by horrible anxiety and adhd, making things even worse for me to handle. and furthermore, if i did tell somebody how i truly felt, i am worried i would ruin their day with my sad emotions, or that they would just get sick of listening and zone out. my own friends do not want to hear about my emotions, which makes me hold it in and keep it to myself one of the most unhealthy things possible. but, when nobody else cares about you, you re best off being quiet and solitary.	moderate

final draft hi everyone to be honest with you i do not know where to start or even where to end. i have always wanted to write down my thoughts at night since i first was going through what i am going through now, but never got around to it. decided reddit would be the best place for my voice to be heard without my voice being heard. i just want to start off with saying that i have spent the past year trying to make things better but the old me is never coming back. i lost interest in everything and it does not seem like my life is going anywhere. i wish i could find something i am good at or a path for me to embark on, but i do not want to live like this anymore. i understand my parents are trying to help me, but it seems like things are not getting better. ever since i was little i have always been the quiet one. so quiet, as a matter of fact, that people think i am weird . i get shy easily in public and can not hold a normal conversation outside of my family members. the friends i once had all moved on with their lives and i am stuck in the past. talking to them feels just as awkward now as it feels for me to talk to a stranger. i wish i could do well in school again. my whole life, all i had going for me was my academic ability. some would say it was a gift i was born with, others could say it was my hard work that deserved it. i always performed at the highest levels in school. i have none of that now, as i struggle to attend classes and turn in assignments. i once had perfect attendance and that has turned into the near opposite. i just do not have any drive or motivation anymore. nothing to look forward to. i decided that tomorrow wi will be my last day. maybe some wi will say do not worry things wi will get better . but i do not care. you can call me selfish, it does not matter. at the end of the day, i realized that life is not for me. wi will i have regrets? yes. i never attended prom, never talked to any girls, never traveled to my parents home country, never got my first job, never drove a car, never got a chance to buy a house or apartment, never got a chance to buy my dream car. it does not matter though. all of my dreams wi will stay that way dreams. yes i wi will feel bad for those i leave behind. but at the same ti ame, perhaps leaving them behind is the only way they wi will notice me. i wi will never be the president, i wi will never be in movies, never catch a pass from tom brady. but the one thing i wi will always be is myself. maybe i am not perfect, but i am me. i wi will live as me and i wi will die as me. so i decided tomorrow is it. at first i wanted to stay up late and not go to sleep to enjoy my last moments. but now i realized that what i would enjoy most right now is a quiet night of sleep. i do not want to cry to bed anymore. i do not want to think those thoughts anymore. i am sorry if i ruined anyone is mood or ti ame wasted reading this. maybe one day we wi will meet again. before i go, i just want to say the thing that would really help right now is if i could just give my mom and dad one last hug.	moderate
an endless cycle i am constantly stuck in an endless cycle. i feel so deeply and painfully. everything hurts. i keep putting myself out there and it always fails. i just cry and feel so raw. when i can not take that anymore i become numb and close myself off from anyone. i walk around like i am in a dream. i sleep until pm. i stop texting friends or calling my parents. i just can not deal with the pain so i just become numb. and then when i feel like i am missing out on life and venture out of the numbness, i get hurt and the cycle starts back over again. i am so done with it all.	moderate

so i am travelling to a coronavirus affected country soon. i hope i get it most people are scared of contracting the coronavirus. i however would be glad to get it. i would get to die without hurting my family with the stigma of suicide. everyone dies anyway. is not it crazy that if someone dies from an i willness, people automatically roll out sympathy but with suicide, many people wi will condemn, criticize and blame the victi am. leaving many families unable to process their grief and leaving them feeling alone and isolated in their grief. i dont want that for my family. i feel like dying from an i willness is a win win situation. i get to die without having to commit suicide. its not ideal, of course. but nothing in life is ever ideal. anyone able to relate?	moderate

why am i like this. i push away the people who love me and who i deeply care about, like i think it wi will somehow protect them...and i do it knowing fully it wi will just feel like a knife to the heart i cry out for help, yet i am always too scared and paranoid to take it. no matter how much people tell me i sti will fear they are listening to my problems out of pity, or to use my vulnerability against me i feel so alone and abandoned by people, yet i can not even make the effort to connect with friends and family, to take the ti ame to talk to them, hang out with them, do things with them i have so many opportunities and so much potential, yet i am too unmotivated, meek, and apathetic to put in the work i have hobbies and things i do that make me happy, but i no longer have the attention span to do those things i enjoy. my energy to engage in my hobbies is completely gone i say i wi will try my very best to get better, but inside i know i am lying, and i know there is no hope or help for me. its all just a waste of ti ame and effort, trying to help a lost cause like me.	moderate
i just want to be happy. my depression has been so much worse since the death of my best friend. he was taken from me last sunday, and every night i find myself crying in bed over what has happened. before this i was finally starting to learn how to be happy again. i was slowly coming to terms with the violent death of my mother, becoming more open with my friends, and learning to not hate myself as much. now though i just feel like a lot of my progress has been ripped from me, and i guess people can argue that i let my progress be stunted but i can not help how i feel about this entire mess. not only have i started having suicidal thoughts again, but i have found myself just really down, having zero energy, constantly crying, and just not wanting to be around people. i feel really closed off, and i do not know what to do because the coping mechanisms that were working are not working as much. mostly because i can not comprehend why the world has to shoot me when i finally heal from the last bullet it shot into me. i do not understand why i can not just be happy for once, and why something terrible has to happen after only a few months of happiness. i know people argue that happiness wi will never be permanent, and i am fully aware of that. if you do not feel sadness then are you even truly living your life? but all my life i have been so depressed, angry with myself, and have hated myself. i finally start to not feel these things as much, and then something like this happens. i never expected not to feel sadness, but i guess i did not expect something i care about and love with all my heart dying so soon after my mom did. the world could have done anything to make me feel bad. not give me the internship i was gunning for, cause a rift between me and a friend, car accident... truly anything, and i would have been able to cope my way out of it, but another death? it is so hard to cope with that because death is something that makes something permanently gone. you can never get that thing back. you can never have memories with them again. death is so very permanent. a fight with a friend can be resolved, or you can move on knowing you re both making the best of life and that you have spoken your peace. a new internship can come along, one that might be even better then the one you were gunning for. you can heal from a car accident, and even if you do not fully heal you can at least learn to live a semi happy life with the damage. death though? there is no options there. you can never bring that thing back. you can never resolve that issue. you can never fully move on from it. it is always there in the back of your mind, watching you, reminding you that it can take something from you at any point and that everything you care about wi will one day be owned about it. you see, i have lost pets to death and coped okay for the most part, mostly because almost all my pets have died from old age. they lived a full, happy life. i never really comprehended death until i lost someone who was a major part of my life, and now i suppose you can argue i am over sensitive to it now. i am worried for death taking every person at some point. i i amagine how i would feel if certain people die, and i make myself depressed i amagining how lonely life would be without them. most of the people in my life are going as well with plenty of life to live, but that matters little because now i understand that there is a chance for anyone dying at any point. every ti ame someone drives a car, every ti ame some walks across the street, every ti ame someone gets sick, hell, really any ti ame someone wakes up in the morning is a chance of them dying. so every night i cry. i mostly cry over those i have lost, especially my sweet baby boy who passed away on sunday, but i also cry at the prospect of who wi will die next. who wi will be taken from me next? when wi will they be taken? wi will it be in a few years? in a few months? tomorrow? someti ames i feel bad because nobody wants to hang around someone who is constantly scared of the world and constantly down. so someti ames i wish it would just be me who dies next, so nobody has to put up with me anymore, and so everyone i love can live a stress free life. people deserve so much better then what i give them, and i am nothing more then a burden in their life. so if i could take their spot in the list i would, because they deserve to live more then i do. i have always said i would die for someone, even most of my ani amals, and people always chuckle like i am joking but honestly i am not. i realize how depressed death makes someone, so if i can prevent others from feeling that pain i would gladly offer up my insignifican not life that people would not grieve over as much. i just wish i could be happy. for once in my life.	moderate
going through the motions. i do not think i am unique in this feeling. honestly, i do not think i am unique in anything, but that is neither here nor their. i do not understand how people keep doing this. all of this. waking up, going to work, over and over and over again. i spend me whole week hating my job, and then spend anyti ame out of work in bed. i have ti ame. if i had a hobby, i would have ti ame. but i do not have a hobby. i just... exist. whenever someone asks me what i want to do, i can not answer it. there is really nothing i want to do. no craft i care about, no life long goal, no passion. i do not want a family, or even a spouse or boyfriend. i do not have a favorite genre of, well, anything. when people ask, i tell them what i think wi will make me look good. i like video games, but rarely play them. i like horror movies but i do not watch anything. i like , etc. etc. i can not even answer the question about my favorite color or food. what good do people like these days? okay, i like that. even my username. it seems cute, so i wi will pick that. i do not like anything in it, but it sounds cute to someone. it is got nothing to do with me. i am just tired. i am tired of all of this because there is no point for me. i have been in bed all day, and wi will be in bed all day tomorrow. i wi will be wishing i was in bed when i go back to work, and then go home to stay in bed again. rinse and repeat. i know i made this to vent, so i am sorry if this is the wrong place.	moderate

 i am not depressed i know this is weird, that this post wi will probably be lost, and that i do not deserve to post here anyways. but i am confused. i know i wi will regret this later. i wi will regret posting it. my parents signed a form saying that they did not want the counselor anywhere near me so i would not be seeing her anymore. they do not believe in my having depression because they can not see me depressed. i have a happy life, and apparently i am just seeking attention. it is just a phase and the doctor was just lying. but something i have been doing is just telling myself. whenever my mood sinks deeper and those horrible angry thoughts show up, i just think i am not depressed. and i ignore it and ignore it until its this screaming ball in my head and then i have a breakdown. it is like part of me does not believe i am depressed and constantly tries to reassure myself i am not depressed even though i have been diagnosed , and my other part is just wanting to cut and scratch myself until it bleeds and die. it is so scary. i know others here have it much worse, and they should be given validation and help and support. i know i am just overreacting. i have told myself it enough ti ames. but it is terrifying. telling myself i am not, i am not, i am not, until everything caves and cracks and then telling myself i am not again and again and it is terrifying what is wrong with me? why can not i just suck it up? why can not i be normal. i am not depressed. i am not depressed. i can not be depressed. it is just a phase. i am just overreacting. i am a piece of shi that overreacts. i am just faking it. i am justfakingit. i should just ki will myself. but it is ok. i am not depressed i am not depressed i am not depressed. i just want it to stop. i am probably not depressed just faking and overreacting and crying over nothing like a typical teenager who just wants attention and i should just stop. it is a phase. i am just so tired.	moderate

has anyone had amitriptyline dreams and predicted the future? okay the title sounds weird but hear me out. trigger warning trauma mention i was on the drug amitriptyline and i had the weirdest dreams. they were very vivid and so...weird. years later recently , i have had deja vu from those dreams. i predicted a lot of stuff and it is kinda been freaking me out. i wrote down some of the dreams and i need to find the notes. but i swear to everything holy, i predicted stuff in my life. like situations and even trauma. i know who the strangers in my dreams are now. my nightmares were predicting my recent trauma stuff and i am scared to tell anyone because i do not want to sound crazy. i was taking amitriptyline then and the dreams stopped after my doctor said to not take it anymore. and i am pretty sure that weird vivid dreams and nightmares are a side effect. btw i do not remember have dreams. but has this happened to anyone else??? please answer because i want to make sure i am not losing it. thank you 	moderate

what is the point in extending your life if you hate every second of it? i used to be against weed because it causes brain damage, cause it can lead on to worse drugs. i used to only drink alcohol as a social thing. but then i realised what is the point in being against it. i hate nearly every second of my life. the most enjoyable thing in life is sleeping. why should i care if i am slowly ki willing my brain cells. so i smoked. now i smoke weed every couple days. also i drink alone. and you know what. there is nothing anybody can say to get me out of it. i am suicidal anyway so there is literally no downside to this.	moderate

i broke my leg and i am happy i did ive been depressed my whole life, ever since i can remember. probably around second grade if i had to guess is when it started. my parents got divorced when i was and i went back and forth every day. my mom would take me to school and my dad would pick me up. at the end of the night i would go back to my mom s. i would see my mom less and less as i grew up until i was like . she married another guy and had kids. my dad was always working, he is a ups driver. i can not remember a ti ame of hi am telling me i love you. but i know he does, he shows it other ways. never affectionate. he is very overprotective too. if i did get invited to some kids birthday party he wouldn t let me go. i could not go outside for a walk until i was like already . i did not really have any friends in school until probably freshman year of high school. i got bullied alot in school during and after third grade. the third day of third grade my stomach was twisting. it was horrible pain. i went home and it went away. every day after for a couple months the same thing happened. i think i was having anxiety attacks now that i type it out lol but i do not think anyone ever told me what was going on. i was given some medicine and it helped alot, eventually i stopped taking it probably a month after. nobody liked me since then, who wants to be friends with the fat kid who cries everyday infront of everyone. i think this was the spark to my depression. ever since then i did not really care about school. i stopped doing homework probably some ti ame around th grade and completely probably stopped around th grade. i had zero motivation to do it. just copied off my friends. my test scores were decent, it was not like i am a moron it is just i did not care enough to go to school. i ended up dropping out senior year. this whole ti ame i am playing video games by the way. ever since i was with my gamecube to when i was with my psp to when i was with my ps to when i was with my ps to my pc that i sti will play. my escape from my life. all day everyday, i had a problem. i would stop going to school to play video games. i had severe depression probably around junior year. stopped brushing my teeth everyday maybe once in a while. stopped showering every day as embarrassing as that sounds. i wouldn t let it get to a point where i could smell myself but i stopped showering everyday. my hygiene went to fuck, my bedroom was always a mess, i had zero motivation to clean it. i probably weighed around , my max. i started working on my life a little. i started going for walks i got a job some how at kohl s. worked there for a year. during that i would walk for miles. i would walk home from work which was about miles. i would go for an evening walk for a few hours everyday. i went from an xl being a little snug to a medium being a little big. over this ti ame period. dropped to my lowest ever, . i am sti will depressed during this whole ti ame but i am forcing myself to actually do something, which was working or walking. i put in my two weeks because i was fed up with the drama and the verbal harassment after a year of working there. on the same day i turned in my two weeks, this girl i worked with asked for my number. let us call her alex. i was kind of confused because i remember her mentioning her husband a couple ti ames. i was so dumb with girls. one girl junior year gave me her snapchat, number and instagram and never texted me ever. it was so obvious she liked me, her friends were going up to me and telling me she likes me. i never made a move because i had zero self worth. how could a cute girl like that want me? is what i told myself. another girl would tell me after she moved schools and came back junior year that i was the only person she remembered and gave me her number. i think she kinda told me she liked me but i am going on. i never ended up having a girlfriend in high school. i end up texting the girl that gave me her number, alex. she is i am at this point and divorced as in moved out as of a month of her asking for my number as i find out on our first date. gosh all the red flags are there looking back. anyways our first date was sparks. we end up making out for a few hours. in the back of her van. we almost end up doing something but she was on her period. she had issues i had issues. she was depressed too. we were both not ready to be in a relationship but we were. we both found the same thing in each other, happiness. an escape? i am not sure but man we spent a whole lotta ti ame together. we would spend every moment we could either on the phone or with eachother. the sex was amazing. we would fuck everyti ame we saw eachother. either it would happen in a dressing room, bathroom, public, the car, her house, anywhere. we were going to have it somewhere. i am sti will depressed at this point but it is nice to have someone to have fun with. i am sti will not cleaning my room. i would only shower if i smelled or if i saw her the next day. i end up breaking up with her because i knew things weren t right after one year of us dating. things were not going to last. multiple insecurity issues on both sides, both depressed, a couple more things. she fucked a guy two days after. i found out after i went to her house two days after to ask her to come back to me and tell her i made a mistake not a mistake after all . that devastated me emotionally, mentally, physically. i was just on autopilot. two weeks after this girl that i would spend my breaks with started really flirting with me hard. this girl is a goddess. cute face , nicest butt i have ever seen in person, nice body in general. i was shocked because i always saw her talking to guys, guys walking her to her car, stuff like that. btw we work at ups and it is male to female ratio. i am an idiot, i am not ready for a relationship at all. i am sti will depressed, sti will talking to my ex. me and my ex were hooking up while i was talking to her. this girl was not good for me at all. her ex texts her on our first date and she groans. i go what is up and she says her ex is texting her. she was instantly texting back. i think she thought i was stupid or something. she would post on her instagram story of her shaking her ass with a guy recording. but we re not together and i am doing what shes doing so. anyways i took her ice skating day before christmas eve. i broke my leg. i am not at rock bottom yet. i am letting this girl play with my emotions, she is posting on her story of her hanging out at a guys house almost every other day. we were talking things slow due to her. it took dates for a kiss. i end up calling her out because i showed her this spot where you can see city lights and she post on her story with a guy there! things end here after like months of talking to each other. i hit rock bottom. i have a broken leg, my teeth are fucked, my room is actually terrible, soda cans everywhere. i want to do something about them but i can not since my leg. my broken leg was a blessing in thisguise. i had ti ame to think by myself. i got a wax pen or whatever it is called and started smoking because what else am i suppose to do. i got my cast off weeks ago. ti ame and weed helped me have some major realizations. i have realized that i have been depressed my whole life and did not know it. the morning after i had that realization, i walked to the bathroom with no struggle, no thought of my leg hurting. just a pee first thing in the morning. that was such a huge accomplishment i started crying in the bathroom after i realized what i did. that same morning i felt like i had the power physically to clean my room and i did. it took two days but i did it. i bought a new bed, new nightstand, took care of the pile of clothes on bed that i neglected to fold or hang every week i wash them. i scheduled a dentist appointment for tuesday. i started going to pt again yesterday. went to the gym today, cleaned my car. blocked both of those girls from everything since they sti will try to hit me up. i bought an electric toothbrush and i am not hiding my smile anymore i feel like i have been given a second chance at life since i have gotten my cast taken off. i sti will feel the depression there and there could have been a few things trying to drag me down but i am fighting, i am fighting hard, i am not depressed anymore for the first ti ame in my life. i am crying as i type this.i am scared i am going to lose again and go back to how i was since i feel like it is so easy to but i do not want to thank you for reading this if anyone does.	moderate

no appetite so i have noticed that my depression has been pretty severe these past few months. it is even a struggle to even feed myself. like i am hungry i know i should eat, but i feel so tired and numb and like a weight is weighing me down. so i feel like it is a chore to feed myself. i hate this because i lose weight so easily and i need to eat but it is so hard for me. is this a symptom of anxiety? is this relatable to anyone? please if you have any advice to give i would greatly appreciate it. thank you.	moderate
i do not know what i am supposed to want or what i am supposed to be doing but i fucking hate living all i want is a girlfriend. i was with someone for a year, and it was the only ti ame in my adult life that i felt like an actual person who was worth something. we broke up a year ago. in the ti ame since i have grown up a lot. got a good job that pays well, moved out of my parents house, moved into a really nice apartment in the city, where i wanted to live for a while. i lift weights for hours at a ti ame every other day, i eat healthy, only drink socially, never use any drugs. i am doing all the things that i was told i am supposed to do and somehow i do not feel like i am any closer to happiness. i am sti will the same boring, ti amid person i have always been, for whom the idea of any kind of attention from an attractive girl might as well be a fantasy. everyone fucking tells me that it does not work this way. you do not get a partner by putting all your waking effort into it. you just need to do what you like and be open and you ll meet someone. what if i do not want to do anything? or what if me doing what i like is sitting at home, playing video games? i am certainly not going to fucking meet anyone doing that. and i do not do that with any great regularity anymore, because it is an empty fucking hobby, but that is my honest answer. i do not have friends. i do not like friendships. but everyone is also right. i am not going to meet anyone living socially isolated like this. but i do not know how to stop. i am so fucking terrible at social situations. i hate it. i hate myself. i want to die.	moderate
i think i am getting depressed again it is been like years that i live with depression now, it is been a long journey. in i started going to my psychologist and taking pi wills and it helped me a lot to get better, for the next two years i felt pretty good and free from depression, i achieved some of my goals and started a amazing relationship, so i stopped my therapy. but recently i have been dreaming a lot about my traumas from the past, things i hide even from myself, things that make me feel the worst things i ever felt but i also feel that i need to go back to my therapist and face these traumas and try to get over it, but thinking of remembering all of that makes me depressed and melancholic. i feel blue, like i can not get super excited like i used to get some months ago. i do things i need to do to escape and pretend i am not feeling it but it is not working. do not know what to do	moderate
i think i am depressed but being so aware of the symptoms makes me doubt i just broke up with my girlfriend of four years and my family and i are going through a rough financial moment and i feel like i am tearing apart. i barely leave the house, i am not motivated to do anything at all, i spent my days laying on my bed checking my social network feeds since i have no one to talk to since me and my girl broke up, i barely talk at all, i sleep almost hours a day just not to think about anything, basically, i really feel like i am depressed, and i am aware that every single thing i am saying is a sign that i am depressed. but i can not stop thinking that since i know a lot about this subject, because i have had cases real close and i have have investigated a lot, i might be suggesting myself into thinking i am depressed. it is driving me crazy living in this li ambo of sadness, i am crying as i write this, please, help.	moderate

quick kinda rant ig everyone thinks oh depression is just a phase, but it is not. everyone says you re so smart athletic and all good stuff so how can you be depressed, you literally are perfect. everyone around me thinks depression lasts for a bit then it is gone forever, but it is not. they always say oh it wi will be ok, you ll feel better tomorrow. there is always this voice constantly in my head yelling, and smothering any thoughts. people say if you smile and laugh you can not be depressed or depression is sadness. depression is not just being sad, you can smile and be happy. it is hard to even function during depressive episodes. having an episode for me is feeling overloaded or numb completely, i never want to do anything, and i get so exhausted doing anything even just walking across the room. i was diagnosed mid october with clinical depression, but i have reached out to social workers and i am feeling almost ok. telling someone how you feel, releases such a weight off your chest, and you begin to realize it was not your fault for feeling the way you do, it is just a condition you have but you can feel okay if you ask for help. yes, there are many challenges and your support system wi will be there for you, but you have to speak up. tell someone what you re experiencing because maybe you can encourage others too, to not remain silent.	moderate
my christian parent your depression is caused by your lack of religion. i know how to solve your mental issues without a doctor, but you must listen to me. i recently opened up about my depression to one of my parents. i told them not revealing the gender of my parent because i am paranoid about my depression and how these feelings are ruining my life. quickly this conversation turned to religion despite me not wanting to thiscuss it at all. they started trying to emotionally manipulate me with clai ams like you are not religious because you hate me and you re just trying to use me as a tool to see the doctor. a few years ago they even played the classic i have failed as a parent card. gaslighting? eventually it got to the point where they threatened to leave the entire family if i went on anti depressants because supposedly i am going to die of a brain thisease if i take drugs and they do not want to go through that . mind you, i have not even gotten a diagnosis yet, nor have i even mentioned going on anti depressants. they wi will gaslight ? me during typical political and religious arguments too. you do not believe anything i say and you respect these politicians more than me. my parents have given me everything, so i am feeling conflicted just writing this. i need an outside perspective to determine if this is normal or not. what should i do going forward? is my parent a narcissist or something? obviously i need to see a doctor, but i do not want to go through threats of thisownment again.	moderate
is this depression? i am starting to think i have always been depressed, but since i have not known anything else there is not any happiness to compare it with. i remember being very confident and sure of myself around years old, but as i got older and worn down by the emotional neglect not materialistic of my parents, things started to become more dull and lifeless. i do not know if i have been waiting for an event to happen to bring purpose to my life, but now at the only things that really excite me are spontaneous trips booked same day someti ames only hours before or something out of routine. manic? day to day life is boring i am sti will finishing my degree which i think is completely worthless, and i am obsessed with my physical well being and spend almost all of my free ti ame in the gym. when working on the school work, it is like i know i am doing something that i do not want to do so i can get a job doing something i do not want to do. the worst part is knowing that but sti will doing it. i know i do not need to finish school, but perhaps fear of being unsuccessful forever keeps us doing things that better us in theory but hold us back in reality student loans etc. current day i have done some fun things, and i have made enough money to allow me some freedom in my current bout of unemployment. i am good looking and do not have any problem with women, humble brag, but laying foundation, and pipe heheh ..jk but the problem is i get so bored and have no desire to keep anything going. also, sex is not worth it to me no matter how attractive the female. my friends seem to think this is really weird, but i could never have sex again and that wouldn t really bother me much. all in all, i am bored with normal life and get no joy out of anything. i do not have that sense of purpose, passion or yearning towards the potential the future brings like i did when i was , and i feel like i was in a better place then than i am now. i do not knew how to find that thing to look forward to that makes all the bullshit necessary, like if i just grind through a i wi will end up at b in the long run i am also losing interest in anything that does give me joy or make me feel alive, like working out, mainly because of repetition and feeling like i am living the same day over and over. i am consumed by thoughts of wasting my remaining youth and ti ame and having nothing worthwhile to show for it. i am cynical and think my friends want to see me fail when i know that is not true, and that goes for my family as well. so the question is this depression? and if it is, how the flying fuck do i get out of this rut. i can sleep all day, and maintain my physical health based solely on my complete vanity and worry of aging like shit, but can not really be bothered to do much of anything else. also, my body is super stiff and for some reason my walk feels unnatural if that means anything. lastly, i am not sure if i have add or not, but i can not really focus on shit unless i am just starting a new project. after the initial excitement and thoughts of what could come i quickly lose any ability to complete a task. that said, i have tried adderal mg and put si amply, it made me feel like the person i actually want to be. i was confident about my ideas, and my mind felt like it was on my side for once. i have not tried it again, but it felt like it momentarily connected something in my brain that was just lacking. i do not have the mental quickness i used to have and it feels like i have to put in effort to maintain any kind of conversation. coupled with mild social anxiety feels like nobody really wants me around which reflects in my body language and makes me appear like i am angry or standoffish but the people who actually know me would have no idea. also, if it matters. i have a decently large instagram following which forces me to feel like i have to constantly meet and maintain a certain standard of life and appearance in order to keep up with the world. i can not i amagine this helps. thanks!	moderate

any tips for restoring desire and motivation? i am doing much better managing my depression, thankfully, but i am sti will struggling to become a person i can be proud to be. i am sure i am preaching to the choir, but depression has drained me of energy, motivation, personality, desire, and work ethic. i am managing my depression, but i i amagine someone can manage depression only as well as someone who manages living with a missing li amb, or failing senses. you can i amprove your circumstances, but the damage is done. does anyone have suggestions for exercise and dieting? in my case, i get angry during working out. dunno why. maybe any suggestions to avoid becoming overwhelmed at work? i have not had a job in years because i seem to have meltdowns rather frequently in work settings.	moderate

how i am feeling about myself lately idk if r depression is the right subreddit for this post but if there is an r selfloathing i doubt it gets much action. i do not feel good about myself lately at all. i am a year old student who started community college at and am going to graduate this year at . it is because i am, and always have been, a terrible student who does not study and someti ames even cheats with things like chegg and quizlet etc. i did have good grades but then last summer i fked up on a class and just did not do the work and got an f, and now in another class i am going to just barely squeak by with a d can you believe that is considered passing?? . fortunately, my gpa wi will sti will be high enough for me to graduate and i already have a decent full ti amejob in my field so i do not think it really matters. however, i feel like a total loser. you hear all these nice inspiration stories of people who hit rock bottom and then got clean and now are straight a students graduating with honors, or single moms who work full ti ame and sti will manage to keep a . or whatever like that. well that is not me at all and i actually have a pretty cushy life no kids, supportive family, reliable housing, enough money, etc however i am sti will barely getting by in my accomplishments . i do not really think i am very good at much at all except maybe being compassionate which i think is a very good thing however that one thing does not do a whole lot when i am bad at everything else. i had to tell my bf and my mom about me barely passing this class incase i did not actually pass, because that would put graduating back a whole year yikes . i am humiliated and i feel like i have let everyone down by being mediocre at best. i have become super, super sensitive to anything that could be construed as criticism and i think that sjust because my self esteem is in the toilet. unrelated win finally got off effexor after months of dosing down and i am glad it is finally over. love you all so much and i am so thankful there is a place like this where i can say what i want to say without fear of being judged really because none of you wi will ever know who i am plus we re all going through some shit so i think that makes us a bit more sympathetic than others.	moderate
numb i can not remember a ti ame when i was happy. i have been bullied through out my whole school life both physical and mental abuse. i feel numb the second i wake up every day, i have motivation unless i am having a manic episode, even then it only lasts a couple days before something triggers me to fall back in. in i started abusing cannabis and eventually ended up doing xanax, lsd, shrooms, mdma and dmt. i can not really remember those years now but i have stopped doing everything except cannabis. i have also been a daily smoker for most of the ti ame between then and now, cannabis is more of a coping mechanism for me now because if i have a bad day i go home and smoke it ti will i can not keep my eyes open. i have had suicidal thoughts before but never really did anything to try and ki will myself. i have put my life in danger through being intoxicated and driving recklessly. i can not really sleep anymore i get like a maxi amum of hours but most of the ti ame a couple of hours. i have never really had any relationships thought my life resulting in me being and sti will a virgin. i would like to have someone to fall in love with but i do not think that wi will ever happen, i am so damaged that i can not even say i love you to family members. i currently live alone and have a full ti ame job working for my parents. i do not really leave my house unless my only friend begs me to go out with hi am, even then i end up hating myself once i get home. i really hate myself and my life but would not do anything to help myself as i am scared of admitting my feelings to anyone i know. if you a a really read this bs do not roar me too hard. i might want to die but i am too pussy to follow through.	moderate

everyday feels a little more pointless i just do not know what to do anymore. i have nothing to look forward to. and even when i do feelings of inadequacy sti will pop up. wether it be cause of my own stupid mind making up things to be upset about or someone saying something that sparks more negativity. i just can not seem to cli amb out of whatever pit this is i have fallen into. i am tired all the ti ame, i have grown bitter of socializing, especially because i know the people i socialize with for the most part do not really care about me when it boils down to it. i am sad all the ti ame. even when i am happy, i am sad. because i know those moments of happiness wi will be completely forgotten by tomorrow. all the reasons to be joyous wi will be over in an instant. like i said, i have nothing to look forward to. i was looking forward to attending a concert in chicago in june, but i am pretty sure that would not be happening now due to the coronavirus. the band already cancelled the tour for their home country due to it, and it is getting worse over here too. so yeah. looking like the whole tour is going to end up cancelled soon enough. so much for that. i completely respect their decision if they do cancel, but that only solidifies the fact i should not get excited for anything. this is why i do not. because in the end, i am thisappointed. always. i honestly should stop looking forward to anything and everything. and at this point, i pretty much have. life just is not something worth enjoying in my eyes. it is pointless. everyday i wake up and wonder why i even bothered to. everyday i feel like i should not even be here. everyday i want it all to just end completely. and i get more and more reasons to feel that way. i want to go to sleep and never wake up. truly. that would be the only favor the world could ever has ever done for me. just let me be gone. for good. please. remember when i said i had nothing to look forward to? well i lied. it all being over, once and for all, is the only thing i truly look forward to. i genuinely do not fear dying, i embrace the thought. not trying to sound poetic or whatever. just stating how i truly feel. i finally have something to look forward to that absolutely wi will be fulfi willed.	moderate

i feel trapped i feel like i am trapped in between living so i do not have to hurt any of the people i care about and wanting to just die. i am so tired and i feel selfish for making my boyfriend and mom worry about me. it is not fair to them especially when there is nothing they can do for me, i can feel my boyfriend getting tired and i love hi am but i feel like i am hurting hi am by telling hi am how i feel but giving hi am no way to help me, i do not want hi am to feel helpless. i am so scared that i wi will have to keep living like this, i do not know how much more of this i can take. i do not know what else to do, i want a happy future, a happy family and a good job and nice home but it seems so far that it is not even worth wishing for. my mind keeps telling me that if i do die the people around me wi will be fine, it is not fair that i have to live in misery so they can be happy.	moderate
idk if i am i or not i just feel like nothing in my life is going on good .i can not be motivated to go outside at all i blow of my plans i want to do and only to just play xbox on weekends i barley come out of my room . so i tried messaging my dad ,who left me when i was ,for the first ti ame and the thing i fucking got was read receipt and better that he fucking ki willed hi amself a month later and i can not just not correlate the . it is just everything i do i fuck up in my life i mean everything.	moderate
but what is the point why am i forced into this existence against my wi will why do i have to keep living to this notion life is worth something. what even is this, where am i. why did this all have to happen, i never asked or wanted to be here. it is seriously pointless. and i am just stuck here.	moderate
i already had my chances. i am at the end of my rope. i know what i want to do, i know that i could do it if it weren t for other people. and myself. i can see this becoming a normality in the future. suicide. i would rather i did not see it become a normality. every ti ame i desperately cling to some facet of reality, the rest just pulls me back. i can not do it. i was not cut out. too much ti ame has already elapsed. i think it is just about over.	moderate
being alone i feel like i am this happy giggly person when i am around people but the moment i am alone or have a minute to think i get hit with this crushing wave of unhappiness. i can not call it sadness because i am not sad necessarily but unhappy, i do not like my life, i do not like the way i feel and i am just so tired. it is weird its as if my brain stores up all the depression until i am alone just to absolutely fuck me.	moderate
i am always the one to make people laugh and smile but i am dying on the inside and wanting to die anyone else like this	moderate
only feel happy when drunk i fucking hate myself. i hate how i only feel happy when i get drunk. i hate how i have to act fake to appear normal to seem like nothing is wrong. i hate how i think about death and suicide. i hate every about myself. i hate how i only look towards the end of a bottle. i hate everything.	moderate
i feel like i am losing my mind. i had a really traumatic experience about six months ago and i was able to cope with it at first, but things just went out of control. i got addicted to drugs, had lots of pointless hookups, i tried everything to fi will the voids that had been forming in my life but nothing has been working. recently i was told by a therapist that i show signs of ptsd, and i have lots of tics when my anxiety acts up.. and now the most recent thing that has happened is someti ames i hear and see shit and i wi will feel paranoid that i am being watched. everything is getting worse and i do not know what is happening.	moderate
i can not cry anything out it feels as if my emotions have been so far suppressed that i have forgotten what it means to cry. i can not even cry when i want to so desperately. i barely react to things people would usually have a reaction to or i just pretend i care about what they are doing, when in reality i just feel nothing inside. would anyone care to suggest something i can do to stop feeling so empty and let the tears come? i really want to feel something. 	moderate
i can not love myself and idk why... i hate who i am, completely. i do not love my body. i have been told by lots of people that i am ugly and need a bag over my head. people are scared to be friends with me because i look inti amidating. idk but this pain, and loneliness is tiring and for over years i have tried a lot of different way to love myself. my current best friend tried to make me feel better over the years but ends up making me feel like every minor problem is my fault and that i am am the bad guy. i just feel like a total waste of everyone is ti ame and effort.	moderate
so difficult to live in the moment .. i am either thinking about the future and how awful things wi will get . losing loved ones , growing old , having to work everyday until you re . or i am looking back at my past , at great moments that i wi will never experience again in my life . both hurt so much but that is life when you have depression	moderate
message to me hey josh. i know life fucking sucks and this whole depression thing is new to you. i though depression was just being sad and lonely all the ti ame, but boy was i so wrong. its a sickness, a thisease. i can not seem to do things a normal human would be able to do anymore. i was so.. normal. until last year where i just got sick. i can not seem to go out and hang out anymore, or go to the gym. i can not seem to find a purpose in many things. it sucks that dad is business went to shit. it sucks that i had to drop classes to keep up with work and this depression thing. it sucks that she broke up with me because this depression shit was too much for her to handle. i was too much of a burden i guess. i feel bad when friends try to help me too, but i push them away. i just want to be alone for some reason. being alone makes me feel, better?.. more comfortable? i dont know. i feel bad when my two friends surprised me at my house with icecream and to just spend ti ame with me, and i wanted them to leave. i just got off work and i wanted to be alone. i wanted to scream at them to get the fuck out of my house but that would hurt their feelings. i dont know why i am like this. its so weird. why am i just, i amproperly wired? that is just depression i guess. crazy. i finally know why people ki will themselves over this depression shit. it really is miserable. you feel worthless, but can not do shit. i am not at the point where i want to just ki will myself, and hopefully it stays that way. but i have had negative thoughts about it, where i would think like hm it would be easier to just die. i am pretty close to try cutting though. some days like today, i just feel so fucking empty and have no feeling whatsoever. i think cutting would make me feel better by making me feel nothing real holy shit i sound like a depressed guy but its so crazy because i finally understand why people say this stuff lol . yeah cutting would be nice i guess but sis did it in middle school and mom was heartbroken. she had such a hard ti ame trying to figure out what she did wrong and if she was a bad parent. i would hate for mom to suffer again. i love her the most. shes the most valuable thing in my life. yeah i can not let her suffer. i will just keep living life i guess. its so boring and it would be nice to just die but i know that is not it. you can do it josh. one day itll get better you got it king.	moderate
i just do not want to everyone is telling me that i have to want to get better in order to actually get out of my depression. but i do not ever feel like doing it, nor do i want to. it is not as easy as they say. i just feel like there is something wrong with me, besides the obvious. i need the help but i can not stand it when someone tries to give it to me. please tell me i am not the only one.	moderate
untitled. i guess after a year, i can somewhat make some kind of comeback to this subreddit. so much has gotten worse as a year has passed by. everything feels empty right now. i can not exactly pinpoint the base of this pain. nor can i figure out why i tend to force myself to normalize all of these lies i have conjured up in my mind. i want to change, but i do not want to at the same ti ame. i sti will hate myself, so nothing new there. i sound more calm these days, but it scares people whenever i talk about my problems in a casual manner. i have started cutting myself to get a physical reaction so i can bear with that instead of the emotional turmoil that circles around my head. it works, but it is scaring people. i feel bad, but i also do not. there is something wrong with me, that is for sure. i feel like i have given up, but i also feel like i have not. i would like to ki will myself. that would be nice and beneficial towards the people around me. they no longer have to face the constant bullshit i have to give out. yet, i sti will want to live. i want to walk outside early in the morning and hear the birds chirping. the sounds of bushes rustling as bunnies and squirrels past by. the cold breeze brushing over my face. i love that. i can live for that. i feel like i am annoying to everyone. that i am a burden and just cause problems for others. i should just lock myself away from everyone. there is no one that wants to be around me, so i should just lock up every part of my existence away so no one would have to cringe in my presence. even now, i sti will think all of my friends hate me. i do not think i have friends. people lie to you just to see the gratification on your face. that is something i know for a fact. i am absolutely worthless and i am useless to everyone around me. i have no friends. i am basically nothing to the world. it is okay, i guess. i do not even know why i typed this. nothing i say is i amportant anyways.	moderate
can not do that because of this my weight has been bothering me a ton recently, i have reached the most i have ever weighed. i have even noticed quite a bit of thisordered thinking when it comes to my body and weight lately. i am too depressed to find the energy to exercise but my weight is causing me to be more depressed. it is like a never ending cycle and i just want it to end. i can not say this out loud to anyone so i am glad to have at least gotten it off my chest.	moderate

i am really considering suicide i have tried ,and i have been trying for months but everything just gets worse. i am completely alone and all i have are my parents but not even really because they are always fighting so my life is a constant cycle of me hiding in my room. i just do not see anything getting better and i do not see anything fixing this feeling.	moderate
i really miss being a kid i just turned and i have been feeling really nostalgic and overall extremely sad. i have had major depression thisorder since i was , everything before that was great. someti ames i just want to die so i can be reborn or some shit and experience everything again. everything was so much brighter literally even the colors were more vibrant , i looked forward to going to school and learning, playing in my own little world, riding my bike with my best friend, i miss cuddling with my mom on the couch and most of all i miss my innocence and resilience. i did not really have the high school experience and i find myself regretting saying no to hanging out with people. it is fucked up cause i know it is hereditary for me, but i hate myself for allowing myself to be swallowed by my depression. i hate that eventually i am going to die and know that i missed out on so many things.	moderate
broken again i am so fucking done with life now i have nothing it feels like i just got out of a relationship i guess if you call it that but this girl and i were seeing each other like month ago and she broke things off what hurt but it was ok and like a week ago we started to get back together just for me to find out she does not give a fuck about me and she was just playing with my emotions basically for the second ti ame and she had to get her friends to tell me she did not care about me so now i am really broken i do not know how people can just play with others emotions like that	moderate
no one wants me around i am constantly ditched by people i thought were my friend. my roommate and i have the same friends but he is always the one that gets invited places... half the ti ame i never realize he is gone ti will i step out of my room and it is a pretty small house. i have to always be the person that calls my parents otherwise i wi will never hear from them unless it is about my insurance money. and when i do get ahold of them outside that one thing it is a minute conversation all about them and then they have to go. all my other friends outside the group my roommate and i share are constantly too busy to at least talk for a moment, but then i find out they were at the bar or something... maybe i should just stop trying, give in and only leave my room for work. it is not like i have much of a social life anymore.	moderate
unemployed, retail experience, living at home at . never talk to people, broke, deleted social media, it is been over a year... every day i wake up and apply for jobs. i have been turned down hundreds of ti ames even places like mcdonalds walmart so you know it is getting bad. hate how employers see a gap on my resume and throw it out while they give the position to someone with currently working at because they must be a better fit. if i could, i would work at a dead end job with a bunch of young somethings going to college, while i get certificates for a dollars hr hard labor position. even with therapy and meds can not afford there is nothing i can do to land a job because that is up to someone else. at this point in ti ame my peers have great jobs and are in relationships, so there must be something wrong with me. i am not really human.	moderate

should i straight up sit my family down and tell them i do not know how much longer of the fight i have in me? thoughts amp opinions please i have been dealing with gad ocd since a kid. the depression hit at . i tried meds for the first ti ame and it changed my life for four months. i went off not understanding the nature of ads and that they were fixing your brain for the ti ame you re on them. i had a year where i was good and told myself to always remember what it felt like being pulled out of that pit and how irrationally i was thinking wi will it seemed completely logical depressed . i sank bank the following year. i i ammediately sought therapy and see a wonderfulllll psychotherapist. it is been years and none of the meds have worked. i tried the same one, and followed up with ssris snris, and mood stabilizers. my journal entries have not changed much in all this ti ame. i am a shell of what i used to be.. truly. i am enrolled in a clinical trial for psilocybin which i have not heard back from in months now since they had to change their guidelines. but if this does not pull through or does not work, i am feeling boxed in and on my last legs. i have done bloodwork for odd things all out of pocket just to see if there was any i ambalances, etc. and it all comes back great. i can not picture another , , years of this. since i was my goal has always been to just make it to . how do you explain to people your life goal is to literally just stay alive? i worked in a hospital on the mh floor and saw how broke the system is. my question is now this do i literally sit my family down and tell them i do not know how much longer i have left in this fight? do i break down how i got here? it wi will shatter their hearts and mine, but i think it is justifiable. or is it cruel?what else is cruel is just thisappearing into the night and them always having questions about why i did what i did. i am not actively planning this right now, but know it is inevitable unless a miracle comes. i played years of football and was a notorious hitter and wonder if that also plays a role i am a brain donor to the boston cte brain bank in the case of something happening to me randomly . neither of my parents are depressives and it ki wills them to see what a toll my issues have always taken on me. they understand it is a real issue but can not relate. they are supportive. them and my siblings are the only reasons i am sti will here. i really want to sit them down and break down how i have actually tried and taken the necessary steps. how i have things i want to try, but if those things too do not pan out then... to inevitable brace for it in ti ame. i feel so cruel just writing that, but i think they deserve to know. it is like battling a terminal i willness.	moderate
brain refuses to be happy around months ago, a year relationship of mine ended pretty shitly, but my life is great. i have got friends and family that are extremely supportive, i am doing well at the degree i want and my future is, honestly, pretty solid. but every fucking day, i wake up with this heavy feeling in my chest, that it is all pointless and meaningless. i feel like i have to constantly fight this bitter nihilism every second and it is making me feel very miserable inside. i can not tell if it is the breakup or i might just be depressed come to think of it i have never been really happy for the past years or maybe even both. but someti ames it is literally unbearable. i have tried to ki will myself three ti ames within the last months but the third one realising that i just can not do it dw i would not try anymore . so like i said, my life is great, i just do not feel like i actually should be here, alive.	moderate

i just dont know anymore i feel like for the past years since i am about to be i just have been going through the motions. i wake up go to school or work, work out most days to ward off the insecurity and avoid being truly alone with my thoughts and do little else outside of that i have tried more ti ame in nature hiking , i have tried meds and or diet exercise, i practice mindfulness and some meditation, i commit myself wholeheartedly into my work and serving others, i reach out and support any who know me and need a hand or reassurance or just someone to turn to, i have been trying. i have been working on me for a solid two years now to where i feel i have conquered my true demons but the negativity, the self doubt, the self hatred, the apprehension with being vulnerable are sti will there...and i truly dont know how to shake them. i was managing it and felt like i was doing marginally better and then i got fucking burned again and naturally now i am burnt out again i can feel the urge to lash out at those close to me coming back, i can feel the urge to just quit, i can feel the desire to just give up for good and that thought haunts me. i always say i would never do it but every lost friend, every stressful day, every heartbreak just pushes me closer and fucking closer i can not fucking do it anymore...i am not strong enough. i drove around from about midnight to now almost am tonight i guess this morning just trying to shake the pain...trhing to avoid going home laying in bed and being alone with my thoughts...no one i reached out to answered no one ever seems to be there i am just done...i am fucking done	moderate

why am i sti will here? rant unfortunately, i have been sad most of the memorable parts of me life. yeah i have felt moments of joy, but even in those moments or shortly after, this darkness takes over. even as a kid everything seemed so much darker and lonely than it should have. medicine has not been working, and it is been just over a year since i got out of a hospital and all my fun diagnoses, and only several months since i stopped a spiral of substance abuse and self harm. i have at least gotten control of i ampulsivity down, but mainly because i just do not want to end up back in a hospital and fussed over, and unfortunately i am not going to lie, substance abuse and self harm was so much easier than dealing with what i feel, because it was at least one way to get out of my head, even temporarily. i keep trying to fake being fine to everyone, but even then i always feel alone. even when i am surrounded by people i care about, i feel alone. i do not think it is worth living every day of my life feeling so helpless and miserable. i even feel like i am wasting my ti ame finishing college. i want to be an art teacher so i can connect to and help kids that were like me in high school and younger, who have no one to help them work through traumas and feelings. but what help can i really be if i can not even help myself? i feel like i wi will be lying to them if i say it gets better. so what is the point, i can not save anyone, not even myself. i guess i am sti will around because that is just what i am supposed to be doing and so i would not thisappoint my family. i am even in a new relationship that seems healthy and the complete opposite of my first relationship over a year ago. but in the end i can not help but overthink that it is just a matter of ti ame before they leave too, and i feel that no one could ever love me that much, because i can not get past stupid trauma from guys in the past. i was already depressed before crap happened, but i guess that is what i get going to the first person who acted like they wanted to be there for me. spoiler he did not actually want to be there for me. i feel gross, objectified, useless, and broken, and unfortunately those feelings got worse when i learned the hard way that most guys, at least in my experience, are not actually gentlemen and moral, and wi will take advantage of you and your feelings. i have had really bad body i amage issues for years, and i know it is because of that stuff. i take vyvanse for adhd one of the many things wrong with me , and it is honestly really wearing me down, but i do not want to stop taking it because it is the only thing that makes me feel skinnier and hate myself less. i know it is a bad way to live, but i sti will can not control how i feel and learn to love myself or feel beautiful, and despite being aware of my feelings and why they are there, and that they are unnecessary, i can not change the fact that they would not leave. i know i am a human with issues and emotions, but i am just tired of feeling so exhausted and drained all the ti ame. one thing that would help would be for someone to hold me and comfort me and be there no matter what and not take advantage of me, but here i am, alone. i need to learn how to be fine on my own, and how to want to, because i have learned the hard way you can not count on anyone except yourself, and i just need to grow the hell up. you can not always just go running back to mommy or rely on a relationship. i get that i am young and i ammature and unstable and have a lot of growing up to do, but i do not want to. i amagine the feeling of really wanting to go home, where you re comfortable and able to relax, but nowhere is home, so you re just stuck there, constantly craving an escape. i feel like i am being forced to exist with no way out that does not cause others damage. also that is why i am here, posting on a community of strangers, because i do not have anyone to vent to, and i am sitting here trying to write down whatever is in my head instead of relapsing and turning to old habits. i am tired of fighting this battle. end useless rant.	moderate

day of talking about my depression there is a fairly large portion of people in society who do not take depression seriously , it seems unfair that those who suffer are the victi ams and do not get the help they need because of thos people in society judging them so starting from today i have decided to talk about my depression in order to not only help myself as i was classed as a suicidal person which is fairly true but i also want to help those who suffer and dont let anyone know. day the truth is told if i am asked to recall how long i have depressed i would usually say around months but in reality it is close to years , what people realise is that when they talk once they say something it is very difficult to take it back and word even can destroy a individual is emotions no matter how its phrased. i was lucky i said i wanted to die while in school otherwise i am scared i might have gone through with it and i was very lucky to have a supportive friend who has been through something si amilar and then all the people i trust aswell trying to help confidence , i have spent around of my life inside as i suffer from anxiety so i am scared of being alone in this world. people can be heartless creatures who do not give a dam about ones feelings.this is because is society thos who want to be popular for their own gain are the ones who are cold to everyone else because in society if you have looks you have a chance to speak. people who are under the age of are only just starting to get a voice, human kind has been around for more than , years and only within the last years our plea for help is being heard because of the geniuses who find ways to make our voice heard i like photography it is a way for me to feel free because it allows be to see the beauty in things people dont really see but if you look closer even the ugliest of places can be beautiful. i appreciate that there are people in my life who want to support me and do so but i want to help make a difference in our society we get classed as people with thisorders and every who gets called is essentially getting called and outcast of society and that we dont belong in it because we are different. but different better right?	moderate
i just need to type right now instead of thinking about how to ki will myself yo. fucked up my life. professionally i am ok. everything else a thisaster. lost all my friends over the years, havent been in a relationship in many years. i spent an ungodly amount of ti ame alone. isolated. sticking my head in the sand with my problems because i did not know how to handle them by myself. finally started going a therapist last week and turns out i have borderline personality thisorder. most likely from a life of no one giving a fuck about me including my family. now my dad is dying from cancer which showed up in my brother years ago and now i have a spot on my shoulder that looks just like the marks on my dad. i have such low self esteem i rarely look at myself in the mirror and this mark was a speck months ago. just looked last night for the first ti ame and instead of going away it is bigger. i am freaking out about this more than anything at the moment. i am might have an insane tax problem that was out of ignorance if it is true, not intentional and i can not even find anyone to help me with that. i barely have friend who i rarely see. i had such high expectations for my life and i sat and watched the years go by instead of achieving my goals of a wife and kids and a career i loved. instead it is am and i am totally alone and havent even talked to a human in days which is the norm. i am living a solitary confinement life with an internet connection. i want to end myself but i am scared because i know it is permanent. i do not get to come back years from now and try again. at the same ti ame i honestly want to die more than anything. i can not keep fighting anymore when i have nothing to live for at all. people can reply here or i can call a hotline even a social worker who was calling me consistently after i told her my story just stopped calling when she knew i did not have anyone else. she has not called me since i started the therapist . i am serious, i do not know what to do. the pure panic, the pure abandonment,..how do i get the courage to finally end my life. i do not want to do it but the alternative is worse.	moderate

i am being haunted by my past. yeah, title says everything. i am haunted by what i have done and what i have had. i am ordinary college student, living in seoul, and loves to eat. i should start from where i was elementary school kid. i was lazy and naive and kind of pathetic. i did not study, did not prepare things i should do like homework , and ignored by other people in school. i was dirty too. the problem is i did not fix til these days, and i do not know what to fix and how to fix my life. to make a reason for this, i have had serious anxiety since i was , and have been bullied by kids. i was seriously bullied that the pain sti will keeps following me til these days and someti ames i want a revenge. i made a post about this on r confession but taken down. i think it is due to violent title. but on the other hand, i was bully too when i was elementary school kid. and someti ames i have done some horrible things til this day. i want to apologize for what i have done and i deserve the guilty now. it feels like my heart being stabbed. the problem is almost all i think in my life is about these things and i am suffering from it. depression allied my past thought and they are ki willing me slowly. but the reality is worse. i have nothing to be good at, and want nothing to do. my father soon retired at the job but all i do is getting more pathetic and having more and more self pity. everything seems to be negative. what should i do? thank for reading this post to the end despite of boring content and bad english	moderate
i dont know what to do i am feeling so lost. i stopped going to therapy for a few months now and i guess i just dont know who to vent to. so here it goes. i really just want to end it all but i know that is not the path i need to take. so why am i feeling this way to where i need to act fake. i know i should be grateful and be happy for all that i have. so why is it that i can not see a clear path. maybe i just need to take a deep breathe and see things straight. but i am worried in the process that i might break. please can someone or anything help me see things clearly. before i make a decision that might ki will me. i want to be happy. i dont want to be sad. so why is the thought of being dead making me feel so bad. am i afraid of the unknown. or is it the feeling of being so alone. i dont know. i am just typing all my feelings on this fucking phone. i try to find the good in life and not look things so dark and gray. i am not even religious but i think i might start to pray. is there a reason for why i feel this way. maybe. i dont know. i just want better days. sorry for all the rhymes. i guess it is the only way i can really express myself without feeling so stupid or down. i am just feeling so lost i dont know who to turn to. all i know is my therapist wasnt helping yet here i am fighting for a life i dont feel worth fighting for. thanks for reading.	moderate
i am suffering from incredible stupidity causing my depression, but if i tell anybody i wi will be in for a guaranteed horrible experience please do not say but you can type this message because autocorrect has fixed every word for me. i am stupid. very very very stupid, like people years younger than me are smarter at basic things than me, and more aware of the world. i have no friends, no local family, no respect from my family, no talents, no achievements, i failed most of my education, and i can not work because i am physically unwell with a breathing difficulty. unfortunately my gp has always thought my breathing is due to just stress despite them testing for other things that prove a physical cause. as a result, i was locked in a mental hospital and only got out when my mother was passing away. it was the worst experience of my life and taught me to never actually admit to being stressed or depressed if it ever truly happened. fast forward to today and its happening. whether its daily life, playing games, finding love or even tying my shoes, i sti will fail at everything. i was even fired from a voluntary job. people sti will bully me in the streets for everything about myself at age . i took an iq test that only proves further how stupid i am. everything adding up at once means i now actually do suffer from depression, unlike before. unfortunately if i admit this to anybody, especially my family or gp, they wi will put me back in the mental hospital. this is not just paranoia, many doctors keep telling me i belong there thinking i am just making up my breathing difficulties. i promise on my mother is grave my troubles are real and proven, but nobody wi will listen. where can i go for help without drawing attention from the wrong people? i can not keep my depression bottled up but i am too stupid to know how to avoid being locked up in the mental hospital again.	moderate
if i actually want to ki will me, certain but are too pussy to do it. where should i look? i am too scared of the afterlife. how wi will eternity in nothingless feel like and all that.	moderate
that deep dark horrid feeling in the pit of your stomach you know things are real bad when you lose all interest in things that once made you so happy. i used to be able to spend hours..days in fact tending to plants but now it feels like a chore to water them even. watching them wither like my mental health is pretty upsetting. and it is ironic in fact because things have been a lot better lately than before. i have started to be productive again and have achieved a lot more than i have in the past few years. some good influences are to thank for that. but i feel worse than ever..i have even lost my sense of humour.. i do not see the reason why i feel this way. .but the academic pressure as well as worry about my future gets to me. the fact i wi will lead a thoroughly mediocre life is absolutely thisheartening. and the only solace is the fact that ti ame passes by so soon and life wi will be over before we know it. and do not even get me started on my anxiety. i wake up with palpitations someti ames and have to calm myself down thinking it is not all that bad. and theres no substantial reason to feel this way too. my faith is the only thing that is kept me going so far and praying definitely helps but the days i miss out on doing that makes me feel like i am undeserving of god is help. i surely try to keep the negative thoughts at bay. i love my body again after a struggle with body positivity. it might sound cliche but i comfort myself with verses and try to be hopeful and strong. i have survived worse after all. i have helped a few poeple i have been close to get out of their depression but can not seem to get myself out of it.	moderate

just when you think it could not get any worse, it conveniently gets worse people say that ti ame heals, i wish that were true. as ti ame goes on, i feel worse than the day before. the battles between me and depression become harder, and i am less resilient. the worst thing about it, is that all my wi will power is spent on keeping depression at bay and i have nothing left for any of life is battles. as ti ame goes by, i feel more thisconnected from reality, and i find it harder to cope with the monotony of every day. there just never seems like there is an end.	moderate

i do not know what to do anymore. i want to ki will myself sorry for my bad english. i am a yo male and always had lots of good friends and was really good at school. at least until about years ago. i switched to a new school and lost all my friends, because they stayed at my old school. i got to know a dude l ll call hi am a that was in my class and we got best friends. that year my grades suddenly got really bad and forgot a lot of homeworks. my math teacher was not that nice and some people in my class including me were really scared of her. i got bullied, got only one to two friends and my grades were bad. all of that lead to my depression. at least i had a as mental support. some ti ame passed and the relationship between me and my parents got worse, because they were getting calls from my teachers about my bad grades. to all of that i had an argument with a. l can not remember what it was about but now he does not really like me anymore, which really hurts because i have known hi am for a few year now and always considered hi am as my best friend. so now i do not really have friends anymore, i got depression and bad grades and the relationship between me and my parents is really bad. honestly i am crying very often because i do not know what to do anymore or just had a really bad day. i just want to ki will myself. my last hope is to make it to a new school, where i attended, because there i would have subjects like coding , which i really like. i could also have some new friend. the only problem is that i have a which is a d in the uk i guess in subjects and the school i want to go to, has a lot of requests from students with better grades. and now i am sitting in front of my pc or crying in my bed when i am not in school. i just want someone to talk to and hug.	moderate
i am doing it now goodbye someone 	moderate
 , with years of night. i walk at night. not to one place or another, just around. i used to cli amb the fence to the cemetery near my house, but i am not a kid anymore and it would look too weird to anyone that spotted me. i used to though, and it was nice in there. now i walk down to a channel that runs through my college town. it is nice but homeless people call out in the dark, lost in their own issues and drug altered states of mind. it is not dangerous. the homeless are almost always afraid, even the ones that act aggressive when you surprise them. most of them know me now, not my name but because they have seen me there, down by the water, lumbering along like a tall ghost. one of them slowly raises his hand when he sees me. i raise my hand in return a slow greeting and goodbye in a single, wordless gesture. i have it good. there is no reason for these long hushed walks. i am comfortable in life. my girl is a saint, my parents are loving. nothing damaging, beyond what life takes from all of us, has happened to me. i used to talk about the night walk, the depression, but i eventually found that no one had a cure, no one could comfort the human condition. so i stopped letting others know. my parents talk about my depression in the past tense, which i prefer. allowing them to think it was just a short term issue makes me feel good, as if i am preforming a service, just letting them go on without worry. i owe them at least that much. i have tried drug, legal and i willegal, in an attempt to sooth my mind, or shift it to a lighter setting, but not change that core aspect of me. the philosophy held out against a hazmat truck load of alcohol, psychedelics, uppers, pi wills, and balls to the wall adrenaline doses that would split a lions heart in two. it did not change anything, except making stand up comedy better. if you have not tried drugs, just know they wi will not fix anything. i never got addicted to any of it, only gained the knowledge that drugs are a temporary alteration and even hallucinating that your brain is in control of the flight patterns of migratory birds gets to be a calm sort of normal after a while. skip it. i wi will be out there tomorrow night. wool coat and scally cap, bushy beard and worries on my mind. if you see me, do not raise your hand, no hello goodbye. if there are answers, i do not have them.	moderate

i feel completely numb now. what is wrong with me. yesterday, the one person i loved the most in this world told me she did not know if she wanted to be in a relationship with me anymore after i asked. i really have no idea what i did wrong. maybe i am just not meant to be a boyfriend for anyone. she also feels forced into this relationship. that is the last thing i ever wanted. she says it is because i put her on the pedestal too much. i just love her so much and like telling her how much she helps me. i do not know how long she is felt like this. but maybe it is best i release her. and if i do. i am not sure i want to get in any other relationship after this. i do not think i am good for it. i do not need to worry about people leaving me if their not there in the first place. maybe it is best for me. i can not believe it if i were to be completely honest. i thought it was so well. i really can not even believe she said that to me. it really hurt. happens i guess. just was not expecting her to do it to me. realistically she is only a girl. anyone can do this. i accept it. i would not be breaking up with her though. she wi will have to do it to me. i made i promise that i would never leave as long as she allows me to stay. so i would not leave. i am sure she wi will leave me in the near future though. i guess i am ready for it. i do not have feeling anymore i feel. my educations falling apart. my job sucks and might lose it soon. i recently got kicked out of my house. i just do not care what happens to me anymore. maybe i am one of the people that was just meant to not be happy. maybe i am wrong somewhere here. but as i said, i do not care. take everything as you wi will. sorry for blabbing. see you later internet.	moderate
i tried to ki will myself on monday night. for the first ti ame ever, i did not chicken out or try to seek help. it did not work. not sure where to go from here. i have made a bunch of suicide attempts over the past years, but usually i chicken out by telling someone and or going to a hospital. this was the first attempt i have made in years, and i did not stop myself. i looked up the lethal dose for the pi wills then took twice that. i felt so happy, so relieved. finally, my life would be over. but instead, i spent that entire night in an excruciating amount of pain, curled up by the toilet, puking my guts out until all i had left to vomit was my stomach bile. in the morning, i finally stopped throwing that up too. i called in sick to work and told them i had the flu. my boss was not thri willed with me because i was supposed to be in at am and did not email her until pm. but she said she was mainly worried, because it was so unlike me. three of my coworkers texted me to see if i was okay. i was not expecting that, i did not realize they actually cared. i had a call with my therapist yesterday, and i did not tell hi am. i told hi am that my mental health has tanked, and that i was sick in bed with the flu. and without knowing what i would already done, he said he was worried about my mental state and asked if i had suicidal thoughts. i told hi am i did, but that i had not settled on a good method for suicide yet, so he had nothing to worry about. that is true, i guess. i sti will do not have a good method. i sti will do not want to live. but i also can not even think about attempting again right now. as i waited for the pi wills to take effect, i knew that i would have stomach problems so i chewed on candied ginger and drank chamomile tea. now i can not smell either without getting nauseous. for others who have gone through with an unsuccessful suicide attempt, what did you do next? i do not necessarily mean in terms of executing a plan, i just mean like in life. do you just go back to work once the physical side effects have worn off and pretend like everything is fine? did you do something drastic like buy a plane ticket and pack up your shit? or do you quit your job and turn into even more of a hermit? before you suggest it, i am not going to tell anyone in real life what i have done. i can not put my friends and family through this shit again, not unless it is finally over.	moderate
friends.. maybe? i do not want to give up. i do not really know what so say here.. after reading some posts i feel like nobody would care for another ranting post around here. well.. it is the first ti ame for me to really reach out for someone or something via text so i have no idea how it turns out.. but we all here, who write these texts about us, show that even if we say we have given up already, that some parts of us are fighting against it. otherwise we would not even bother to post something here. i thought i could mention my fu ed up past, but i know we all had our share of troubles and our package to carry.. i just feel like.. that i can not carry mine alone anymore. i am tom. i am and probably in depression since i was years old. but month ago i finally found the courage to go to the doc and sort stuff out and arrange a therapy. to give you the basics of me here the following around years ago i had to give up my own appartment because the friends i was living with betrayed me money wise. first they used to live with me for years without paying rent. then when i said i could not hold up anymore for the of us they guaranteed me that they support me and pay rent at least. in the end they both left me with k debt each that they never payed back and left before the ship sank, leaving me the captain in this metaphor to sink with the appartment. why i did not do something about it earlier was si amply because i was living there with them since i was . i was lonely.. i felt absolutely the need to have someone around even if they did not care. more like i put puppets in my puppet house so at least it feels lively. at least the light is on when i came home right?.. well so after this happened an old childhood friend picked me up, let me move in together with her and gave me the chance to fix up stuff again. but in a new city, without any friends, quitting my job in the moving process and kinda lost motivation and sight of what would give me progress i fell into a hole i could not get out with anymore. i left the appartment, the people and the money behind me and tried my best to move on. which brings me to the present.. what i miss the most is having friends.. having someone to talk to. share interests. play games together. watch ani ame or whatever. but being now.. feels like i am so god da old already that all the connections a teenager has to push up his social life just dont work anymore for me. or at least i feel completely out of place and totally weird when i attempt to meet other people, go out etc. which makes me only leave the appartment for appointments, or walking with my dog. i feel completely lost. i am way to emotionally unstable currently, pretty much crying whenever my eyes and body feel like it. i sti will have hobbies, people to talk to, stuff to pretty much entertain me.. but these people are not real friends and all the entertainment starts to feel hollow.. but i am able to hold proper conversations. i am able to share some fun! i try my very best to not give up. i push suicidal thoughts away for so many years already, i do not want to give up yet!! ulti amately.. i think what i wanted to say is.. i am suffering from depression.. trying to avoid taking meds against it, giving my best to fight but i feel so alone that it becomes harder and harder.. it is very hard in this situation to find friends, be it male or female and as you can guess even harder to find any females that would take interest in you.. i would appreciate any sort of.. advice?.. i guess. or even people approaching.. i dunno.. thank you for reading! really..	moderate
my brain is so dopamine fried that i became depressed by constantly checking my muscles after workouts and noticing i have not gained much makes me want to stop altogether and just lay in bed. i know this whole title sounds like a joke but i literally want to cry over this. this makes me ashamed. i fucking hate how my body looks even though it is considered normal . i want to be more muscular and it is just not happening. plus muscle i ambalance is fucking with my brain too constantly feels like my right arm is more muscular even though i try to train my left more . it is just not good looking and it bothers me so much i want to stop altogether. the sole reason i wanted to do this is to have more be adequate since girls in my class have commented on how they would never date me one literally blatantly said if she had to choose between me and being single she would choose to be single all i do right now are pushups and not that many maybe a day. nowhere near enough to get anywhere. it just all feels so pointless but at the same ti ame i need to do it or else i wi will be alone forever. it just makes me so thisappointed knowing i do not experience anything. i do not even want to continue because idk if i am doing it right. i have no idea if i should have posted this to r bodydysmorphia or this but i choose this since it is more related to my depression and unmotivatidness. i have no idea how to combat this.	moderate
a strange depression. this is a throwaway. i have much on my shoulders, i just need to get it off. and i have nobody else. i mean, nobody. very first post, please be reasonable. i have been battling this since i was . folks died within a month or two apart. i was sent to live with my guardian. i have since been lost, wandering the world in search of a purpose. i am overweight, not athletic. not good at much. i know a lot about ani amals though, they were always something i could let my mind delve into. i would dream of filming all the ani amals across the globe. but i knew it wouldn t happen. i tend to be pessi amistic. forgive me. my guardian who raised me basically tried their best, know they did. but they were just too old and out of the parenting game to really do much. so i was left with no guidance. no way to determine who i would be. sure i had family who had taken me out for fun nights at dinners, sleepovers with cousins. the usual. but back then, it seemed to be a daze of things. i felt the world spinning around me and my little bubble, where i wouldn t escape, but i could see everything taking shape around me. i wrote a lot, i cried, a lot. i stayed hidden away a lot. i just tried to be happy for everyone else, because i did not want to burden them. i went through all types of counseling. it seemed to dull the pain from ti ame to ti ame. in my adult life, i ran rampant. i did not do drugs other than smoke some pot which helped me with anxiety. i did not have any children sti will do not . i have been married for almost years to someone who has helped so much but also has issues of their own which tend to shake me. i feel like a shaken soul. just spinning around the earth, hearing, seeing, smelling and observing all the lives amongst me. i have not genuinely given up, but i certainly have lost much hope. i do believe in god, but it is not some crazy church bullshit. i believe we are created to serve a purpose. and i do not blame god because of free wi will. we all have obstacles and how we choose to deal with them is what helps define us and define our character please do not bash, i wouldn t dream of harming someone else for their beliefs. i think you should be free to explore any beliefs you should choose. that is our choice i am just in this whirlwind of struggle, anger, numbness to an extent. i have thought about dying, but i do not want to ti will it is my body is natural ti ame. ti will i run my clock out. i could not dream of taking my life because there is so much beauty i do get to see, and i enjoy the happiness of others. it is about what drives me. but down inside, into the very core is pain. tears, anger, hatred, and self loathing. i am trying to fight it each day with positivity but it is never enough. i just want to feel normal. if there is such a thing... sorry for the long post and it might be really spotty. i am kinda having a dark moment here, and thoughts tend to get foggy... thank you for reading you guys. stay supportive of those needing the shoulder.	moderate

i stopped worrying about dying, ya know i just do not really think i care anymore. i have hit a point where i go to sleep at night and just hope i do not wake up. the stress i have been feeling for years has just all built up. i stopped living every day like it is my last and instead live everyday like i wish it was. i do not want to ki will myself, but i am not exactly wishing myself the best. i am started on zoloft so it could just be the side effects of that. just wanted to see if anyone else feels this way. as i notice most people do not really care ti will your on the cusp of mortality, and not just in the li ambo of living	moderate
coping with a normal life and depression m...i have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years now to the point where i am constantly thinking about death.. i feel like i have developed some kind of relationship with it.. to my main point.. i am expected to make big decisions about my future but as much as i have tried giving a normal life a chance, i always end up back on my bed crying myself to sleep literally every night or choking myself in the bathroom at work just to feel the pain i guess... what i am saying is that as much as i try.. i can not seem to cope with life anymore.. and as close as i have been to opening up to the people closest to me.. i just can not... i can not figure out a way to explain to people and someti ames to myself why exactly i am stuck in the way i am.. cause as long as i am in this mindset, as much as effort i put in and as hard as i work and learn... i sti will always end up on my bed crying with a hand full of tranxene trying to decide wether to swallow them all or not...	moderate

depression has made me superstitious logic always wins from what humans make up, that is what i thought before i slipped into depression. now i think i am seeing things, but on the other hand, i also think they may be true, and the doubt is torture. i think people hate me, and that i am a lower being who was born wrong, destined to suffer every day. and when things seem to go a little better, life just takes it away from me and laughs. i have started to believe there is something that likes to see me suffer, likes to give me hope just to take it away again, and again, and again. everyday pain has become normal. wanting to isolate myself, even though i am so lonely and i hate every moment of it, that is also a problem. and nothing of it matters. in the end, why would i try anything? why would i bother writing on a digital platform where people i have never met or heard of are everywhere? and i got so tired of all the cheap, quick fix advice i get, all the exercise, sleep enough, eat healthy, live laugh love bullshit. if it were that easy, i would never have been like this. i do not even think i am capable of being a normal person anymore. if i do not go mad or put myself out of my misery, somehow, i wi will wear the scars of this for the rest of my life. so i guess, whoever read this ti will here, sorry for making you sad too. i did not mean to, and it is unlikely his wi will help in any way in the end.	moderate
just another post uh? so uhm, it wi will be difficult to express everything since english is not my mother tongue but i wi will try. for starters, i am a young lad from italy and right now, my whole country is in a lockdown to the recently covid . at the beginning of it, i did not care much since i do not have an active social life but, this morning out of the blue, a panic attack came. needlessy to say that my mind gave me a hard ti ame, i kid you not, i could hear literally a bunch of voices screaming and whispering phrases such as what if the whole world wi will collapse because of this pandemic or what if your country does not get back on track? . of course, this was not the first ti ame i had a panic attack, the record history goes back to early when i first fell into this black void of emotions and despair. in that year i had countless problems such as my parents executive eviction from the house where i grew up years . my ex classroom was full of bullies which made going to school a living hell every day. shortly after i began to cut myself up, in many ways. it was my only coping method for the pain i felt on a daily basis and somehow, i have considered this as some sort of punishment for being myself. the only brighter side was my best friend, i owe her a lot since she was always there for me when i wanted badly to end my life or just the bad moments. but of course, nothing good lasts in my life. we argued at some point because i was uncapable of showing affection. flaw that came back a few years later, when i got engaged. same issue, same end i pushed her as i am pushing my few friends to hate me to sweeeten the goodbye but it did not worked. she left and in that period i was all alone so i took a really bad decision. dropping out of school. at the start it seemed good for my mental health but right now, it is coming back to bite me since i did not graduate. finding jobs in italy is not a piece of cake and even the graduates can not find a proper job, so how could i? i do not know if our economy wi will be back enough to grant me something since i am a weight for my sister and brother. i would not mention my parents because they are from a really old generation and lemme say this some couple are not suitable for raising children. my brother keeps entrusting me of looking out for them and as a son, it does not bother me. it is my way of compensate for having a roof upon my head italian figure of speech and my sister, is paying my internet connection, monthly. this is the worst part, knowing that she has a family of her own and i am here, literally asking for money. it is not a lot but...you know even dollar euro would weight on me returning on the main topic the attack was also caused by my i ammagination of the future for my nephews and nieces. since we all know what the global warming and pollution are doing to our planet i am fucking scared. i do not care about me, never did but when they came into my life i have started looking out for them. they are my pride and joy, absolutely. thinking of the future is haunting, i do not have any particular ski wills, i am not good at anything. i am a really mediocre person, maybe even low than the average human being, but mostly, i am a f king walking failure. i am spending most of my nights awake and thinking of the same things that pursue me from years ago. reminding of every little mistake i have made in my life. i am young and i should enjoying these years another figure of speech but i do not have pleasent memories and i am just full of regrets. i am a mess and at this point, crying does not help me anymore. i did everything wrong and i want another chance at life but that is just pure fantasy. i do not know what i should be doing right now internet. i am wasting ti ame by the ti ame. i do not know.	moderate

depression self loathing amp accepting it today i had a friend call me and tell me the reason shes been avoiding me keeping her thistance. i insulted her and her mom. i came over her house a while ago and made comments that they did not like. at the ti ame, i was unaware of how what i was saying could offend them. it could be the delivery, the tone, etc. i have done this multiple ti ames throughout friendships and they usually end. part of me wants to defend myself of course apologize sti will but i feel as tho i let alot of shit slide when ppl make comments to me or say things that hurt my feelings. i let it slide. but i am not given that grace. the other part of me agrees that i am a total shitbag. the fact i may not notice what i am saying makes me worse. like i am innately evil, rude, selfish,etc. i am at the point i am ok with losing all my friends. that i do not deserve them. that i dont deserve companionship. i deleted my instagram. i am going to change my number. i want to be a shut in. just go to work and come home and stay in my room. i dont want to hurt anyone else feelings. i dont want to be known as a bad friend. i rather have no one then hurt people.	moderate
it is getting worse title says it all. used to have episodes only about or ti ames a week, now it is increased to ti ames a day, someti ames more. i feel like i am going insane, everything hurts. i have started drifting away from my friends, it is ok whenever i can keep my mask up and act like there is nothing wrong but as soon as i get home from school it is there, a constant feeling that i do not belong, that they are better off when i am not there. used to just be a feeling but it has started to become my reality. i am scared. i am closer than ever to jumping off a bridge, or whatever way i am going to do it, i have not felt like planning anything. i realize nothing you say wi will help me, but at this point i am just craving attention.	moderate
the coronavirus is worsening my depression. because of the coronavirus i can not leave my house. i already have no friends, no hobbies, nothing to do ever. but now i am trapped in my house all day every day for the foreseeable future. it is not just that i am not allowed to leave, i also have a horrible fear of getting sick. so even if i had the ability to go to school or go to work, i wouldn t. i never have anything to look forward to at all in my days anymore though. i just lay around, feeling like shit, waiting to get tired so i can go to sleep and escape this misery.	moderate

i want to quit. i moved out of the city back to my family home because i was self harming and financially i was in an overdraft albeit arranged and it seemed like i was better off at home than living in the city. had a rough ti ame of my masters degree it was in cognitive neuroscience so i have to resit an exam and i am working a few unpaid internships to get research experience, i have a job working in a pub but the hours are not great so if i earn in a month that is considered amazing to me. i am expecting half for this month. i feel like i am expected to keep up financially via social events with my friends and buy drinks that i really just can not afford without it damaging my financial situation. my parents are sick of me living at home and want me to move out, i am trying to get this masters degree finished so i can just move on with my life and i feel like i am now just going backwards mentally where before i was coming on so well. i self harmed the other day because i felt so low, my financial situation faced a few setbacks having to pay tuition fees that i can just about afford, it just set me backwards into the overdraft which is not that big of a deal, my parents are always angry at me, i literally feel so low and crappy and hardly have any energy anymore. another friend of mine is trying to get me to get romantically involved with someone which i am all for but because of what happened in the city and in therapy i now have a fear of inti amacy and really struggle to have inti amate romantic relationships. just for example one ti ame a girl mentioned going on a date with me and it made me feel so uncomfortable. my family and friends have told me often how much it upset them when they found out that i was self harming and now i do not feel like i can tell them that i self harmed the other night because of how it would make them feel. i literally just feel like a massive fucking loser. i am and have next to nothing to show for it and i just want to give up on everything that i am doing.	moderate
have not posted here for roughly years and it is not because i am better it is because i have been pretending. i am realizing i wi will probably always be pretending to be okay. and most people in my life wi will never understand the way my mind works. a couple of years ago i deleted most of my posts from here and tried to force myself to get better. tried to pretend like i was not crumbling on the inside. i convinced myself that i was not depressed or suicidal anymore. not going to lie and say that i did not have my moments of sadness but i got better at pushing the negative thoughts feelings away. recently though it is like i can not keep it bottled up anymore. i feel ready to explode. i am back in the same place i was a couple of years ago. i have not changed. i have not gotten better. i have just been pretending to feel normal. people do not get me and honestly i do not blame them anymore. i do not even get myself. i truly do not understand why i am this way or why i get so sad and anxious and feel so worthless all the ti ame. i am done trying to figure it out. this is who i am. this is how i feel. i do not even know why i am posting again... i just feel so helpless. the only ti ame i feel normal and happy is literally when i am on a xanax. does anyone else feel this way?	moderate

coronavirus is shutting down my school for weeks starting monday... ...which is good because i do not have to see my crush ex for weeks. i have been trying to let go of her for the past year and a half, but every ti ame i start to feel normal again, she starts talking to me. and every ti ame it gets too serious she just bounces. i want to move on so badly but i just can not for whatever reason. but the coronavirus break has a big downside, i have to sit at home with nothing else to do besides feeling pity for myself and ruining my own ti ame just by my thoughts.	moderate

i had to spend six months doing nothing but studying and it really messed me up i dropped out of university because of my depression and once i wanted to start again we did not have the money so my only chance to go to a good one in my country was to take an exam where they only accept . i spent day and night studying without going out because i do not have any friends. in thirteen days i am told if i get in or not. it was so hard as everyone around me thought i was a lazy misfit because i did not have a job, school, nor friends. honestly the only thing that made me happy was being with my partner. i felt as if i was in house arrest as i also suffer from anxiety and was scared of seeing someone i know if i went out alone. i have no clue how i was able to get thru all of this and i sti will do not know if i got in. also i got accepted into a prestigious school that i can not afford because my father lost everything a year ago. i want to spend my ti ame doing productive things but i just want to sleep all the ti ame.	moderate
it is been a month. one day, i was playing video games when i saw my man boobs and my thighs. i then looked at my phone, which did not have any messages. i was lonely, fat, unsuccessful and an overall failure. i am in high school by the way. so i get up, unlock my bike, fi will air into the tires snd go to the community gym. there, i spend about half an hour sweating and then go home and eat a banana. i eat a healthy dinner and wake up early in the morning. i also start meditating and reduce my masturbation from ti ames a day to once a day. i have been following this for about a month now. i have lost kgs of weight, my brain is now usually silent and i feel more confident in talking to people. yesterday, i started a conversation. i used to have about mins of talk with another human a week, so starting a conversation is huge. it was not easy, but it was very si ample. my conjecture is, that if i keep this up, i would not be needed on this subreddit in another year. if a high schooler can do it, i see no reason you can not.	moderate

yay? i am going to warn that i have not gotten any diagnosis professional help for any of this i have been feeling pretty depressed for a good years at this point, and had gotten pretty good at hiding it. but then lately i have been having anxiety panic attack type things, and i could tell that my mental health was slowly deteriorating from how shitty it was before, but i was sti will trying to lie when people asked if i was okay, smile when i wanted to break down and cry. however, i had an anxiety panic attack today in my th period, but i was able to calm myself down enough and be reasonably stable, so i just went on to my next class band . but then something in me just kinda snapped. the band director told us to do a test play a part of a piece we have by yourself and he had not mentioned this since yesterday, and i tried to ask hi am a question, which should be easy because i am a flute and in the front row, right? right?? fucking wrong. i kept getting spoken over by other people, people were asking me questions, it was so loud, and i just kinda snapped. i started having another panic anxiety attack and was hyperventilating, but then this freaking god that is the first chair flute asked if i was okay and said that i could go to the bathroom and calm down and that she would tell the bd why, thank god for her. so i went into the bathroom for the rest of the class period, sti will fucking dying. and long story short, i went to my last period, feeling awful, sat down and started hyperventilating once more because the room was so damn loud and i had a headache already and people are jerks, the teacher saw me and took me to the councilor, the councilor called my mom, and now i am going to the doctor tomorrow to talk about getting therapy. i am a little spooked to go to therapy, but it seems to have worked for everyone i know for the most part, so yeah.	moderate

i am breaking. please. help bear with me this is a bit of a long story. i am a year old girl from urban georgia who is goes to a fairly prestigious high school. i wouldn t say my life was particularly tough growing up...except the past few years. in the past few years i have had to leave my year long friends and go to a different school, form new friendships, only for them to be broken again when i had to go to another new school because my parents believed it was best. in th grade first year at school number i found out that my mother had developed a drinking problem and had started abusing my father, who never hit her back even though all her abuse. it shook me to my core that someone i trusted so much could si amply turn into a monster...i was and sti will am scared of her. i became withdrawn socially because run my mind why should i trust more random people around me when they wi will either leave me behind or could become like my mother. i fell into a depressive state. i would dig my nails into my wrist to stop myself from crying everyday. every night i was up til midnight or later, listening to my mother yell at my father for thing he had never done, hearing her throw all sorts of shit against the walls, and finding dents in the morning. i lived in constant fear basically, but th grade was when i hit rock bottom. my mother abuse became more physical, she threw a large lamp at hi am, slapped hi am in the face with shaving cream when he was sleeping, threw and broke multiply glasses, and scratched whore into the side of two of our cars...one of which i wi will be driving. she had accused hi am of sleeping with a much much younger co worker she was like and he is in his late forties which she had no evidence nor reason to believe, because whenever i asked her why she thought that she just said he is . she also became a bit abusive towards me, yelling at me for minor things. i became a soulless empty husk all of th grade. i honestly do not remember much since i was a walking mindless zombie. i considered suicide multiply ti ames that year, even thinking about the most painless and quick way to do it. there was a night i was so close to doing it but did not have the guts to leave my old sister and father who i both loved so much, behind. i continued to dig my nail into my arm, i started punching my leg and or banging my head on a wall when i was in a bad state. i also started cutting up my arm with my nails, which were pretty long and once cut my leg up with an exacto knife...i hated everything about myself, i could not look myself in the mirror with out sobbing, i had a supportive friends at dance, but no one at school had any idea. i faked a quiet smile throughout the whole year. i stopped going to lunch and at a snack in the bathroom. i became unable to handle being in crowds or loud noises because of my moms yelling i have also developed a fear of yelling and have to calm myself down . beginning th grade i slowly started to get better, i began talking to and reaching out to a bit more people at school, which was pretty difficult and took many tries to even speak to others. my sister realized what was going on and had been helping me, i got a bit closer with my sister close friends too. i sti will struggled at feeling useless and i hated watching myself dance even though i am at a pre professional level, i forgot to mention earlier but i dance days a week am pm on saturdays and am a soloist in my student company, but i have become a bit more comfortable with my looks. i have remember the first ti ame i genuinely laughed since th grade. i was not close friends with anyone at school but i felt more comfortable commenting on people is posts and texting them to ask questions. i stopped letting people take advantage of me people would ask for me to buy them food and then be like omg you are so my best friend thank you so much!! . i am sti will healing and have many scars. my father snapped and told me mother he wants a divorce, he attitude changed completely once she realized he was serious, because she knew i would want to go with hi am and she cleaned up her act trying to act all nice and buy me things so i would break hi am more than she ever could but i did not and si amply pushed back at her. i am no longer scared of my mother, she is raise me to be intelligent which sucks for her cause i now can fight back with legiti amate facts and reason, i can now stand up for myself and am not afraid to yell at her at the top of my lungs. i would say i am okay. but i am not. my sister is leaving for collage and i am scared since she has been my main support leg. my dance studio is falling apart and all three of my other support legs, my best friends in the world. are ll moving away to pursue dance at a non toxic studio whole different story there . i am getting shaken up again because like i said earlier, i have a bit of a fear of people leaving me behind, and all my support legs are slipped just as i am trying to build new ones. i am so scared of what is going to happen, i am scared of falling back into depression, i want to live but someti ames it does not seem worth it sti will to this day. i am scared please help. everything i have done and fought through feels like it is crumbling and i feel like i am going to retreat back into my shell. i know this was long but i have no other place to turn to and would appreciate some advice.	moderate

parents are truly uncaring they never gave a shit growing up because the idiots had children and lived on government dole... they had too many stresses to give a fuck about the th accidental child. they could never talk about anything deep or educate me on anything because they are uneducated and neither of them speak very good english yet they didnt bother to teach me their language, figuring i would just pick it up after they never interacted with me or conversated with me. they pressured me to become a doctor or engineer when neither of them can even do basic algebra and were unwi willing to facilitate the environment needed to thrive academically. and they fed me like shit and my father actively stopped me from going outside because he thought our neighborhood was too dangerous. so i made no friends outside of school. and being that weird poor kid i made few friends in school as well. now as a year old failure who had some stints in temporary jobs and ulti amately never figured anything out, they do not even pretend to give a shit anymore. they were my only friends and i thought we could solve every problem together but they never wanted to work with me. they shat me out in this fucked world to suffer just like them. they never got the memo of ending the cycle of abuse. i feel utterly betrayed every day that i wake up and every day when i go to sleep. i am fairly certain i am autistic and have been accused of it many ti ames and because i know how hard it is to forge a relationship i place a lot more i amportance on my existing ones. and now my most i amportant relations have shown me ti ame and again that they do not give a shit. i think they do and want to believe they do but they do not. they do not even bother to talk to me anymore, if i try they come up with some shit excuse and leave the convo. they gaslight me on past conversations, they wi will pretend not to have said things that hurt me, even though i know they did. there is no winning. i feel extremely frustrated and angry and betrayed. i see people with parents that do everything they can to give them the best life experience. i feel like i was made to si amply be a slave and now that i couldnt fulfil that role, i am thiscarded. i used to think the joker was stupid but now i find myself si amply breaking into pained laughter at how ridiculous my life has become. i am poor as fuck and realistically i wi will never leave my miserable town. i am a retard, i can not even make money to get out of my parents house. i am stuck in this prison forever. the fact that it was sheer luck that gave me such a terrible starting hand, one that si amply can not be played to win, is just funny. i know not many people wi will read this. but i wanted to get it out there. nobody wi will believe me on anything anymore. they think i am some crazed lunatic that lost it. the truth is i am just incredibly depressed. i dont care about how i look or what i say anymore. i dont care if strangers think i am mad. strangers mean jack shit compared to family and my own family threw me like trash many years ago. i honestly hate this life and i envy every person that has someone to really trust and lean on. this is something i wi will never feel.	moderate

why is life this way? i really do not get it anymore. i mean, i never did anyways. but lately it makes less and less sense. we re being forced into this world, into a system with rules that everybody has to follow. because without these rules it seems, we wouldn t be able to live with other human beings. at least that is what history says. we have to go to school, learn tons of stuff where even teachers say that we would not need it after school. we need to get a job, get a partner, start a family, because that is what society expects us to do. and all of this only because two humans decidet that it would be a great idea to have a child. people die everyday, people who wanted to live, who deserve it. but i, who desperately doesen t want to live anymore, am sti will here. how does that make sense? and i can not ki will myself because then i would be selfish and hurt others. my own suffering is not i amportant, compared to that. please excuse any bad grammar, i am no native english speaker.	moderate

should i get help after a few weeks i finally got myself to write this. i know my back story is by far not as bad as others but i feel like writing this might make me feel better. when i started school i was a very open kid that liked talking to everyone. but because i annoyed them i started to get bullied. they started telling me that i do not have friends and got violent when i started to go against it. back then i had a very good friend that moved away and i lost contact with for years. i started telling myself i did not have friends which only made me feel worse. i was too scared to talk to people thinking they would judge me. this went on until years before my graduation after that it got a lot better i made a good friend and i thought it was going good. after my graduation i started an apprenticeship which is common in germany and was happy. but after a while people at school in germany as an apprentice you have school and go to work started bullying me again. although they did not get violent the started picking on everything that i said even if there was no reason to. they just enjoyed me getting angry or sad. that threw me back into what i was feeling when i got bullied a few years before my graduation. i also heard from my friend i that i mentioned in the beginning who started dealing drugs and destroying his life also my parents prohibited me to have any contact with hi am. my best friend that i made before my graduation got suicidal because of some family issues which made me worry. because of all that to feel better i started playing a lot of video games which did help and i met some nice people. sadly a lot of them are starting to ignore me and i am blaming myself for it. i worry that people think i am weird or annoying and i am scared of losing people i like or people that i just met hating me because of something i do. i often have suicidal thoughts but i am to scared to do it cause i worry people would judge me for it. i also am to scared to tell people how i feel because i fear they wi will tell me that i am fine and i am just lying to myself or seaking for attantion. it took a while for me to finally get myself to tell people about this even if it is just on reddit. i know there are a lot of people who had it way worse than me. but i am tired of always telling people i am fine when they ask or worrying because of the way someone said something to me. can you please give me some advise i do not know what to do. also sorry for my english i am from germany	moderate

.. i can not tell if i am ok and i am not sure what is going on at this point.so basically it started about years ago iv slowly started becoming more detached from every thing and nothing brings me joy anymore things i used to enjoy have just become boring everything is become so boring now and i feel as though there is no point anymore and i feel like i am wasting my ti ame just living.iv noticed it over the past two years but i am slowly loosing the ability to express my emotions i feel no connection to anyone and quite frankly it is gotten to the point where my own family could pass and i wouldn t really think twice as it happens with my grandad he passed away recently and i attended the funeral and i did not feel sad or anything and all these things combined make me feel that my life is complete divoid of anything. i can not feel happy or sad and i can not take interest in anything because it is just so utterly boring not to mention i would rather be alone the only reason i do not is because i maintain a social i amage that society deems us to play my life now is just acting and i want to go to sleep forever and not wake up and iv recently started to notice that everyone in my life is becoming unbearable even my own family. i just wanted to get that of my chest and i can not commit suicide because i really hate pain and there is no painless way to go sadly	moderate
depressed since last year one hour ago my dad callrd me and told me that he gained a lot of weight, almost never goes to work anymore and smokes packs a day. hes depressed and he told me that he has a feeling that he wi will die soon. months ago i dropped out of school and my mom started smoking too. my parents are slowly ki willing themselves because of me. i really dont care about myself, i am and honestly i see no future for me. i really want to ki will myself and dying doesnt sound so scary to me at this point. but i can not do it because if i die, their situation wi will be worse. the day they wi will die, i wi will ki will myself too. their death wi will be my fault and i already feel so much regret. its ki willing me, seeing how much they get hurt because of my choices. i have nobody to talk to because i have no friends now. but i dont care what happens to me, what matters is their happiness, i love them so much i want to make them happy, but i am useless. id take my own life just to see them happy one day	moderate
i am such a loser and i suck at life. lately i just feel so alone. i have not had a real girlfriend since junior year in highschool and i am now . i only have a couple friends and we barely ever hang out. when we do we usually just smoke and play games for a while and then they wi will say they are tired and go home after an hour or two. they probably think i am boring. i wi will suggest we go out on the town and do something exciting or go to the bars or something and they always decline. but then the next day i wi will see on their snap story or social media of them doing the exact thing i suggested. they are starting to thistance themselves from me and soon i wi will be completely alone. even my own parents do not like me. like, they love me and all, but whenever they try to have a conversation with me i feel like they would much rather be talking to my sister, who is better than me in every way. they are so proud of her. she graduated college, is almost done with graduate school, is married, and lives a very busy and interesting life. me on the other hand, dropped out my sophomore year of college, ubers part ti ame, and am pretty much a complete failure, living in my parents basement. i attempted suicide and that is the real reason i dropped out. i had made my amends and had a note and everything. i jumped, and the hook didnt hold and the ceiling broke. i wish i had succeeded. i can not even ki will myself right. so how am i supposed to ever be successful at anything else.	moderate

what are your coping mechanisms? both healthy and unhealthy? i used to starve myself, i do not really have an explanation why, probably really enjoyed this kind of self destruction. and isolating myself from others. also skin picking thing that i hate the most, since it literally ruined my skin condition. hiding from emotions and refusing any kind of help because i used to think that i am fine and everything is alright. working overti ame, spending way too much money. after i started taking my medication, i cook when i am feeling anxious, i enjoy watching cute pets videos. i listen to music, especially sad when i am upset lol, makes no sense but somehow makes me feel better. oh and a lot of depression ending my life because another word is kinda triggering jokes or memes that not depressed people find thisturbing. and i am trying to go for a walk regularly. and stupid tiktok. and i used to like video games. and meditation, sti will have no idea how does it work and usually it annoys me when i fail, same with working out but i am trying my best. what are your ways to deal with this?	moderate

i hate how hard it is to take your own life my mind is made, i have my reasons and i do not want anyone to annoy me with reasons to stay alive that i already heard many ti ames, right now i am just here because i am annoyed at the fact that ending your life is not easy. there society, most people wi will go as far as force you to live for the sake of it just because they do not like the idea of anyone dying if it is a choice on their part. there survival instinct that prevent you from doing many things that could end your life and trying to go against it is extremly hard when it does not just feel straight up i ampossible. there the fact that at least in my case i reject physical pain to the point of it preventing me from doing certain things like cutting my wrist in the bath or to just go for avaliable but especially painfull ways usually go in pair with my survival instinct to make things that much easier . there what you risk by failing if you try wich goes in pair with the lack of avaliable information tools to safely do it wich make it harder just commit to it. there failing in itself that if we forget about the risk of long term damage it make the courage you gathered go to waste and may make the way you tried i ampossible to attempt again for various reasons this way may just not work for you, you may not be able to gather what you need again anyti ame soon if able at all, you may be watched, you may not be able to gather that courage again anyti ame soon, etc... . there how you may not be able to afford take what you need if you can even find it at all. i am pretty sure there even more reasons that i am too tired to think off right now why can not it be as si ample as having an off button? to anyone that wi will basically tell me that it is i amoral to let anyone ki will themself, it is not. what is i amoral is to go against the free wi will of the people by forcing your own way of thinking on them. that said, some people do not really want to die, some just want attention, some have solutions for their problems solutions that must be worth it to the one that want to die , some are too young to make this choice i am thinking the sti will being actively raised by their parents kind of young , some might change their mind if they just wait a bit instead of rushing it as soon as they feel like ending it and there more but the list is long already. it just mean that it is a complex subject and that no, you should not let everyone ki will themself but also that you absolutely should not force everyone to live.	moderate
i just feel empty. i used to feel really depressed, sad, angry etc all the ti ame, but also had moments of joy, energy and freedom. now i just kinda feel empty. it seems like i have forgotten how to feel emotions, passion or anything of the sort. i just exist and do what i am supposed to do and that is it. i am not satisfied with the way i am living but i also dont see any way to change it. i can not afford to get an education, both for money reasons and because taking care of my little one and my family on top of working and keeping the home straight consumes all my ti ame and energy. ive lost touch with what makes me, me. i am directionless and listless most of the ti ame. i dont have any special talents to dig myself out of the hole i am in. i want to make music but ive lost my drive to do anything creative. i barely have any appetite for life or food anymore. it feels like in just withering away. part of me wonders if i should be on medicine again, but last ti ame that did not go well for me. the only thing that really has helped me without any terrible side effects is marijuana, but i dont really have the money to afford a medical card and i dont want to smoke it i willegaly anymore as that could put me in hot water seeing as i have a child. idk. ive been drinking more lately as a way to get to sleep at night with back pain and anxiety but its not healthy and i know it only makes my depression worse the next day. it just feels like a constant rainy day i am my head. i am tired of feeling like this but i dont know what to do. i can not even afford medicine if i did go that route because i dont have medical insurance. i know i need help, i know i can not do it alone but i dont have the means to get help and that is perhaps the most depressing part. i literally can not afford to get the medical care i know i need despite working my ass off more the hours a week, and i makes me feel like there is no silver lining. people talk about being depressed for days, weeks months on end. i can not remember a stretch of ti ame lasting more than a few days when i have not been depressed since elementary school and i am . what can i do?	moderate
why did he do it it is been three years since he committed suicide... why? why did he have to leave me here? to me he was my only real friend i have had in life even though we only worked together for six months. every ti ame i think back at my past, the ti ame i spent with hi am is when i am the happiest. i wish, i just wish i could back just to talk to hi am again. he was the only person who really showed interest in me and felt like he wanted to know me. working with hi am was like not even working at all. i would actually hate finishing up for the day but then get excited for the next. when he told me he was leaving i was shocked and angry so angry i put my walls up and did not talk to hi am at all during his last working week. i did not even say goodbye. what if i was one of the hands that pulled hi am into suicide? i should of told hi am he was my only friend and to keep in touch. that is my biggest regret i wi will have in my life. since then i have worked my way up into his position but i feel so lost and starting to a second guess myself on everything i do. to the point where i actually hate going to work because of it. i wish this was all a dream and when i open my office door he wi will be sitting there with a smile on his face. he was passionate about his work and it rubbed off on me. i feel like the passion is slowly leaving me and i feel like i want to get out of this career path. but the passion comes and goes like waves so i just do not know and feel guilty about wanting to leave. after hearing about what he did i decided to not to give anyone new the ti ame of day and to keep my walls up. because what is the point they could leave me or even worse do what he did. recently i have found someone who i can not stop thinking about. i want to get to know her but she does not seem really interested in talking me. what if she knows i am a horrible person because of what happened? it is starting to break me, what if the feelings i have now is what he felt when working with me for that last week? i am a horrible person.	moderate

mdd and life and college first, here is some basic demographic information, just so we know who i am i am years old. i am from eastern kentucky very southern and attend ed the university of kentucky. finally, i am an atheistic gay guy in a long term relationship that includes years of living together as roommates. now, i want to say that nothing above is really relevant. i have had crippling depression since , am proud of my heritage, and i have a supportive family, i.e. i am treated as a son, not necessarily a gay son or an atheist son we have mutual respect for our differences. what is relevant is that i do not know how i am going to survive life. i am medicated and see a psychiatrist at least monthly. i started treatment fall , when i withdrew from college in order to get medications sorted get back on track. everything seemed to be okay, i did well last semester, and now i have had to withdraw again. i am right back where i was a year ago. i love my program of study and my school. i am confident that it is not the problem. at most the stress exasterbates the problem. that being said, last week i went to a professor for help asking for leniency to get caught up i have a letter of accommodation and my school is thisability resource center allows me to have attendance flexibility due date flexibility . the professor refused. okay, not a big deal, really. the issue is that he closed the door and lectured me for at least half an hour about how everybody goes through problems, about how his nephew failed out of college causing hi am to be depressed, and generally just underminding what a thisability is. i attempted to leave twice because he brought me to tears with the berating, which also caused me to get angry. he kept telling me to sit back down. i am a polite person, so i just did not respond until he lectured out, then i left. he insulted my intelligence several ti ames. to say he has a mightier than thou complex is an understatement, as i am aware and was aware that he is an intelligent individual. there was never a question. however, he knew exactly what my life problems and internal situations were, apparently. he interrupted me when he asked a question. he assumed me to be someone i am not from the ground up, and he wouldn t let me say who i am. apparently, i am a dumb country boy who misses home and forsakes my responsibilities. i am aware i can get hi am into trouble, and etc. however, i do not want to be in a class with somebody like that, so i just dropped the course. i have a full ride scholarship, but i have officially withdrawn from the university and basically i have thrown it away. my gpa is not in the shitter because i have been able to withdraw ti ames now. i could probably go back but it is a bad idea and i know it. the thing is, that is not an uncommon reaction by professors, i have noticed. there are some who are absolutely amazing, and we usually set up a plan at the beginning of the semester, and there is no problem. the rest just want me to email them if anything is up. i do, then they tell me i need an excuse rules say i do not , that they do not approve of the behavior, or outright ignore me. i have never asked for anything grandiose. it is at most extensions. after i got out of the office with that professor, i had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. i sat in my car crying for about an hour, then pulled myself together enough to drive minutes home, then isolated myself and continued wallowing. i am not sure if it was some sort of manic decision or what, but i then decided to completely withdraw, not just his class. i am thinking i am going to take ti ame off again. i am not sure it wi will end any differently, but i have decided to go to school a little closer to home which entails probable loans, moving, and throwing away everything from before. the reason i am choosing the school is purely logical price and programs available. it at most shaves minutes off a hour drive, so i am not sure that my i ampression that it is closer to home is even true, really. my internal dialogue says this is going to end the same way, and that i should just drive off a cliff, or whatever. i just do not know if i can trust my decision because i am at the bottom again, and i know i make awful decisions while depressed. i just let life go and cease caring, which later creates a vicious cycle in which my previous decisions cause me to constantly try fixing everything, which is exhausting and i become depressed, rinse and repeat. is it a manic decision to completely uproot and move? i recently spent close to k in a manic decision, so i have no idea. i feel like my guiding compass is blacked out, somehow. i really do not think school is an issue academically, but the culture may just be wrong for me. i do not know. but i have been someone with major depressive thisorder since , so i know my episodes do not always have a cause or source. it just happens. the best i can usually do is mitigate and stop it from going too far. i am thinking i am probably bipolar, but that is not an issue i want to think about right now. i have an appointment, and i am sure the doctor wi will have an insight. failure used to be my worst fear. this whole thing has made me question whether i am, in fact, an unintelligent country boy who is depressed out of convenience. i logically know that is not the case. the dark spot is just looking for doubts and guilts. i am not sure what i need to do going forward at all. i have no idea where i am at in life. i have no idea how i am going to financially make it thankfully rent is paid through august . energetic me wants to completely reinvent myself and everything around me, fuck the cost. depressed me can not be bothered to care. it is like i am walking into fire intentionally. i just do not care.. at all. about anything, myself included. it is not even an evident sadness at this point. i just do not care about the consequences of everything to the point i am wi willing to just sabotage everything, i think. it is really hard to explain, and school is really only an example, and there are a lot of details being left by the wayside, of course. i am not really sure what i am asking of you, fellow redditors. this is somewhat a vent, and somewhat an open ended question. what do you think, i guess? sorry about the length. my mind is cloudy and thisorganized right now.	moderate

i feel like i have no one... i am on mobile, sorry in advance for formatting . so, i am currently pregnant weeks and these past few months have been hell mentally. i was in a very dark place for quite a while up until around the first part of february i felt little to no connection to the baby growing inside me amp that made me feel like a terrible person. because i was so suicidal, i was being a horrible girlfriend. i just hated myself and wanted to be alone all of the ti ame. in february i decided i needed to get help and try to fix whatever is broken with me. i started therapy amp my therapist and i both agreed it was probably a good idea for me to move back with my dad for a while i had been living with my boyfriend, so obviously this strained our already crumbling relationship . the first little bit was fucking awful relationship wise. but otherwise i had felt like a huge weight was lifted off me. i was starting to wake up and not have the i wish i did not wake up thought every day. i started doing things i used to enjoy again. i thought, for once, that maybe things could get better. my boyfriend and i decided to work on things, so we re sti will together but currently live an hour apart. he is military amp is currently on course, although he is not gone anywhere. just super busy. idk if it is just because i am pregnant and my emotions are so all over the place but i really just feel more alone than ever. i feel like i am really wanting this is work and and trying so hard to make it known that i am putting in the effort and trying to change and work on my flaws amp getting nothing in return.... i know that he is busy with work right now and can not always talk but we barely say more to each other throughout the week than just small talk amp pleasantries and i love you .... i constantly feel like i am being annoying if i msg cause i always feel like he does not want to talk. if i am upset about something, he gets annoyed and it turns into an argument and the past is held against me. it sucks because i am really trying to make it work and not hold the past against hi am amp i do not get the same in return. i have been off work since january because of my pelvis, so on the weeks i do not have my year old i do one week on and one off with his father i feel like i am driving myself insane and the depression is coming back. he is never there to talk amp i do not have a lot of friends to talk to about this stuff so i just sleep a lot my best friend and i are actually no longer friends bc of a situation with my bf that happened in feb i can feel myself going back down the depression hole and idk what to do. i do not feel like i can talk to hi am about things anymore amp i do not want to annoy the one friend i do talk to everyday with the same shit all the ti ame. therapy helps amp i feel good for a day or two after but i keep ending up back here. i do not really know why i am posting this, but if you have actually made it this far thanks for listening to me rant. 	moderate

my mom just called me a failure i have had depression for the last years and i have been suicidal for of them. last night, we got an email from my school talking about the coronavirus and how a kid at another school very close to ours got infected. i jokingly said maybe i should stay home from school just to be safe. she responded with something along the lines of you can not afford to miss school because you are already so dumb i said what do you mean by that to which she replied its like you do not want to meet mine and your father is expectations. like you want to be a failure. i ignored it and went straight to bed. for context, my entire family is very successful and they all went to university and such. i have dyslexia so i struggle with a lot of classes. on top of that i have been bullied all my life which has given me a lack of motivation and wi will. anyways, i cried myself to sleep. i woke up and went to school. i did not go to my classes, instead i bought a few joints off of my friend and sat in a park alone smoking for the entire day. i have not smoked in months but i just did not want to think or anything like that. i came home right now and she was like how was school as if nothing happened last night. she has been very supportive throughout the years for the most part but this has gotten me so worked up. i just want to give up. like if you can not make your parents proud then what is the point of living. sorry for the rant, just needed to get this off my chest	moderate

thanks corona for making my life worse just need a place where i can rant and talk since you all are open arms. do not remember a ti ame where i was not depressed but that is not the post for today. was always doing poor in school college after i lost genuine care and interest for it but things were finally looking better this semester. i got my grades better, talked to my advisor, got back in my classes, everything was good. i even got a girlfriend who i have been with since october who i recently realized i truly love, who influenced me to be better. life was honestly better than bad, and that was felt good. but now coming back from spring break where i worked everyday my school is going online because of the corona virus. it is even effecting my job since i banquet and a lot of people are cancelling events, meaning less hours and less pay. but besides that like i said i am not the best student, but a large part of me being better this semester was the fact that i was on campus and saw everyone doing the same and working hard. even comparing myself to them, it just made me want to be productive and not sit around depressed or thistracting myself. now most of the students went home as in where they truly live and there is no reason to be on campus. i used to be on campus all day from to pm because i did not want to come home, now there is no excuse and i am stuck where depression is over my shoulder with roommates i want nothing with. i know i do not have the motivation to do it because i never have, and am literally afraid of checking emails. my girlfriend also left today so we kinda broke up which is nice. not because of anything bad, like i said things were great with us, but the thistance issue is real and i got to see how she feels on long thistance, even though i am not for it. guessing we re in the middle stages rn but i already cried so what is the point. if school did not end she could have gotten a summer job and stayed with me, but now she leaves near two months early which means two months longer and idk what is our relationship now. that is on top of the already constant stress, anxiety, depression from other issues and i tell em all i am okay i am not okay i have not been for i do not know how long now. why feel happiness and i amprovement if everything is just going to fall apart in the end	moderate
i think broken people are wiser. first off, let me just say i am not glorifying depression in any way. it is a serious mental i willness that so many people face. i wouldn t wish this on my worst enemy as it is one of the toughest battles i have ever had to face in my life. that being said, it just occurred to me as i was walking in the rain, coffee in hand and passing people with their groups of friends i know, sounds so tumblr . they were laughing about something and i just could not get how someone could always be happy. this group that i saw was always happy like always we live on the same floor . that was when i remembered the term ignorance is bliss, and the meaning that has on our life. and for the record i am not saying that happy people live in delusional little worlds and are ignorant in a dumb or arrogant sense. they are not. everyone has been through hardships and insecurities. but i think the wiser are the people who have gone through stuff in their life and have the ability are doomed to feel the highest sense of emotion in the worst possible way. they are able to think deeper and see bigger pictures. and that means that majority of the wiser are fi willed with broken people. i do not think i am smart or a genius in any way seriously my grades definitely back me up there , but i pride myself on my memory and my observance. i just kept thinking would i trade all of this thinking for a genuine smile? would i swap depression for ignorance? my answer is yes. i would rather be blissful and happy than suffer like this. sorry if this makes no sense, i am tired and downing coffee despite it only being in the evening. but it is raining and gloomy and my mind is wandering. now that i read this it honestly does not make much sense to me. i guess it is a way of venting or even making myself feel the slightest bit better. i am a lonely, broken spirit in the least beautiful way.	moderate
how do i want to motivate myself and want to get better when literally everything around me is falling apart? everyone keeps telling me i can not rely on medication, counselling etc and that i need to start trying to help myself. everyti ame i do try it just seems to get thrown back in my face and honestly i am sick of it. i do not want to let depression beat me but it is gotten to the point now where i do not even want to try and get better, i just want to hide and wallow in my own self pity.	moderate
things get better, but not really. i feel like now i do not deserve to call myself depressed, because when my mental health get better, from just being a masochistic and always tired being sounds easy, but i just do not like these ti ames, do not want to say much i focused on my appearance, which you probably might take as a joke, but this aspect excluding the fact that my mother is jobless and shes overusing alcohol, doesnt care about us me and my siblings, is so close minded that you can not talk with her so we have no relation but she is talking and screaming for the whole ti ame so i can not study and i wish i could have normal mother ... this aspect makes me feel so worthless. jesus christ what the fuck. i would like to say more but what if yall not going to take it seriously? it hurts, i am crying while writing this and feel so.. fucking.. bad and clueless. i did not care earlier about this and now it is like the main problem in my head. l m a o at me. i am from poland and if someone who d like to talk maybe probably noone is from pl too we can talk in polish.	moderate
struggling to see the light i keep telling myself that i am working toward something that wi will make everything better. a new sense of purpose and security. every step along the way has been painful. i get thiscouraged and want to give up at any sign of difficulty. but i can not quit again because that is exactly why i have nothing to show for myself in my late s. how do some people just choose something that they want to do with their lives and achieve it? i guess i am sti will relatively young but i have wasted an entire decade with my mental i willness and self sabotage. i feel like it is too late for me and i missed my shot at happiness. where is the reset button? not feeling suicidal but i can not wait to die and just be done with all of it.	moderate

coronavirus is about to ruin my life. hey guys, so this damn coronavirus thing is about to ruin my life. i live in fear from november to about now usually because i have severe emetophobia fear of throwing up because i am afraid of getting sick. now i am not afraid of getting the coronavirus honestly, what is upsetting me is how life is coming to a stand sti will here now and things are getting difficult. toilet paper, hand soap, water, and other basic supplies are getting harder and harder to find on a daily basis. i also have ibs so i go through toilet paper faster than most people do. the weather is finally getting warmer, and i was so excited to be out of the hell that is worrying all day and night, but now i have this to worry about too. every day i come on here and see how more people are being infected and dying and it is upsetting. i feel like this is the end of the world as we know it and there is nothing anyone can do about it. it is just another shitty unstoppable force that is out to ruin everything for everyone. my grandpa is at great risk with this as he is been in a coma pretty much for over a year now due to a burst aneurysm, so seeing articles on here on the front page of someone you know wi will most likely die from this is not helping at all. i know were all in the same boat with this virus as everything is shutting down everywhere, but i am pissed off. there was so much i was looking forward to this spring and summer that just got ruined entirely.	moderate

complainer? rant and questions i was called a complainer by a very close friend and damn, it hurts. do not think it is fair. the criticism went around the fact that me complaining too much just makes the problems worse. it sounds as if i would get better from depression if i suffered in silence. that is definitely not the case. i totally get not wanting to be around me because i only have negative things to say, or not wanting to talk about certain topics. but that is upon you, you should just say i do not like listening to you complain , not making it a personal fault of mine. i feel momentarily better for getting things off my chest and i have a friend or two who i can count on for that. not speaking or not having someone to talk to makes me feel more lonely. he is buddhist, his rationale went like this complaining is bad on the long term. not complaining gives your better relief on the long term because complaining is fighting against the world while you should be making peace with it. when you do make peace, you can apply the energy you spend on fighting on looking for solutions. when you make peace with it, you do not have to complain about it, which makes a virtuous cycle. that rings true to some extent, although the rest of what he told me just sounds very thismissive of my problems. i was saying how this buddhist monk said that, when we re tired, we should make peace with it and do nothing so we can reenergize ourselves, but i never manage to reenergize myself. he said that i am always complaining instead of reenergizing myself and i said that i can not just do nothing until i am well rested i have a job and a side job, i am not keeping up but have to pay the bi wills . he answered complaining complaining complaining lol . people most of the ti ame do not understand that when you re depressed, you have an invisible problem always with you. you can get into an argument with someone and then forget about it, but you can not forget you re tired and sad all the fucking ti ame. it does not go away, that is why the complaints are repetitive. nobody asks a person in pain to stop wailing and concentrate on getting better. this friend in particular was never much interested in asking about my day or my problems, now i know i annoy hi am and i wi will continue our unbalanced friendship without ever talking about or hinting at what is going in my life again let us just concentrate on yours, darling. now i have one more thing to police myself about. so, are you a complainer? have you been justly or unjustly called that? how do you deal with negativity, having a bad life and having a lot to complain about and having friends at the same ti ame? what you think about how complaining affects your mental health? i just do not talk much about my life with people i am not close to, or else it might get sad and awkward really fast. i mostly do not tell much of what is going on to friends except if they ask, and even then mostly in abridged version. there are a select few to whom i tell everything. since i restricted my social circle a lot and keep it to myself, i do not have to deal much with controlling negativity around people. when i do make friends, i focus the talking on them and try to be as nice and useful as i can without asking for emotional support or sharing much about me.	moderate

is there a point of no return? lastly i have been thinking there may be a point of no return to all this shit, where i do not even deserve to get better. i am back in college now, but i have lost two years of my pri ame, being a leech to my parents. i have paid for prostitutes, never had a girlfriend as an adult, wich is only i amportant because it is a symptom of how little do i give a fuck about people and i amproving as a man, and i do not really have friends. and the thing is, i do not even feel that bad someti ames, i am just really mad with everyone and everything including myself. i can get out of bed, but i can not connect with others, and i have this really strong feeling that i should really ki will myself or find a way to start from scratch. i feel like i am just becoming a worst person every day, and it is mostly my fault. i am not a victi am of anyone, i put myself into this. i just do not know, is it really worth it to come back? what does a mediocre person have to do in this world to deserve to live? i do not even have anything to offer. i just really want to blow my brains out. i can not talk about this with anybody without feeling i am asking for attention. and this is another call for attention, but as strangers, what do you guys think? is there a point where it is not worth it to come back?	moderate

on being okay with not being okay and going through it alone i think this is an i amportant step to take when trying to heal from depression. accepting your reality and your emotions and not needing to hold on to every little thing that might make your day the tiniest bit more bearable or positive. it is okay if your friend is too busy to talk, it is okay if you run out of your drug of choice. it is okay that the only di am flicker of light in the darkness, the only thing that made you crack a smile, is not there anymore. do not feel bad for going through it alone. this is someti ames necessary. all i hear all over social media is that you re not alone, you re loved, you re wanted. what if this is not the case? do not feel sorry for yourself if this is not the case. you need to be okay with not being okay by yourself. because every day you go through it alone, you re giving yourself the chance to be your own support system. forgive yourself. as long as you re alive, you objectively have a chance to heal. take that chance. sure, reach out for help but also, attempt to help yourself when others can not be there. you do not know if you can do it alone. you might not be able to. but you re the only one that has full responsibility over that. everyone is living their own life, worrying pri amarily about themselves and the ones that do not, are sacrificing themselves to do that. which is okay for parents but not always otherwise and should not be encouraged. you need a degree of selfishness to maintain your mental health. i hope this does not come across as encouraging people not to get help. i just have to point out that not everyone has the means to reach out to people and to be loved by others. no one should derive their self worth from that. you have to love yourself and that takes a shit load of suffering to do correctly. but in the end, it is always worth it. because the freedom you feel from truly loving yourself and not needing someone to love you or give you attention, is incomparable to anything else. it is never too late to achieve that.	moderate

does not matter honestly, i would not mind if nobody reads this. i would not get my dopamine points, but sti will i feel like i want to rant now, so bear with me. the world is cruel, no one cares about anyone anymore. i am just tired of hearing things like you matter , i care , get help, they wi will care . no they would not, in this world everyone cares about themselves, wi will mr president care about some nobody? wi will your doctor? wi will it be your teacher? what about your family? everyone cares for a short ti ame, after that you ll be just some dust in their eye, that is all. how can a piece of matter be relevant? people create their idols, they do not care about a dying person on the sidewalk but they do if their favourite actress trips and destroys their dress. and does these idols, after reaching everything in life, feel happy? no, so does a person like me who does not have a sliver of hope in life even deserve it? after reading so many entries like this how can you sti will lie that you care?? no one cares if i smoke, no one cares if i drink so much that i hit my head against the wall. no one cares if i cut myself in my bathroom so that there is blood everywhere. no one cares if i live, or if you live. life just sucks, i would not be mad at you, just at myself...for wasting your ti ame on this piece of replaceble worthless scum.	moderate
my note saw someone post their note here, wanted to put my thoughts down in a place where no one i know can find them. ive always felt some kind of guilt when i said i was depressed, because i guess i didnt really have it that bad in life. i hear about all of these poor teenagers that were born into abusive families and such, and ive always just felt like i was being an overdramatic ass or something for how ive been feeling for the past few years, i havent really gone through that much obvious hardship i guess. i am years old and ive never dreamt of anything. ive never had real ambitions or thought about what my future could hold. i keep getting told that i am a bright kid and i have a great future ahead of me but in the back of my head i knew i was going to end up doing what i am doing now. when i was , i started feeling suicidal. bit by bit i fell deeper into the pit, feeling more hopeless with each passing year. i would make new friends and feel like i was feeling better, then in a matter of weeks id ruin it and push them away. it is gotten to a point where i feel like i am a burden no matter where i go or who i am with. i have very few friends left, and it doesnt feel like they actually care about me, feels more like they pity me. idk how to explain it but i dont actually want to die. theres actually a part of me that wants to cling to whatever i have left, and start trying at life again. i am scared of dying, but i just want to give up. ive given up on school almost completely, ive given up on trying to be sociable, ive given up on trying to find reasons to live for. i feel selfish doing this, but i dont see the point in trying anymore. i dont see a point in pathetically clinging to life at this point i guess. i want to take the easy way out, feels like i am meant to do this. no one really suspects i am suicidal or depressed, ive kept it as private as i could for as long as i could. ive always thought about whether or not people would genuinely care if i went away. i know i would get a few tears and whi ampers, but in a couple years ti ame id just be a story anyway. doesnt seem like theres much sense in sticking around just to feel numb every day. i love you all, and i genuinely hope you do not meet the same fate as me.	moderate

managed to overcome a decade of clinical depression, annd now it is back. i am in desperate need of help advice. i am female. i was severely depressed for years, and managed to overcome it during the past four years. it is now coming back with a vengeance. background my dad is and has always been verbally and physically abusive. my mom lives with hi am and enables his behavior because she has no choice, he is the one who makes money. he has never had any close friends since i have been alive. if someone ever came to the house when i was growing up, he would run and hide to avoid. he sti will does this, even if it is the pizza delivery guy coming to the door. at work, he is very quiet and everyone there thinks he is just mild mannered polite guy. as soon as he gets home, he is a different person. because of this, i have no witnesses that could see his behavior. i have always suspected he has something like borderline personality thisorder. my family would never admit to something like this as they live in denial about everything. currently last week, i was in a pinch and had to borrow a couple hundred dollars. this is not something that happens regularly, or ever at all. it made me sick to ask and i felt terrible, but let me be clear he has plenty of money and this is not hurting hi am by any means. asking made me humiliated and he made sure to let me know how bad i should feel. since i have not been able to pay it back yet, he called me yesterday screaming and throwing a fit and sent me a bunch of horrible messages about how awful i am. this is nothing new as he has always been known to have complete freak outs over little issues and blow everything out of proportion. i have some serious bi wills piling up and can not make the payments plus the rent i need for this month. i am working full ti ame but everything is just too much. i am overwhelmed and can not i amagine feeling more sad. i desperately want to take out a loan but i have not established my credit for long enough. the only thing i can do is go stay with them. i am so scared of having to go stay with hi am and have my dog and myself get abused. the last ti ame we visited, my puppy gets very excited to see people, and he had a meltdown from the dog resting his chin next to hi am on the couch. he started hitting my freaking puppy over it!! over just wanting attention to be petted. it was horrifying. it is so hard to explain his personality because everything is like, how could you do that? he has serious rage issues that he is never been able to control and he flips out over tiny things. then afterwards, he would act like nothing happened. it is coming down to my only option of having to stay with hi am and i have been up for days crying about it. for anyone who is lived with mental physical abusers, you know that just being around these people deteriorates your mental health and causes permanent damage. if i did not have my dog, i would seriously be considering suicide. after a lifeti ame of dealing with this, i can barely take it anymore. if anyone has any advice for alternative resources, i would appreciate it more than you could ever know.	moderate

what do you guys think of this? i am seeing this chain being posted around. ironically usually by people who seem rather happy and likely oblivious to things in the realm of suicide. whats the take? gt suicide is highly preventable and you do not want to lose anyone close and feel like you could have helped prevent it. suicide is forever you wi will never be able to get them back. in australia, on average we lose lives every day to suicide and unfortunately for us males, we are three ti ames more likely to end our lives. everyone of these tragic losses are preventable. all too often, some men find it easier to criticize each other or themselves instead of building each other up, with all the negativity going around, lets do something positive!! upload picture of yourself then tag or more men to do the same. build yourself up instead of tearing yourself down copy and paste if i tagged you, do not thisappoint me, you better do it!!! let us spread some positivity! checkuponyamates	moderate

my mom is an incedibly great person but i can not come over some things she did and i am having a mental break down rn i wi will never be able to think about london without crying. it was a present for my th birthday to go there. my mom saved money for years casually and slow but it was sti will a lot of ti ame . about a week or so before we were supposed to leave i started having a bad episode again. a really bad one. as close as we got to depature day it got worse since i paniced that i would be this depressive the whole ti ame we are in london. i really tried but it really just got worse. i wasnt really down to anything but my mom made this whole efford. she booked some kind of harry potter tour even if she knew she doesnt have the endurance and the bones to walk that fast for so long through the streets. i felt the tense in the air. there was one thing i was exited about and it was a musical. i am a sucker for musicals but i am also very bad at letting emotions out especially around my mom. so on the way there she was all like arent you exited?! this wi will be great. yada yada yada. and i smiled and nodded but it didnt felt right and was weird. but we got there. i was like a stone in london. i was unable to truly laugh even if i wanted to. even while the play. then after it i couldnt really let it sit. normally even in movies i would wait for the credits since by then everyone is gone and you can just kind of sit there and let everything settle. i wasnt able to do that and then it was quiet again on the ride home even if my mom put a lot of work into keeping the mood up. i appreciate that but like i said. it was a really bad episode and i couldnt really cope with my feeling so i rather did nothing. on another day we were in some train going somewhere and then my mom snapped. what is wrong?! i didnt wanted to talk but i also hated to lie so out of my mouth came this tiny little brush of like its okay. but of course my mom was on it now. that is just understandable. no its not. you are acting weird this whole ti ame. whats going on?! dont you want to be here. at this point i felt incredibly guilty because i knew what mom did to make all this happen and i just wasnt really there. i then had to cry. i said nothing since i actually didnt wanted to be there but at the same ti ame i wanted. i just didnt wanted to be there at this moment. you know i did all this for you and i put work in it and you dont like it. just at least say it! do you want to go home?! i cried so badly at this moment. i felt so bad. i liked everything she had done. it was amazing. its just my brain that kept me from idk. everything. we then booked some earlier flights home. i payed the half. my mom told everyone we went home earlier since my grandma was in hospital. to this day i wi will be forever sorry that it seemed like i wouldnt appreciate what my mom did but there is just this tiny little bug in the back of my head that is questioning my moms thinking. your daughter having a mental break down out of nothing? why wouldnt she want to be in her dream city? she is like... saying absolutely nothing all those days. wouldnt you get suspicious as a parent? i hate when people blame other people for not noticing their depression as if they could change something. but just a little bit more asking? idk. there were other stories that make especially this weird but this post is already too long and i can not see through my tears. i really can not think about it without crying.	moderate

why i can not hold a conversation? i am incapable of sustaining normal conversations, specially on chats. i just fucking can not, and i end up boring the other pe son always. the only person i can hold a conversation with, is one friend, and he is the only one. we do not really talk, we just make a series of never ending jokes and laugh all day. that is not a conversation, it is? the problem, and what haunts me the most, is that it is not like that all the ti ame. few weeks ago i met a girl she texted me for some reason , and we talked for like hours just that day. the next day like hours, and well, generally we talked a lot. i felt very good about that, because i finally felt like i was interesting to someone. a month later, we have not had a real conversation about normal stuff in weeks. our longest conversations now are about his parents, who apparently, are total dicks. each ti ame i try to talk to her like we did when we met, something happens, and our conversations like that are not interesting, i feel like i am boring. she probably just got bored of me, i mean, pretty much everyone does. i guess i am not interesting enough, which is sad, because the conversations we had, made me think i am not a lost cause at all, that i can eventually talk to others, you know, hold conversations. now i see that i do not really can, and that is making me sad, very sad. maybe i should just give up already and stop this suffering. is it me? i mean, is it just my brain? i am being paranoid? how can i know? is this temporal? if i go to therapy and take antidepressants, wi will i become capable of talking to others eventually? i am doomed to be this guy forever? you know, maybe i should stop believing something is going to change, because all my life, i have been the constant to all my problems. i am the fucking constant, it is me, it is fucking me. i should give up. death is better than feeling shitty all the ti ame. this is not a fucking life, this is suffering, and that is not going to change, because i am broken, i am a failed human being, that is zero interesting and zero social. i want to die.	moderate

i really do not know what to do. i feel empty. i am feeling like i am bothering my friends when i tell them about my suffering. they do not deserve this, they deserve more than me, more than shitty friend as i am. i should not have friends. i am not worthy to have friends or to be loved. i do not know who i am anymore. i do not want to feel anything. nothing that i am feeling is positive. i do not want to be here anymore. i do not know what to do with my life. maybe looking to the stars and waiting for death. i do not want to pretend that i am okay, when i am not. i would give my life to my dead grandpa, he deserves it more than me. i hate myself. i hate everything about me, my look, my voice, my thoughts... i hate that i am pretending to be someone else, even when i do not have a clue who i am. it ki wills me to pretend to be heterosexual, when i am not. i hate that i am doing it for my family, for my mom, because they did not accept that i am bisexual. i hate that i sti will care about them even they hurt me. i hate that i did not tell this to my dad parents are divorced ... but his reaction would be worse than moms. i hate myself for all of these things and more. i really hate myself for not knowing what to do. i want to die. death would be the best option for me.	moderate
school shut down i dont think people realize how i amportant it is for my school to not be shut down from the corona virus. going to school is my only social interaction with people anymore whether they hate me or not. staying home for weeks sounds awesome to a normal person but that is hell for me. i hate my sister and my mother whom i live with and tolerate my stepdad. i am either always yelling, getting yelled at, crying, or stuffing my sorrow with food and school is my freedom from that even though i do the same things? i guess at home it is worse and at school i am able to talk back and defend myself from people is shit while at home i have to take it or i will get kicked out. some poeple might also think how i shouldnt be bored or i am ungrateful for all my technology, but the truth is i didnt want any of it but ik grateful for it. i go home and i lay in bed rather then my pc, xbox, or oculus because ik just so bored of life itself. if my school gets shut down or cancelled whatever the fuck then my depression wi will skyrocket, wi will to live plummet, and over all be a bi willion ti ames more bored then i already am.	moderate
i am really starting to snowball fail. my mother is sick, shes mentally went, crazy, abusive, and can barely put on her shirt let alone help me with school and college. she used to be quick, sharp and cunning but dementia has really taken a toll on her. my father is bullshit, an asshole, and fake as fuck. he ruined my mother, he was the love of her life and she was broken down when he turned out to be a liar. he is sti will leaching off her house and money, would not help me at all, etc. both of my parents argued by entire life, i always believed i was the thing that made them stop kissing, having sex, showing affection. i have never seen them hug or kiss. never hold hands. i have not even been out to eat with them. they only argued and complained about the news. they both sheltered me, never let me leave the house. they sti will would not let me learn how to drive, get a job or leave the house. and since i am only , i can not combat anything legally. i have no money, i failed my high school years i was generally stressed going to my previous school but managing to get bs, c is and d is with the occasional a in honors courses. until a teacher fucked up my math grade and made me so stressed out i started pulling my hair. so i left that school and went to a regular hs in the middle of the rd quarter big mistake . the teacher got fired weeks after i left. then someone crashed into my mother is mid life crisis car and she stopped driving, she lost her mind. blah blah blah present day. i am doing online school because i thought to go to hs and dealing with fake people all day was the problem. that drains me but now i sleep all day, wake up, read a book, listen to music in the dark, play my crossword and then go back to sleep. been doing that for and a half months and i sti will feel the same. i am smart i swear lmao, my iq used to be when i was happy as a child now it is ish. i just do not know what to do with myself. i am in li ambo and i can not leave. i was thinking about getting my ged but idk how i wi will get a scholarship or any aid with a . w gpa . uw and a psat. i just fucking suck right now, my parents always said if i do not graduate college and hs i am going to fail at life. that is what feels like is happening.	moderate
 social thistancing is probably going to make a lot of people is depression worse i have already had a few events cancel. the awful irony is that i am currently in a pretty bad place mentally these past weeks, definitely a low point after a while. and my social life sucks, me trying to address it with what little energy i have, meanwhile current epidemic conditions are making that harder i cut back on working from home too because i think that contributes to my isolation and my depression so, yay? it sucks knowing how literally all i have to do to see my goals through is do the work. instead? i get tired and do not, barely keeping up on things, which contributes to me feeling behind and like my goals are eternally far away. all of these factors adding up is not great oh and today my anxiety was absolutely awful and i spent most of the day unable to work because of it. i did hit the gym hard though... and went outside, of course going outside just made me feel more alone, as i see other people	moderate
am i overreacting or did my therapy intaker cross lines? i finally decided to try therapy again and the way this clinic worked was they have me do an intake interview with someone then assign me a social worker. so i did the intake a month ago and i am very happy with the social worker i was assigned. however, i am sti will thinking about the things that were said to me during the intake during which i felt very judged. i do not know if i am just overreacting. some examples, i mentioned that i dropped out of high school when i was and he said to me in a very judging tone you dropped out during senior year??? i explained that junior year was about to end for me when i turned except i was failing every class because i had been skipping school basically everyday, which means i probably have to repeat junior year, which means more years of high school so dropping out and getting a ged seemed like a better choice at the moment. then he asked me if i am going to college working, i said i was recently out of work and i applied to cc which starts in the fall, so nothing at the moment as i am living with my parents and he said and your parents are okay with you not doing anything?? i mean i do not really know how to answer that other than yeah. later on he asked me if i was in regular education in high school. i was confused so i asked hi am what he meant. he asked if i was in regular education or special education. i feel like at that point he was just doing it on purpose to mock me. overall the session made me feel like shit and sti will keeps me up at night. however, i know someti ames i overreact to things and i want to know your perspective on this.	moderate

two of my best friends that i thought were helping me with my depression just abandoned me and i do not know why... two of my best friends have stopped talking to me for the last weeks, and i really do not know why. they were helping me feel better by just being my friends and being caring towards me. now they have stopped talking to me entirely and try to avoid me at all costs. i see them literally every day since we are on a team together, and since they hate me now all of the sudden for no reason, it is absolute torture every day. it seems like every person i get close to pushes me away or abandons me at some point. i really do not know why and i do not know what is wrong with me, but i have tried to get help and every ti ame it seems like it makes it worse...	moderate

recently had a major fight with my mom, do not know how i wi will manage pretty long i am so fucking useless and wished i was dead right now with all the coronavirus stories, my university decided to close down most of it is services and just do remote teaching for all of my classes. today, my mom and i got into a huge fight over financial issues with me, and i just got so upset that i wanted to stay on campus at the university i live at. this was just one of a series of things that decided to force me to stay on campus and fi will out the paperwork to do so which i just got accepted for and wi will do until it all finished up, which my university says is temptingly for april . i am done, every winter summer break i come back and it feels like i am fucking dead inside, and i actively want to self harm while there. the only reason i do not do it is because i know she wi will call the police and get me hospitalized. she just fucking ruins me and makes me feel incredibly numb and frustrated. i actively anticipate going back to school because then i at least know i wi will be hours away from her and i would not get as much of her. i am far from a good person myself, i am always looking for something or someone to blame. i am bad with money. i do not reach out and talk to people as often as i should, or want to, and then wonder why people would not do the same with me. i get angered and offended relatively easily. i am too dependent on other people, financially and emotionally. although the latter i have gotten better at than i was in the past, but i digress . so, like, i get why my mom wouldn t like me. at the end of the day, though, she wants me back home because she is afraid for my health which is bullshit with all this coronavirus stuff. but i would actually rather die from this god forsaken i willness than get to hear her constantly berate me, say that i am exactly like my abusive dad, not listen to my own concerns about how i feel about her and why she treats me the way she does, and wi will not listen to me about my own mental health, as well as making me feel as if i should not openly express it to other people. i am an awful person, but she is the fucking pits and i am sick to death of people defending her as being of a different ti ame bullshit, i know her well enough to know that she wi will only ever be open and accepting to new ideas and opinions if they are in her favor or just being raised that way which i can see more of, given that she was not born into a whole lot of wealth and was not really taken after by her own parents, only her grandmother who passed away when she was young . i do not give a flying fuck about her trials and tribulations at this point she may have it bad, but she actively inflicts it onto me and my sisters with no reason or excuse. she is not the only reason, but she sti will is a large part of my depression and suicidal thoughts within the past few years. now, i am staying on campus for nearly a month and i do not want to deal with her. i have a job opening for me, but in order to get enrolled i need a social security card or a passport both of which my mom have, and i know now she would not give it to me, so i am fucked . in general, i am just fucked broke only dollars in the bank, nowhere to go to , no job, and uncertain about everything, and i want to lay down and not breathe anymore. this, combined with everything else going on outside, is putting me into full on doomer mode. fuck this.	moderate

i do not expect advice, i just needed to vent and i do not care who sees it. i am only years old, coming up on , and i have had depression ever since i was . i have always kept it hidden and refused to show it to other people, even my family. i was scrawny, practically a walking stick back in th grade and i was made fun of a lot, the girl i had a crush even said ew to my face when she turned and saw me. this brought my self confidence down a shit ton so i started working out for years. i was feeling good about myself for a good awhile but the depression never left, i kept wondering if my friends even saw me as a friend or if i was a loser but no one would say anything cause they get bad. so i resorted to playing video games, it became a hobby and then an escape. playing video games thistracted me from my outside problems. did not think about life, school, nothing. i was invested in it but now my parents constantly tell me i play too much and when i get off when they tell me and start studying i get the overwhelming feeling that i am a failure in their eyes because i sit around and play games and that thistracts me from school work and i do not get anything done. my grades suffer, my parents get mad, my depression gets worse, and i play even more. i was always told to man up and do not be a pussy so i did not tell anyone and all i can do is cry at night when no one can hear me. a therapist sounds like the best option along with telling my family but i have gotten so accustomed to not telling anyone it hurts to even think about telling anyone. i do not want to go in anymore detail, this is pretty much the just of my situation. short version i used to be a stick and was made fun of so i started working out. i felt good about myself but always question reality. i resorted to gaming as a hobby but then as an escape from my problems. my parents are fed up with me gaming so much that i see myself as a failure and cry myself to sleep here and there. my grades plummet, my depression gets worse, and my parents are more thisappointed. i can not tell people cause i am told to man up so i am just accustomed to it.	moderate

abusive relationship between parents and kids my dad has been verbally abusive my whole life. i feel like he is never said any good things to me. he used to tell how i ugly i was or boring, compare to my brother and sister, make jokes about my small boobs, think of me as a liar and an addict. he made me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed of myself countless ti ames. i kept in touch with hi am because i thought it was i amportant to support your family and accept them. after our last conversation i made a decision to stop talking to my dad. he called right before my class started and screamed at me. he did not ask any questions about my life or college as usual. he just screamed. when i told hi am to call back after my class he said go fucking study . this finally opened my eyes. my dad neither loved me nor cared about me. i never called hi am back and not going to. now it is been a week. i feel relieved like never. to everyone who feels abused please get rid of such people if you can. it is not worth it.	moderate
my mom is destroying our relationship some context i am a year old male with a twin sister and a mother and father who live together at home. i am a sophomore in college, and have recently had to come home and be reminded of the incredible toxicity my mother exhibits almost every single day. here is what she does . she take on stressors which are not hers to bear, regardless of what the original bearers wished for or needed. . she gets stressed, and because she seems to have zero capacity for emotional control, she i ammediately become i will, rude, mean spirited, spiteful, i ammature, aggressive, hostile, selfish, and reckless with other people is feelings and emotions. . if ever challenged about this behavior, she always justifies it with, well, i am stressed and anxious and sorry for carrying about you followed by a dramatic spike in the previously mentioned shitty treatment of others, and zero self reflection. . life presents some mindless thistraction, and she gets over it. that is until the next ti ame something mildly inconvenient happens no scratch that something mildly inconvenient happens to someone else in the family . that person is suffering is only exacerbated when the person suffering now not only do, they have to deal with the issue, but they also have to deal with the entirely separate issue of all that negative energy that my mom creates. she then of course inevitably becomes the center of attention in regard to that initial issue, as well. i should add that all those ugly reactions can also be manifested if it is her own problems she is dealing with. i could almost forgive that but her usage of other people is problems just seems manipulative and abusive. she is pushing sixty and has been doing this my whole life.	moderate

what is wrong with me? i do not know where else to ask this. i guess i wi will preface with that i have never actually been diagnosed with depression and i have never gone out of my way to seek any help. i am also not suicidal, nor would i ever think of doing that. i just need some answers. i live a pretty regular life. i have a decent paying job. i rent a house. i have a girlfriend. i have a car. i can afford to buy things when i want them... i just can not seem to be happy much anymore. i actually hate my job that i have been doing for almost years now. i love the people, but i have shitty hours, and management does not seem to actually care for their employees. i have tried job searching but i always come up short or just dealing with what i have got now. i go to work in a bad mood, and i come home from work just wanting to do nothing. i want so bad to just do my hobby and play some video games, but i do not like doing that much anymore. i just want to do nothing. i want to go and get in shape, too, but i can not get in the right mindset. my girlfriend and i have been together for almost years now. things started out great, but they have gone downhi will from there. we may live together, but we re polar opposites. she believes in god, i do not. i have hobbies and friends we ll touch on the friends later , and she does not. we see things way differently, and she is nearly cheated on me multiple ti ames but i have always been faithful and forgiveness always has its way. i want out, but i can not muster up the courage to get out of this. my friends are something else. i actually have a lot of good friends who i can rely on. i love them to death. i do not know where i would be without them. i have also lost touch or just lost multiple great friends. i lived with my best friend for years before he got engaged. i was so happy for hi am. i was invited to be a groomsman for his wedding and i was so happy for hi am and his new wife. they also kicked me out of the house on short notice. like i had less than a week to find a new place and ended up moving back in with my parents. after the wedding, i have not talked to hi am. i have tried, but he just seems to have left my life. it really sucks. i do not know what i did wrong or if i did something wrong. it hurt really bad, and sti will does. some might say i have had it rough. i have had grandparents that i got really close to. out of are dead and one just had a stroke and that is been hard to deal with. my favorite uncle biological mom is side committed suicide a few years back. my biological mom did the same thing a year after. her and i had not spoken since she left when i was or . she sent me a facebook message the week she ki willed herself saying i was always her favorite and that she loved me. i did not respond. she was already gone to me... but when i found out that she had ki willed herself, i could not help but feel guilty that maybe i could have said something and maybe she would sti will have a life. i might have hated her, but i did not wish death upon her. now that you have a little background i guess i just want to end this saying i just want to be happy again. i want my life back. i want to do better for myself. i just do not know how. i want to escape this feeling of nothingness. i want to be again. i want to be happy.	moderate

i feel like i am living a nightmare about three weeks ago i attempted suicide. i was not successful, as you could probably tell, and i ended up in a hospital. there are so many emotions that i feel, and when i try to explain them all i become so overwhelmed. i can not explain most but i can say that i feel like i can not wake up. i am trapped inside a nightmare. as soon as i wake up in the morning i am overcome with dread, shit, i am sti will here. it is hard to sleep and when i wake up i want to sleep again. my mind and body are so tired, i can not do anything. i feel helpless and hopeless. i am trying to snap out of it. i am trying meditation and medications, but nothing is working. when i am so deep into this state it is god awful. i realise that no one is here. no one is with me when i am in my worst moment. people leave me in my worst, and no one is left. i want to be understood, but i am everything they do not want. i wish i could find where i went wrong, but i really can not. it feels like i am trapped in an utter nightmare. i cried and cried wanting to wake up. i just want to tear myself out of this body and be free. i wanted to post this because i knew on here i can vent this, and if people judge, it would not matter because i probably do not know them.	moderate

coronavirus sent us home, and i do not know what to do i am a freshman in college, and i am an out of state student, meaning that my college is not in the state of my home address. my home life, while not abusive, has played a role in why i have struggled so much with depression and anxiety. my parents, long story short, did not do much to help when they knew i was depressed, and made me feel awful for taking medication and struggling overall. they are not a support system for me at all, and i am not close enough to any of my other family members to talk to them, which means that my pri amary source of help was my university is counseling center. my uni just closed and moved to all online classes because of the coronavirus, which means that i wi will now be stuck at home in another state with no access to any mental health care. i am too afraid to talk to my parents about getting a therapist here in my current state. plus my parents work and i do not have a car, meaning i could not get to an appointment. my friends all live in another state i literally do not have a single friend in the state i have to be in now my high school was not in this state meaning that i wi will not see anyone for a long ti ame potentially until next august. i have dealt with suicidal thoughts for nearly a year now, and recently had a minor incident of self harm. i feel incredibly alone knowing that counseling is not an option and that i potentially would not be able to see any of the friends i have made in college for five months. after that amount of ti ame, i do not even know if they wi will want to reconnect. i just do not know what to do. i feel so completely isolated.	moderate

i hate this world i just hate this world, politics is extremely frustrating, cli amate change constantly makes me mad, my dog is getting old i am scared he wi will die soon. i hate myself for being awkward, every fucking ti ame i talk to a stranger i fuck up. i hate it. i want to inflict pain on my self, i want to cut, i constantly bottle up my feelings, then when i can not take it i lash out alienating the people around me. i got back into smoking again. every ti ame i think it wi will numb the pain it does not. people make fun of me for being awkward, i want to hit them, i want them to feel pain but i know my punches wi will be weak. whenever i tell someone i am depressed they just blow it off and tell me to man up. i just want a girlfriend. i just want some fucking support, i do not want to be alone anymore. i just want to run away, run away from all my problems. thanks for reading. at least i know someone is listening to me.	moderate

coronavirus sent us home, and now i am completely lost... i am a freshman in college, and i am an out of state student. my home life, while not abusive, has played a role in why i have struggled so much with depression and anxiety. my parents, long story short, did not do much to help when they knew i was depressed, and made me feel awful for taking medication and struggling overall. they are not a support system for me at all, and i am not close enough to any of my other family members to talk to them, which means that my pri amary source of help was my university is counseling center. my uni just closed and moved to all online classes because of the coronavirus, which means that i wi will now be stuck at home in another state with no access to any mental health care. i am too afraid to talk to my parents about getting a therapist here in my current state. plus my parents work and i do not have a car, meaning i could not get to an appointment. my friends all live in another state i literally do not have a single friend in the state i have to be in now my high school was not in this state meaning that i wi will not see anyone for a long ti ame potentially until next august. i have dealt with suicidal thoughts for nearly a year now, and recently had a minor incident of self harm. i feel incredibly alone knowing that counseling is not an option and that i potentially would not be able to see any of the friends i have made in college for five months. after that amount of ti ame, i do not even know if they wi will want to reconnect. i just do not know what to do. i feel so completely isolated.	moderate
something i wrote that helps me deal with the voices in my head bad thoughts go away, for i am brave another day. i wi will strive, i wi will succeed. depression wi will not conquer me. i have been dealing with depression since i have been a child, but being a golden child i have had to keep it hidden so that i look normal. keep up a i amage so my siblings and cousins can be better versions of me. i used to write poems and short stories to deal with the thoughts and pain, but all the shit like what do you have to be depressed about? , you live in the uk, how can you he depressed? keep pushing me back down again. like i am not supposed to feel sad, not allowed to feel emotion because i am in a better position than others. i guess i am just trying to reach out and see how others deal with this shit world, how to deal with not loving yourself or where you are in life and the person others want you to be while sti will being true to yourself. i have stopped my anti depressants and all i have now is my writing, i just hope they help someone else out there that feels like me. i love you all.	moderate
i am so close to done no one knows me on here which is good because to my family i try and keep it together but i have no idea what to do at this point. like, i have been taking an ssri for about weeks now and feel no i amprovement and i have no idea how to word how i feel to dr is or counselors so whatever i do to help with depression i generally give up on after a while with no i amprovement. people just assume i am handling it because i have not failed university yet. i know i need to be able to talk better with my gp so i can get the medication right but for some reason, i can never find the right words.	moderate

spring break and the coronavirus this semester in college has been really good to me. my classes are decently interesting, i am actually talking to my peers on a regular basis rather than keeping to myself, and i made my first friend outside of people i already know. i dreaded spring break because i did not want to be at my house alone. my parents work night shift, usually together, so i am alone at night and while they sleep during the day. but i went camping with some friends the first weekend, and caught up on some video games for the rest of the week. but i am sti will getting depressed more and more. now, thanks to the coronavirus, my university has decided to extend spring break an extra week, and i am worried it is going to get even worse. i get it is a safety issue and i am selfish for making it about me, but damn this sucks. this part of the year semester is always hard for me and when my depression is its worst. i thought i would be okay because this semester is going so much better than last year, but now it is going to be horrible like always.	moderate
stupidly forgiving when i am depressed i feel nothing or a gross sinking feeling. but when i am happy i feel so excited to not be depressed i forget how other people did me wrong. this is not to say i blame anyone for having depression but me, i know it is uncontrollable at this point. but when people degrade me, make fun of me, manipulate me, and use me i often know it is happening but i internalize my thoughts and feelings. i usually forgive them because it is always someone i want to stay close to, and i feel them drifting away. it is hard to not blame myself because i know i was too nice and giving. i know they can tell they mean a lot to me so they take advantage. no matter what they know about my past they use it against me every ti ame. i am trying to stop over sharing and being too kind. it is difficult since i am used to mistreatment from my parent and caring for people who do not care about me. everyone makes mistakes but it does not make me feel less stupid. setting boundaries is new but i am learning so i do not get walked over anymore. it is just embarrassing when you re own friends laugh at you, do not congratulate you, and let you suffer alone when they know you re upset.	moderate
i am a failure in my job and to an extent, life. before you ask me to quit, i am conscripted in the military. serving as a hr clerk due to my history of depression. i am fucking done with my office. what is the point of working hard when you do not get anything and people who do not work gets everything? now before you say i am working just for the rewards, i am not. i work hard because i have a strong work ethic and i want to learn as much as possible. i am just fucking pissed that people who do not deserve it get it. i could not care less if no one including me did not get any recognition awards. before you say i do not know them, they are complete assholes that lick bosses balls, look down on uneducated people me and a few others because we did not make it through a certain educational qualification and people with mental health issues. they do nothing at work, take constant breaks, chit chat non stop and always on their phones. however when i decide to take a break they say i am malingering and mentally weak. i am threatened with legal action because i was legiti amately sick after my grandfather is death extreme vertigo due to fatigue . when i work they think i am desperately trying to outshine anyone. i am so fucking done with this place. no matter what i do i am thisliked and misunderstood. when i try to explain myself they say i should either be obedient and keep quiet, or i am too sensitive because the world works this way. i actually have thoughts of suicide because i have no idea how to cope for the next year. i do not want to be a fucking cog in the machine and thrown out when they do not need me. i want to be more than myself, is that so wrong? thanks for listening to my rant.	moderate
who am i? i do not know how i feel some days i feel completely happy that i have someone, but in a instant after having a great ti ame i turn into a thiscouraging waste, i always think why are they happy for me, i am never pleasant on how i look, do, or say. are they just doing this out of pity? am i really enough for them? on going question i ask myself and try to change my persona again and again, deprive myself from eating. i most the ti ame just want to cancel the world and just live alone, but why did i search for someone and find them, am i just trying to fi will a hole inside of me? i really do not understand myself anymore.	moderate

to the kid i saw on the overpass today i am currently finishing training as a truck driver and was on my way back to mo after months otr. i came up to a sudden stop in traffic today on i in nc. more cops than i have ever seen and firetrucks. i am talking at least cop cars on both sides of the highway and the middle. i kept a lookout for an accident until i got closer and saw one of the firetrucks had a ladder extended to a highway sign on the overpass. i i ammediately knew what was likely happening and looked up at the sign when i went under the pass at mph. i locked eyes with this kid, who couldnt be over and looked absolutely broken standing at the edge ready to jump into traffic. he looked over and we just stared at eachother as i passed by, and before i could even react i was yards down the road. it really hit hard since i have felt that feeling of hopelessness before, battles it for years, and have lost friends to it. i wish i could have stopped for you and said a few things i that wish people would have said to me when i thought there was no point. whoever you are, i hope you re sti will here with us and hope that you find meaning in this crazy mess we call life. i know it is a longshot, but if you happen to be on here please reach out to me.	moderate
 am i am not sure if never actually having genuine feelings for anyone is something that is due to me hating myself at a very young age or due to trauma. i can not do it now, i have tried but i get bored, it is all so pointless to me like explaining how i felt and how i acted to someone worried them. everything is calculated to me, emotions, conversations, building a whole character then l m just this nothingness once it is not needed anymore. nothing and no one matters, i can move and sti will gain friends through this. but you can not talk about it without someone bitching about how you do not like them. that chatty character loves you, but i do not care beyond necessary.	moderate
this virus is ruining everything hey everyone this is my first post on this subreddit but i feel like i just need to vent. everything is grinding to a standsti will because of this stupid virus going around. my college is moving to online instruction and i do not learn well on computers so i feel like i am wasting my ti ame and money. what is worse is i live on campus for the sole reason of getting away from my parents and now i can not even go back because they are closing the residence halls until further notice. this whole thing is such an overblown mess and everyone is freaking out over it. i can not even enjoy my last semester at school because of this ridiculous virus and i am back home with my toxic narcissist parents. i just feel like i am not making any real progress with anything. i do not want to be at this house but i have no money and a car payment every month because where i live, if you do not have a car you can not really get anywhere. if i had known better i would have gotten a beater car but my job laid me off only a couple of weeks after i signed for it. it just feels like everything is crashing down around me and the only solution is to just die. i do not want to ki will myself, but i just need all of this stress and bullshit to just stop for a little while. my anxiety is through the roof because of this virus and being unemployed. i can not stand any of this. anyone else being really affected by this coronavirus? thanks for reading this far if you did, it means a lot.	moderate

i am looser i had a lot of friends but when it is friendly someti ames you have to be on your own, i was always sensitive to someone is negative emotions and did not want to cause such. maybe they were not real friends but if i was harder many things would be different. i began to blame others for my failures but i realized that i was weak. i began to blame myself for these failures. i know what a sinister sensitive, empathic, weak character, individualist. by this he bypasses me a lot in life. i can not build a healthy relationship, i got into myself and when i know that i wi will feel negative emotions, i give up the person who is the cause because i am whirling that i could not cope with them anyway. what to do after realizing this. the world is for the winners. i suffer especially because i am seen as a pretty cool and attractive person and then it turns out he is lagging behind. but never mind, i wi will lose my life because i was born like that. thank you for reading. i wrote what i felt.	not depression

the perfect student i do not know how to even describe this feeling, but i wi will try my best. ever since i started school, i was the model student. i took part in music, sports and got almost straight as in my classes. but here is my dilemma. i do not feel good about it. i am advanced in a few classes, but i feel dumb and stupid and pit myself down whenever i do not understand something, i start to hate myself, even if the thing i am learning is actually difficult i sti will feel dumb. i fall into this state where i start questioning myself, i start saying to myself that i am useless, good for nothing, ugly. i try to be good at other things like music and sports, but i get put down by myself thinking it is not possible to sustain yourself in those fields. i lose motivation to do things, and sit around, sulking. i hate my body, i have received multiple comments about my weight and acne from close family, which almost led me to start starving myself and c . i do not want to continue, this is way to long anyway, but whoever reads this thank you, i am truly grateful.	not depression
wassup, it is your boi...hiding in a closet for two hours. so after a mini meltdown in the shower last night, in which i slapped myself in the face a few ti ames, and literally clawed at my arms and back and head with my short yellow, but thankfully manicured fingernails i decided to have a walk. my dog was just staring at me, she wants to figure me out so bad. yesterday morning i but on some alan watts, walked her for like an hour, got high. we danced and played. unfortunately i am a year old dope who had to move back with his mom cause i built no career ski will that is highly sought after, and las vegas is a shit place to find work unless you love sales, cleaning others wastes, or had a recent lobotomy. do lobotomies make life si ampler for the person or is the poor bastard too scrambled to care i wonder? i wonder if lobotomies are sti will legal? hmm. so i dry up, grab my thickest coat, my dirtiest shoes and head out into the neon concrete desert that is fremont street aka old las vegas . the original major strip of this carnival of adult amusements and hollow tourist thistractions. i am being overly negative without a hint of irony or humor, i wi will explain fremont for those who only visited once while drunkenly living what i am sure you thought was going to be a vacation si amilar of excitement and absurdity of say the film the hangover or have delusions but have not visited yet. fremont street is a strip mall that should of been flattened and turned into a park. at least all the homeless would have nicer conditions to sleep on at night. you can buy benzos off some kid in the middle of the street for less than it costs to park, the security and even the cops are out of shape with visible neck tats and look like they can not be bothered to run to their car let alone handle a crazy person if shit went down. thankfully nevada is not very violent. these thugs out here are made of paper and i am not even an inti amidating dude.i am like lbs soaking wet with a neutron star in my pocket, but my joy and wonder has been warped into reclusivity and bottled anger. so most people i have noticed recently just avoid eye contact now. nice in the moment, but like i said i am not no tough guy. i just give them the stink eye so no one talks to me. anyway enough of that shit, lets get to the dumb things and why i am in my closet like a prisoner put in solitary. for one, always wear an extra layer or two before walking in the cold. did i forget to mention my license got suspended last month? i am going to clear it up next month and be back on the road, but yeah i decided to walk from my apartment to fremont. the walk was an hour and twenty....going one way, in degree weather. i am a fucking dummy. can not stay inside though. despite the fact that my whole day yesterday was just applying to jobs, mom came in and she needs help. so as long as i do not have full ti ame work to help out, my brain is constantly chattering... it is not good enough. other men take care of their mothers around the age of . are you a man? she is being nice, but we both know you are a cancer to her life at this point. i am a burden. ..,yeah strolling ai amlessly at pm alone is the smart thing to do right?! let us go! fremont was d e d. dead. so much for the city that never sleeps. i stopped by one of the two bars i have found in this state that agrees with me, atomic liquor. no one but two bartenders, a couple and the doorman were in attendance. their was a motel across the street that caught my ear however. a gate locked monthly budget stay motel apartments. i can not recall the name of the place but it is not i amportant. gaudy parking lot with what looks like a very well crafted twisting statue of a rv trailer standing up crooked yet steady in the middle of it, behind the locked gate like a silent guardian summoned by rednecks and pbr sacrifices. the lot was lit up, but not one building had lights on. in fact the whole lot was empty. no cars, no ground security, and no people living in it. last year this place was standing tall, with regular guests actual people staying in it. some weekends people would have mini block parties and performers in this place when the gates were open. now, it is a creepy neon ghost town, that plays sinatra to no one nonstop. i tried to make a video on it but i am staying incognito here for now. in fact this is a growing concern in my neighborhood. as i was wandering, trying to get lost in the city. going up fremont their are several empty lots and locked up motels and single economy lodgings that are just empty, yet on that same corner i see dopesick and desperate people living in tents and wrapped up on the concrete sleeping. all the money this city makes in tourism, alcohol sales, restuarants, casinos, yet i have never seen more homeless and people with little to no employment like las vegas. i am went past three blocks of potential halfway houses and possible lodging for these people so they can at least start trying to get off their feet. nope, their is a nasty ass siegel suites where hookers go to die every two blocks here that charges a week though. the really thisturbing and fucked thing to me. some of these abandoned buildings had paintings of fake doors and windows on them. i tripped out, they were colorful and well done. lots of yellows and stark reds swathes the outside walls. hell the painted windows even had sketches of people hanging out of them like friendly neighbors. but the doors weren t real, the windows weren t real. the lots were cracked, the weeds in the concrete reclai aming it is territory from lack of maintenance. the gates high and solid, maintained in better shape than the buildings it was protecting. with that rolling around in my skull i was in no good shape to be alone i was not actually alright that night to begin with and eventually made the hour and a half trek back home. right before i eventually went to sleep, which did not happen until am for those curious i think ive only managed about hours of sleep in hours, i was up at am today for no fucking reason . read another post i wrote on here, just to see if anyone gave a shit which some of you actually read, one guy even commented on it. as goofy as it sounds i was dreading seeing any responses to it. i wi will probably avoid reading this post for a while too. way way too raw and sensitive, but i really want to i amprove my writing and my social ski wills are basically being rebuilt on reddit so i welcome criticism. even a your writing is pompous shit you pervert is a load healthier than what my demons keep whispering in my ear recently. now that i think about it, why am i sitting typing this in my closet? oh yeah, it is comfortable.	not depression
i am having a really hard ti ame enjoying anything i do. i have been dealing with pretty severe anxiety for several years now, it is better but by no means cured. i suspect i have depression as well but i have never been diagnosed. for months i have really struggled to find anything i am passionate about, even when i do things that used to be my favorite things. i am currently in college which contributes to a lot of my anxiety thankfully i am about to graduate though. i have an internship, play club baseball my favorite sport , see a psychiatrist weekly, and often play video games or watch tv shows. i do not drink or smoke, and i spend a good amount of ti ame socializing with friends i do not like socializing though and never really have, but that is a different story . basically, my internship is in my dream job field and i am sick of it already. i have played baseball my whole life, and often can not be bothered to go to practice. i am taking classes on interesting topics, and often forget to do or ignore my assignments until after midnight the night before they are due. video games only frustrate or bore me after a short ti ame, and i do not care at all about any tv shows i watch. i feel like i am very busy, doing a lot of things that should make me happy, but nothing is. what do you do when you feel like this, and how can i make my passions something i actually enjoy again?	not depression

i f am in a downward spiral and it never stops this is my first ever post on reddit so i am sorry if it violates any rules or anything! this is super long so there wi will be tldr at the end... the world is ending and that is the only way to describe how i feel. the world is ending and i am suffocating but it is not to anybody else. background i have had depression anxiety for as long as i can remember. i have a wildly complicated horrible relationship with my mother a single mother who raised me, an only child, by herself and a friendly relationship with my father who was not around much until i was like so it is like not at all a parental kind of relationship. i am in my last semester of college and it is the hardest thing i have ever had to do. i am overloaded with hours of classes and working hours days a week. i do not have any friends. i used to but as i get older the depression gets worse. my self esteem is wrecked. i have incredible social anxiety that is also gotten worse as i get older. the actual only human contact i have is my wonderful boyfriend m who lives with me. he is patient and supportive in every way possible and showed me what love truly is. his family are amazing people and i love them too. they are everything i wanted in my family as a kid. i regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication. two things have triggered my downward spiral the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month but i have since found and been back on them but only for about days and this is also my fault and i am kicking myself for this and the severing of my relationship with my mother. she had me young and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever. she is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety, regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since i hit puberty. because of all of this i am incredibly depressed and anxious and it is getting worse with each passing day. something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me. but on top of this, i have been physically sick with the flu which is going around in my area amp it has caused me to miss my class last week. it is days a week for hours. but i am able to work at home because we use our laptops to run the program we work on, so i have been keeping up with schoolwork. last friday was our midway presentation on our final projects i graduate this may and i ended up having a full on panic attack because i did not have enough money to print my presentation out on my university account and i left my wallet at home because my boyfriend drove me to school. it was already past ti ame the class had started so i ran outside to try to calm down but everything had built up and i could not stop crying. needless to say i did not go to class. i emailed my professor an embarrassingly cringey email about what happened and he has not responded. attendance is i amportant in this class this past weekend was mardi gras which i did not participate in because it turns out i have a sinus infection right after getting the flu. i have a dr note for this. i relapsed on my antibiotics and had to go back today to get a stronger prescription. mardi gras classes resumed today at . my class starts at . i got a drs note because i obviously sti will feel bad coughing up mucus, sneezing constantly, blowing my gross snotty nose every seconds, deep mucusy cough every seconds. it is not pretty and the class is freaking hours long and i do not want to subject anyone else to that either??? the classroom is tiny. so i sent hi am it. i said i can present when i come back this friday. he has yet to respond to that too. i am terrified i am going to fail and not graduate. i have to graduate because i have an amazing job lined up for me afterwards. tldr it feels like bad thing after bad thing keeps happening to me and i really want to just give up but i have so much pressure to not give up that it makes me so fucking anxious!!! my anxiety is crippling me right now. i do not really know why i posted this and i am not really expecting any responses. but if you had any kind words to say that would be really appreciated...	not depression
i have feelings for a girl that goes for the best looking guys she can get it makes me insecure and even angry, i dont want to be her friend bc if i talk to her i always regret it. as soon as my feelings are doused, i wi will not care anymore about her i need my self worth if i want to survive. is this a normal occurrence in group homes? ive never had to experience something like this before. i dont know why i care, i am confused about my sexuality. i can be really calm and be asexual but i can also explode bc i i amagine that girl having sex in my home while i have feelings for her. i think i am unreasonably occupied with someone is sexual life, but i really want to stop caring and become transgender	not depression
hey everyone. just a question i have been seriously, chronically depressed for months now, and since january i have read about of one page book. it is not that i can not read it, i just have no motivation to. i see all the books i wanted to read collecting dust because i do not want to read them. does anyone else here have that issue? when i do start reading i do enjoy it, but it is like i am procrastinating from doing so. i love to read, but the motivation to actually get up and read is actually crippling, and it is thistressing. i used to get through a book every or weeks, yet i have been stuck on this one for over months, and it is very short. instead of reading i wi will stay up on my laptop browsing endless shit. just want to see if i am alone really...	not depression

considered suicide for the first ti ame today never thought i would. the idea terrifies me, and the abyss of the aftermath, even worse. as a senior in high school i am expected to go to college next year, work towards a job, be an actual member of society, as we all are. i hate everything about college, but it is either i blow my parents money for four years or get a full ti ame job this june. i love music, i want to make it, i would love to successfully be a musician, but know how sli am the odds are of actually sustaining financial wealth from any form of art. today, i finally came to the point where the idea of dying right here right now is comforting. none of the bullshit in the coming years wi will have to be dealt with. i have officially maxed out on the fun and carefree years of life where you depend on others, at this point i really do not have a single think motivating me to keep moving. i have been attracted to both girls and other boys before but never really wanted to date anyone, i am not one who fantasizes of a family one day or a big house or literally anything beyond this point in life. how am i supposed to even walk up anymore.	not depression
i cry less and less i was always a crybaby. years ago i cried almost every night, certainly every week. but since a month or i almost do not anymore. last ti ame i really cried was when qinni died, an artist i followed for a long ti ame. i got into an argument with my mom last week, i told her that the thing i would want the most is to ki will myself. normally i would go to my room and cry for at least a couple hours, but i did not. maybe because i knew those were empty words? i would not ki will myself, i know that for sure. lately i am feeling very stressed, i am in a constant state of feeling like i am about to throw up. but for some reason i do not cry. i mean, if i really try to then i manage to squeeze out a couple of tears. but normally i would have a breakdown, go to sleep and the next morning i would feel fresh and fruity. but i do not. is it good? is it bad? maybe i am just getting older, i do not know. it feels weird.	not depression

alone in a full house here again, after a particularly brutal morning with the wife, our youngest was diagnosed with autism about years ago and it is been a struggle at ti ames. i noticed recently it wearing on her more than usual so i attempted to engage her in conversation to figure out what we can do or i can do better going forward. she turned on me and let me know that in her head it is my fault she has quote a retarded kid she has to take care of forever . this sent me reeling and after a few back and forth i thisengaged because nothing was going to help at the moment . our son got lead poisoning at the home we used to live at and we could not figured out at first why he wasnt progressing and was withdrawing from us, we took hi am to his dr and when he found nothing i believed hi am, because i am not a doctor. this was my cardinal sin in in her mind, she switched offices and new doctor suggested a lead test that came back dangerously high. while evaluating the lead damage he was diagnosed as asd, autism spectrum thisorder which shares some symptoms with lead poisoning and many belive can contribute to autism. there is no medical proof of this and asd is caused by genetics, behaviors attributed to asd hand to mouth, sensory issues are thought to be the reason there is a higher than average occurrence of lead among asd children. upon diagnoses our landlord of years i willegally evicted us, but was successful due to his lawyer, the move, which nearly had us homeless and the recent diagnoses nearly ended us but we fought through it our son is a smart and happy yo with communication issues who has i amproved leaps and bounds since then but can sti will be a handful at ti ames, but i believe he wi will be fairly high functioning by the ti ame he is an adult my wife is borderline verbally abusive to me and someti ames our family and has a terrible temper but i thought we were in this together and its devastating to hear her say these things, i can deal with alot but it is one of those occasions where i can never unhear those words and now i wi will carry them forever i know that what i describe is unhealthy and have known for awhile that maybe it was not going to be forever but i just can not let my family come apart, i thought we were in the trenches together but apparently not, she has always acted as if she deserves this life she pictures in her head without any work at it and i have enabled her by trying g to give it to her neither of us really have any support system around here so a split would basically mean she leaves and has nowhere to really go nearby and i would likely have to quit my job and start over a few hours north near my family i know therapy may help but it is not realistic and she wouldn t go even if it was possible sorry for the long one i bulletpointed for easier reading and while i know the answer isnt going to be in the comments just letting it out has helped a bit, i have a few friends but no one i feel i could dump this onto,	not depression

what is this feeling? i know what it is i have had this blank post open for the last four hours. i have yet to formulate words. i have been so inspired to write lately and it seems my hands can not keep up with my pen. but here i am, wordless. this is not going to be pretty. this is not going to be edited. this is not going to be long. i have not felt depressed in years. i mean, seriously. years. i have been sad. i have been through some really rough shit that nobody should have to go through. hell, even my body is degenerating. but i have not been depressed. i have handled break ups before. i have handled not being sure of my future. but right now...it seems so much harder. i am going through the motions. i feel like a zombie someti ames. my partner, who i am severely in love with, is for the first ti ame, not depressed. and now for the first ti ame in what seems like forever, i am. and i know it wi will pass. that partner and i, the one that i am in love with, are transitioning out of a our partnership. my heart is breaking. i do not want to feel anymore. i know this is what has to happen. and i know it is going to hurt like hell. and i know i wi will survive it. but right now, i am unemployed after being fired for being sick. my dog is attached to my partner. one day in the general future, my partner, who shares a bed with me, wi will sleep in the next room over. and he wi will date and explore and experience so much and i am so happy for hi am and i promise i know none of this makes sense because there is no context and i do not need advice or anything because nobody can understand. but i am depressed. for the first ti ame. and i do not know how to tell anyone but my psychiatrist. i have slight bipolar . i was on lithium for a while and transitioned off of it three years ago. i asked hi am to go back on it so i wi will start that tomorrow. i say that i do not know how to tell someone. i do. i just say it. i have a support system. i just do not want hi am to know. i do not want hi am to feel guilty. i do not want to burden hi am. i want hi am to be happy. and he is. i do not want to ruin that. so i wi will tell someone. the first people i am telling, though, are you.	not depression

i am fine, until i exercise. very frustrated. trying to lose weight but after i exercise i get crazy idontwanttomove depressed. i wi will pick a day where i feel fine, hopes are up, mood is up. i wi will go for a walk about to mile round trip. . by the ti ame i get back from that walk, i am destroyed emotionally and physically. weight lifting takes about min for me to break down and hate everything, even though i enjoy the act of going someplace and doing something. any promises i have made, any plans for day, any real rational thought is thrown from the window. i end up laying down and not moving, someti ames to great consequences because nothing matters anymore. exercise is supposed to help depression, and i feel fine until i exercise. add some endorphins to my system and i just can not handle it. i wi will make shit choices until the depression goes away. the next day i can sti will feel it like a hangover. if i power through it and ignore the screaming signals to stop, the problem becomes life halting after about two weeks. ive never made it past the two week mark, as dieing looks great in comparison. what dumbfounds me is how fast and quick i can go from awwwww yeh, lift that weight. to fuck this, fuck you, let us die. i have tried watching my diet, suger spikes or lack of suger or some weird theory somebody had regarding diet. healthy diets and mcdonald is diets had no sway. eatting drinking while before after no change in result. i do not drink alcohol so that is never really in the math. tried exercising less but man this is bullshit. i should be able to go for a run and not want to die emotionally. physically your supposed to feel like shit, i think, but emotionally you should not feel this destroyed from a half hour of lifting weights. any ideas or theory are welcome. i live on ssdi and visiting the doctor is completely out of the question expensive. i live off month, so the thought of a dollars a visit doctor is hilarious to me.	not depression

totally burnt out from studying hi all, prepare for some major venting. for context, this is my fourth year in university and i sti will have one more to go. this sounds like i am on the home stretch, but i really do not feel like it. while my depression has somewhat eased up over the past few months, it is been at the expense of any study motivation i have. while i have never had much wi willpower when it comes to education, and have somewhat coasted through so far, this past year has been the worst. i am at a top uni where falling behind is unacceptable. but that is not really the problem. i despise studying. i hate it with a passion, and i can not do even the si amplest of tasks anymore. i feel nothing but frustration when i think about my degree subject any interest i had is long gone and has been for years. essentially, i am done with this stage of my life and want to move on to working, doing what i love, as i know this is what wi will ulti amately make me happy a routine, structure, the chance to have some i ampact on real life, and meet new people. the trouble is i have sti will got a year to go of this degree. i am not dropping out now since i have invested so much ti ame, struggle and money into the past four years. it is been gruelling but the end is in sight, and yet i feel zero motivation to get there. which means i am stuck in a constantly anxious rut, feeling trapped, and can not focus on anything i want to do because it does not have my full attention. i am basically just in li ambo right now. does anyone else have experience with feeling entirely mentally burnt out from studying in a high pressure environment, and any tips on how to get through this last year without falling into a major depressive spiral again? i just want to get my degree and move on with my life. any advice or solidarity would be much appreciated 	not depression

i am not sure if i am depressed or...? so i have been feeling super low these past few days, and i thought it was sadness, that kinda sadness that just comes every now and then and then leaves, but this ti ame it stayed, and i realize now that it is not actually sadness, but emptiness. like my stomach just feels low and it feels like that feeling you get when you re in a bad mood and your heart just drops to your stomach. this has been going on for a few days now and usually when i get those blue moods it goes away soon enough, mostly after the same day when i go to sleep and wake up, but this ti ame it is different and this is not the first ti ame it happened. i have felt this sadness before too, for a few days and it scared me bc usually my low moods last only for a day and it is not emptiness. last ti ame it went away tho, and i think this ti ame it is not going away maybe bc i am overthinking it? but then again if i am overthinking, idk how to stop overthinking and that makes me more upset. i am extremely sorry if this is not depression and has insulted anyone, but i did not know where else to ask this. it would be greatly appreciated if you could read this and lmk what you think it is. maybe anxiety? i thought that, but i am not scared of anything? i do not feel worried? it is just a low mood in my stomach. i wish someone who has knowledge of this answers me. i am only , i want to live a good healthy happy life and i really do not want to be depressed, or constantly upset. i already booked a guidance appointment to talk to my councellor at school for this, and i am too scared to tell my parents bc they wi will think i am overreacting or i am too young to feel this way, or they wi will just blame it on my phone and take it away, smthg that i really do not want bc this is the only thing that takes my mind off my sadness someti ames. i do not have friends that i trust and am close to enough to tell them this. i am also pretty lonely which upsets me at ti ames, but not this much. also i like bts, a bit band that makes mi willion of ppl happy, and me too, but these days i only feel happy while i am watching them, but as soon as the video ends, i am back to that empty sinking feeling. oh and i also cried my eyes out yesterday, which idk what for, but it made me feel better only for like ish mins, then it was back to feeling sad again. and i cried today too, when i was coming home from school. help?	not depression

everyone reading this is so strong my depression often makes me feel weak. weaker than everyone around me. weak because i can not handle basic tasks like chores and going to work everyday and maintaining relationships like everyone else. especially not while putting on a smile and making it seem like its no big deal. i feel like i just was not cut out for this life. probably many of you can relate. anyway trying to counteract my negative thoughts a little and maybe, hopefully help someone else to do the same. if you really think about it we are not weak, we are super strong. we re strong because even though many of us can not do some of the most basic things like get out of bed everyday, or brush our teeth, we sti will keep on going. we struggle, we suffer, and as much as we want to stop we do not. some of us have our reasons to keep our feelings to ourselves even though we are about to burst. some of us tell as many people as wi will listen. i think both take enormous strength. no matter who you are or what you re going through, you are doing your best and i am proud of you 	not depression

my wi will to live is gone. i was always that one kid who was the world is biggest dick hole to my classmates who were just trying to have fun with me and make good friends. i had no friends to hang with during recess and nobody ever showed up to my birthday parties throughout my whole life. when i got into high school, it was my lifelong dream to stop being lonely and extremely sad and make a few good friends to hang out with, but instead i got made fun of having no friends and being the weird quiet kid that i have been for the past years of my long and pathetic life. i did eventually end up making good friends outside of school. we would always go do something fun like go to the park or go boating and then play video games together. now we see each other extremely rarely because they are busy , probably hanging out with better friends than me or making out with girls. here i sit in bed crying myself to sleep as a sophomore in high school, almost losing all of the few friends i have in my life. my pathetic life is quickly withering away from the constant battles with myself and high school society. all i want is a few good friends to laugh with and maybe a girlfriend too, but i feel so sad and tired all the ti ame with constant thoughts of suicide. last week, i stopped hanging out with my very school friends during lunch which caused me to just completely let go of the hope of a decent life like everybody else at school was privileged to get. i am super close to going on medication that scares my mom to double hell. i am considering switching schools, but it wi will most likely end up worse and would then drive me to suicide. i do not know what to do anymore and i am so close to ending it all.	not depression

happiness comes after pain. this year has been a pain slaughter for me, problems after problems non stop. i keep reminding myself that good things wi will happen despite seeing no actual positive changing. but oh well, we re living on earth not parathise where everything is happy all the ti ame. i keep reminding myself that this storm wi will one day end, and at least it wi will be good for a while. in fact, it is not only me suffering but also my family, except my father who is a dictatorship toxic guy. i was depressed since i was . since that day, i kind of only had hatred inside of me, but these past years i learned a lot from people i never knew how nice they were. heck, i even cried when i met such people. i also learned that by accepting our fates, hardships do not cause the same effect when we think everything is going to be fine all the ti ame. i keep reminding myself that happiness and love comes from the heart of sadness and anguish. just like how medicines are made out of poison. i keep reminding myself that i am not the only one suffering, forced to wake up every day and avoid people only not to feel awkward when talking. i keep reminding myself that everything has a beginning and an end, and death is not the solution. thanks to anyone who read my diary. i hope some ideas may help someone out there who is suffering.	not depression

a venting post confession but some outside opinions would be welcome hey there you all! i hope it is not the incorrect place to put my writing. i just really need to let a few thing go out of my head, get them off my chest. in advice i warn all of you, who accidentally read this, that my grammar wi will probably be horrible, so please bear with me. although i have no idea how could i ever repay your ti ame and effort, apart from a thank you , and telling you that i highly appreciate all insight and opinions, if you managed to get to end of my writing and feel you might have something to say or add, i would be very grateful to learn your opinions. so, buckle up, here we go! i am currently a old white man from the middle eastern part of europe. i am living in a small backwater settlement with not much more than inhabitants a kinda old school place, where the middle aged and older know each other pretty well, but the younger act like they were from the big cities. i never really felt like fitting in, but for majority of my lifeti ame i did not paid attention to it, as it never really bothered me until recently. apart from a few occasional trips i never left my hometown. i was raised here. my family lived in a house with a nice big garden. five of us. my maternal grandparents, my father, my mother and i, the only child. after being at age i was sent to preschool, but my parents took me out after less then a year, because i was always getting sick minor colds, nothing serious, for somehow i always ended up beind sat right next to the window , and i was kept at home ti will elementary school. in school i was concidered a good even exemplary, as they clai amed student and child. during my school years i always had exactly two close friends, everybody else was just an acquaintance, even in my own class. until fourth or fifth grade there was not really any problems with me socially, but as puberty started to kick in amoung us, i slowly started to became the odd one. i always had long hair, and that alone was enough for the others to pick on me. mix it with me being the nerd who always got good grades, was taken to competitions after competitions in natural science and literature subjects, hated popular music, listened to rock metal, never went to parties or clubbing, did not smoke, did not got drunk with the others, never liked dancing or any sports. also as puberty progressed started to i started to gain some weight. nothing to sugarcoat because i would eat that too i was quite chubby. not obese, but i had my handles. after finishing the elementary school, i attented to the local high school, which is located literally next door to my elementary , with of my old class, so we basically brought the social structures with us. before that, we got thistant and separated with one of my close friend up to the point that we did not even spoke to each other for years now. he got buddies with the rich kid of the class, they went to a different school, started clubbing, getting girlfriends, so he lived his normal life, in which there is no place for a nerd like me. during the years of high school my non existent social circle shrunk even more. i replaced my old friend with a new one, so there was three of us again, but apart from occasionally hanging out with them i started to keeping to myself more and more. the others were busy dating and partying, while my attention turned towards reading, paying attention to anything that was in english and playing computer games. i was sti will in the top of my class when it came to the grades, but i had to put literally zero effort in it. i have just read the given texts of the lessons once or twice, even though i am a very slow reader , said a few sentences when i was asked and it was enough for acing the four years. you can i amagine what it did to my attention span, and wi willingness to put effort into anything. during the twelve years i tried to court two girls, but was rejected by both of them. when i told my mother about my first attempt at asking a girl out one of my classmate in sixth grade her reaction was very thisapproving, along the lines of you shouldn t do that! which i think also added an extra weight to my baggage. after that, for a very long ti ame i did not even try to do any advance on any woman. i finished high school with an a degree in all subject they even had mercy on me in sports . i took a succesful language exam in english far more earlier then the rest of the class, without attending to the extra and summer lessons. of course, as bright child buy only in a local sense as it turned out i attended to a university right away. but... i did not really gave it a thought. my family was not too wealthy, and i did not wanted to overwhelm them financially. i was always said that i think maturely, more mature than my age, so that also reinforced my decision of attending to the nearest, cheapest possible university, from where i can get home in an hour so my parents do not have to pay for dorm and such. i literally just take the option of least resistance instead of taking a look into what i am good at or what interests me. now looking back this is one decision i regret. making friends was never my strong suit, and it did not change during the university. but some of the teachers instantly liked me. i also gain entry to an ornithology group and was listed in the crew of the next offical, certified experi ament run by my professor in my very first year. then life decided to take a turn towards the more darker areas. after being done with my first year, during summer break, my mother get i will, almost died and spent days in hospital, mostly in intensive care. i went to visit her every single day. then it turned out that the complications and treatments given to her in attempt to save her life ruined her kidneys. from that moment we started a years long struggle with all the few ups and the many downs. with dialysis, my mother temporarly got better for a while, but after a some ti ame she just gave up on life, refused to attend to dialysis and in the end, let herself pass in excrutiating pain. we tried everything from being kind to being authoritive but nothing worked. the last line i heard from her was go away! go home! leave me alone! as a reaction to my desperate attempt to get her to change her mind. the next day she passed away when i was on my way to the hospital. during this period my grandfather was also getting more and more sick, with more and more severe complications from diabetes and aging. under half a year i lost both my mother and my grandfather. my grandmother was and is totally devastated by the events, yet, god bless her, she is sti will kicking and active, but the age and sorrow is slowly gaining on her. she often clai ames that i am the only reason she is sti will alive. my father become more closed and keeping to hi amself, however, lately he tries to be more open. on my life the toll was huge as well. i dropped out of the university and stayed at home to help if needed. but in the peaceful days when everything was calm, and my help was not needed i started to seperate myself from the world more and more. with no friends, no money and no opportunities to blow off some steam, my only entertainment and escape were the books, movies and pirated video games. later when money was thight i started to work at the local school as an administrator. i kept working there past the death of my mother and grandfather. though it was offically a standard job, my boss had her own civil organisation too, with which i was supposed to help, so i worked overti ame and often during the night too. that once more locked me up in my office and my hometown for good. apart from the occasional movie nights at the theatre in the nearest city i never really had a night off. the paycheck was enough to cover the bi wills and a few insurance but not much more. travelling was not an option, because i did not have money, and i did not and sti will do not have a driver is licence. the overwork and working behind the desk took its toll on my physique too i am tall ish, cm, but also kg, and i am out of breath very easily if i have to maintan constant physical effort. the only thing i can do in a prolonged fashion is walking at a km h speed for hours, but i breaking out in sweat very, and i mean very easily in the first minutes , and my body is covered with soft fat tissue with no hardness of any muscle. these things hintered my confidence when it came down to approaching women as well. i tried to hit it off with two of my colleagues after a years pause, but, again both of them rejected me. so i never really tried any harder than that after the repeated failures. i even gave up on making friends.the few people i know and hang out with are from my workplace. and even towards them i am more and more suspicious, especially since i think i learned to read body language and notice all the small details of aversion on them. as far as i can tell my relationship with them is contrversial at best, because if i organise something, they agree to tag along, but i rarely got invited by them. the one thing that did not change is that once again, i consider exactly two of them my close friend. a handsome young male dance teacher and a beatuiful young musician woman. we often hang out at my place, which i rent out to dance teacher for dirt cheap, as i live in our family house with my grandmother and father talking, getting drunk, playing some games and stuff. someti ames they say that they like me, and they never ask me to leave, even if i tell them that they are free to do so, because i know that i am difficult person to bear. but i just can not shake the thought of they being on good terms with me because that is how they repay me for i rent the place to the man for cheap and because i actively seek to help woman emotionally, beacuse she is a fragile soul there was a few occasions when i spent a good portion of the night with her either in person or on the phone because she needed someone to talk to and reached out for me . this woman is also very attractive and kind, as they say a dame to ki will for , but i am pretty sure i am not her type and suspect that she and the dance teacher are attracted to each other, and are sleeping together, so no room for me in her life. they say that there is nothing between them apart from our friendship, but i know that to man made several attempts at seducing her, and as far as i can tell after half a bottle of hard liquor they playing the flirting game quite good. and that is just the things i see when i am with them. that is why i constatly hint them that they can tell me to get lost if the had enough of my company . apart from the above as today, i sti will do not have a university degree, no driver is licence, and i recently left my job as well, becauce there was a change in the person of the director, and the new boss could not really support neither herself nor me against the attacks from a few co workers and the members of the directional group originating nothing more but personal thisdain. luckily i had a few month worth of expanses saved up in cash, but now my money run out and i live off a loan and the rent the teacher pays me. i am not without a job entirely, though, as a leading agent of an insurance company, who made a life insurance for my grandmother, took an interest in me i was present, actively interfering with the processs when they signed the papers in order to keep my grandmother from accepting a thisadvantegous offer , and she introduced me into a program for new agents with education, professional support and such. because of this, i started to take driving lessons too, but i struggle with it. i also feel unsure about this job opportunity as an insurance agent, as it is a quite controversial trade but everybody, who has authority in the program, even the regional director wants me to stay, even though i tried my best to scare them off. so for now i sti will stick to it, because i think this is my only option to earn some good money as i have literally no other paper about any other, noteable qualification. the only certification i am somewhat proud of is my offical mensa membership but i am suspicious about that too, since i only passed for the second ti ame i took the test when they wanted to open a new local group in the county i live, so i wager they lent me a few extra points, so i pass mark in order to gain more local members. i could not stand to leave the country, because of my grandmother, who is sti will deathly afraid of me gettig hurt or in trouble if i do not spend the night at home. so here i am, jobless, moneyless, without a car, out of oppotunities. a kissless virgin, who does not even bother to approach woman anymore, because i can tell at least a dozen reasons right from the top of my head why they should reject me and go for someone better what measn literally any other man than me . but the hardest part of all i literally have absolute zero motivation or interest towards anything. i can not tell why i keep waking up in the morning and do the tasks i am trusted with. i think it is not even depression as for most of the ti ame i feel and think about absolutely nothing, it is just static in my brain. other ti ames i just feel anything apart from rage, despair, incompetence, overwhelming i ampotence and being sick with everything. i do not even feel the need to change or i amprove my life anymore because as i see it, it would be so much effort for literally nothing. i feel the thiscomfort of not having this or that but only when i witness others living their life. and someti ame i can logically prove myself that i would need this and that if i try. but that is it. all are fleeting all so quickly. yeah, i could earn more money, but for why? my standards are pretty low a place to sleep with a computer and internet acces, some food, and a bathroom. getting an so? why? and how? i mean i would like to have a family and children, of course, but first i would need to induce emotions other than thisgust or thisdain in a woman and keep her attention for more then two minutes. but i am so incompatible with people that it does not go for me just like that, naturally. it would take an enourmous amount of effort and even if i would somehow accidentally succeed, there is sti will a high chance that she would just leave me after i realize that i am the most boring person in the world. my life is so bleak and blank that when i am with my friends i keep making up stories about the adventures and exes i had when i was younger in order to i have something to talk about. and even though i try keep these stories consistent, i feel they see right through it but feel so sorry about me that they just let me keep talking. honestly, all i want to do is run away. i am tired of my life, i am tired of myself. i am uninterested in everything. i just do things so people leave me alone about it. because i sti will hear from the few of them saying why do not you do something with that big brain of yours? why do not you get a nice lady for yourself? because i can not, that is why! because there is no place for me in this entire goddamned world. because all i get is thisdain. which is replaced by hatred if i warn others about something and it turns out that i was right. like i am not even allowed to be correct about anything. smile more! be kinder ask about and talk with people they say! of course, gt gt i lt lt should go out of my way just to get a whole lot of ignorance in return. they just keep talking, but do not know, they just do not understand! the suggest me to make friends... in a settlement where i am the wierdo, who was accused with basically everything from being a homosexual through being a pedofil to being a drug addict?! are they even aware what they are talking about? i am also tired of that few people giving me more credit than i worth. because i literally worth nothing. that is literally my life i am either prasied for something i am not or i am the last, forgotten piece of shit. in my younger age i was actively advocate against suicide. now i wouldn t mind if somehow all of this just would end. i want people to let me go. i do not want to die explicitly. i just want a place where noone knows me. were noone expects or want anything from me. a place where i can finally make peace with the piece of deadweight i am on this world and live the rest of my miserable life in seclusion, being that wierdo from the third floor, who you just see the corner of you eye in the morning and in the evening. i just want the world the stop remind me about what they think i should be. i know i had dreams, i know i had potential. i could have been an astronomer, a doctor, an actor, an electrician, or just a si ample family man. but that is the point. i could have been. but it is over. it is in the past. i can not be any of those things anymore. i just want people to finally agree with me that i played all my cards wrong, succesfully wasted my life, never lived up to my potential, scream and yell at me for being an utter piece of shit, then throw me away and let me wither in peace. i si amply ask the world to leave me alone without giving me signs of hey! why do not you do this or that? is that so much to ask?	not depression

how i managed to get broken up with twice we dated for a year and half and got broken up in the summer, i was grateful for all the memories and hardships we shared my st real relationship . i sti will can not get over her. we made several attempts in trying to remain friends, but our feelings for one another really made i ampossible. but then she came back again to my life, entertaining the idea of us getting back together again. and i honestly believed her... up until she posted herself with another guy her new boyfriend . i did not say anything to her, i just removed her from all socials after that. i felt like she abused my tolerance and for the first ti ame i realized she really did not care about how i felt anymore. i guess now i just can not get over the fact that she did that to me, feelings i felt were past me, revitalized back and it just hurts more now than ever before.	not depression

large stigma getting annoying this is just a rant i guess. deep in thought about what i have went through in the past couple of years and the giant stigma revolving around depression. people have stopped talking to me for the most part. while transitioning to no contact, friends seemed only contacting out of pity, short conversations, not contacting me first ever, and if i did not contact them back within a couple days they just stopped responding. people acted like i was such a terrible friend because i was going through a rough ti ame. not saying i was the best of friends, but i sti will made regular contact at first when i finally felt better they were no longer there. i get it that isolation does not help me but when that is the only thing that feels okay and they just let it happen, then i am consumed. it is not like people would ask me to hang out and i would decline, i never got asked. they are too much of a downer. geee thanks, that is really going to help my confidence that my friends are not just going to leave me once i am not useful to them every day... i am a social being. it is part of what makes me thrive. i am like a plant and everyone is starving me from nutrients and then wondering why it is dying in the dark. check up on your friends, and i need to take my own advice on this, do not just write someone off because you re afraid of their response. just ask them whatever question you have and you can at least go from there. remember for the most part no response ever is a response.	not depression

hit the weight room it is the only solution... that and stay off of social media. lifting is one of the only things that is helped me, it really gets the emotions under control and makes you realize how powerful you really are and numbs your feelings. i just got back from planet fitness and straight grinded for an hour and a half nonstop. first i did pull ups, then chest machine, then curling and free weight exercises. i looked at my veins after and i feel like a beast and my emotions have faded quite a bit now too. i am telling you guys, do this every day you can, and you ll see i amprovement. i love you guys, you wi will all be fine!!!	not depression

i have lost the wi will to live. i broke up with my fianc e about a year and a half ago. we were together for years. since then, i have not been able to meet anyone. i do not know what to do anymore. no one seems to think i am worth their ti ame. i have been ignored, ghosted or flat out told to fuck off . i even had some tell me nice try, but that line sucks. t try again. i have not even been on one day since my ex, let alone any sort of physical contact. to make things worse, i lost my job due to sickness last summer. so i have been unemployed since then with barely little income. plus, i live in a tiny town of about people and the very few friends i do have are all in relationships. loneliness does not even begin to describe how i feel anymore 	not depression
it never fucking ends i am . dealt with all sorts of mental shit for my whole life. tried everything i can possibly think of to get rid of the crippling anxiety, depression. and therapy, of course. every once in a while i have a better day or few and i think i am finally getting better and would not be miserable anymore. then it all just comes back no matter what i do. at this point i get suicidal thoughts almost every day and it feels like in all the years of struggle i have never made much progress. today i sat through all my college classes literally dripping sweat because i was panicking over every fucking thing and trying not to let the depression come back. get home, i am hopeless and suicidal again. i wasted all my teenage years, and in my childhood i was a recluse. there is a girl that likes me for some reason but i am not even brave enough to talk to her. i want to quit my job and find some way to end it. what the fuck are you supposed to do when everything you try ends in failure?	not depression

to everyone in this sub some words to help ease your pain hopefully it is helpful! i have had really low points in my life and i never thought i would be where i am now. i know how it feels where you feel so empty inside it is almost as if your mind craves that feeling of loneliness and sorrow. we all have our own reasons to why we get depressed and we all understand this is not a competition. it is a way of life our person has been consumed and trapped in the roots of this intertwined realization of reality and unfortunate events. i am praying for you all and wishing for the best outcome for those who suffer from the grips of depression. what helped me was looking at where i was and who i became. i hated looking at myself in the mirror but i took that and lit a fire in my soul because i did not ask to be here like everyone else but i am here and i am not going to keep letting life kick me in the ass! we are all stronger than we think and we can do much more than we perceive is achievable!! next ti ame you wake up in the morning make yourself smile look in the mirror and say i am fucking ready for this shit and get yourself out there!! it is a big world we live there is always going to be ugly but it is when you recognize the beauty is when the rest fades away!	not depression

i think i have finally hit rock bottom. the blows keep adding up. last night i was in an accident and my honest to god first thought was should i just end it? last night i was involved in an auto accident on my way home from work. it was not my fault, but my vehicle is most likely totaled and i wi will probably sti will owe money on it after everything is payed out. i do not have a car. i do not have a credit card so it wi will be hard to rent one, and i am so i wi will have to pay extra fees on top of that. i only had this car for months. last month i was diagnosed with type diabetes. it has so far been an easy transition into my new lifestyle but i fear for the medical bi wills starting to pile up. i am currently dollars k in debt with student loans. when i graduated college no one would even give me an interview. i accepted my first job offer but work in a miserable job field with an overbearing boss. i work as a driver manager and manage a fleet of trucks but we have been severely lacking freight options these past couple months which has led to me not meeting my revenue expectations, leading to my boss being on my case every second of every day. due to my i willnesses i have had to miss numerous days of work and now i fear without a car i wi will not be able to make it to work and, along with me not meeting expectations, wi will lead to me being fired. which if i am fired, i wi will further be in debt seeing as just two weeks ago i signed a lease for a new apartment and am locked in until next february. i do not know what to do. i am miles from my family had to relocate for my job and am in an increasingly unstable financial situation. i am lonely, my only social interactions are at work or on xbox live. i am too poor to go out and all my friends live back home. i feel isolated	not depression

emotions i am in so much mental pain right now. my best friend had a close friend of hers attempt and possibly succeed in suicide. another friend had some old guy she knew be a creep. another person i honestly do not like all that much had many family and school problems. so many people have problems and i can not help. since the first two are in my only friend group, everyone who could help me is out. the last one has only me as a support system so i can not leave them. i ended up cutting to deal with it and my mother found out. i convinced her it was a one ti ame thing and i was fine, but she wi will check my arms and legs and i need to spend more ti ame with them. i know they want to help but this is more punishment than anything. self harm is one of the only effective coping mechanisms i have. my mental state is worse just being around them. at least i do not need to do therapy again, i hated therapy. i also hated that my parents made me do the most ineffective coping mechanisms for me constantly. again, i know they want to help, but i refuse to trust them. she also said it is affecting her and upsetting her and i feel so fucking guilty. i just feel so alone and like a nuisance. i want to talk to my boyfriend and get hugs without feeling selfish or guilty. i want to get a diagnosis for all the shit i know is wrong with me. i want medication to maybe help me feel better. i want everything ok for myself and everyone else. i feel like i need to punch something, scream so loud, cry so hard. why can not things get better?	not depression

you do not have to see the whole staircase, you just have to see the first step i do not care what it is but just take small steps, whatever is bothering you is real and this is thisease. whatever step you see to get better such as brushing your teeth, cleaning your face, taking a shower, etc. depression sucks but the best way i know to break it is to just start small and even if it is one small thing any progress is better than no progress. you take that one step and your one step higher and one step closer to the stop and each small step is one closer to the top. if you want advice comment it below and i wi will try my best to help!	not depression

i just hate the thought of continuing to live the way i do. so, to put things into perspective i was diagnosed with autism spectrum thisorder at age . as a result, i have a lot of issues with getting things organised, socialising on a daily basis leading to an overwhelmingly introverted lifestyle and even attempting to do things i either have to get done, or just trying to partake in an activity i enjoy. the result of this has just been me, doing the bare mini amum everyday. i feel like i am slowly just becoming less and less productive. i have stopped playing video games, which were once my dedicated pasti ame for years, and brought me large amounts of joy over my life. i feel like i have let down my only friends that i managed to make in the last year, by removing myself from talking to them, and i honestly think at this point they believe i have just ditched them. i am now, turning in just a few months, and honestly, i do not want to keep living in such an awful way, where i do not feel compelled to do anything, or get anything done. that is all i really want to get out of my head.	not depression
done tired of trying to achieve things i will never get. fucking sick of trying over and over again, just to be let down by myself or somehing i didnt see coming. my grandma says i give up too easily, and that i just expect to be good at things and give up up when i am not i ammediately good at something. well no fucking shit sherlock. after years upon years of being let down i would expect to be good at something. sports? nope. most videogames? nope. driving? nope. recently i made my schools baseball team. i am on the practice team but i was happy ubtil today when i thiscovered i wi will not be going to away games. one of the main reasons i tried out in the first place was to try and make friends. it seemed like no one wanted to be around me. i am just a fucking class clown and that is it. that is all i will ever be. no one wants to actually be my friend. whenever i try to talk to people, they listen for about five seconds, then someone else talks to them and they abandone me. i am just so fucking sick of it all. i dont think i can take it much longer. when i was sent to a private schools instead of the hughschool all of my friends were going to because i got in too much trouble, i cut myself. as i was doing it, i remember thinking, this is just a stunt to get attention, to make my asshole grandparents feel bad for me. but as i cut deeper and more and more, i realized how much of a good idea it might be to actually ki will myself. the next morning i showed my wounds to my grandmother, and she got mad and yelled at me, and then sent me to tennis practice in a short sleeve shirt. then she tried to institutionalize me. i hate my life so much i just want it ti be over. i dont want friends anymore, i dont try get good at anything anymore, i dont even want to try get off the practice team, all i want to do is lay down and bot wake up. i can not stress that enough. its incredible how much i want to die, its a miracle i am sti will alive. i have no mental i willnesses like many people here have, and i know this isnt a bad of a situation as many others may be. but i just wanted to see if this would get it off my chest and maybe, just maybe get good advice.	not depression

actions are self destructive though consciously i am not. hey all, i rarely post on reddit, but reading so many different stories here and a situation that happened today made me want to reach out and get your opinions. me i recently was told by my therapist that i have depression. i mean i went to her because i thought was told that i have depression by the people around me, but it helped hearing it from someone official. currently, i would say i have been doing better compared to a few months ago with a combination of understanding my heightened anxious feelings, medicine, and gym. the situation my boss called me to his office and pointed out something that was due from me for a while. we talked some and the summary basically being help me, help you . he paused for a while to figure out the right word he wanted to use and said, yes. self destructive. that is what you are self destructive . he said, i do not know what happened to you when you were a kid but stop thinking you ll be unsuccessful and that you do not deserve it . he gave examples, ...not completing hours on ti ame was asking to be fired, missing meetings, coming in late. these are all self destructive acts. he is all in all supportive. he said hi am and the team likes me and that occasionally i wi will produce good work which is why have not been fired. i realised that i have been self destructive not only at work but also at home. question if anyone, even in an inti amate setting eg. home with gf therapist , asks me do you want to get fired, or do you want to not graduate. i could not logically conceive, even as the best devil is advocate, any reason to be self destructive. but then my actions say otherwise. i feel that unconsciously i feel that i am worthless, though in a conversation that idea would not even come to my head. this really bothers me because i can self reflect fairly well. but i wouldn t be able to begin describe why in the moment i chose to do those things that i know wi will end up hurting me. i feel that this may be a common enough trait, that i do not think i am alone here. but i would love to read other people is views on my or their situations for this. p.s. i really resonated with this comment https www.reddit.com r raisedbynarcissists comments esueu anyone else feel worthless after making a si ample e rc x ?utm source share amp utm medium web x , which then inspired me to reach out here. tl dr do not think i am worthless. can not i amagine a reason why i would think i am worthless, but a lot of my actions are self destructive and highly point towards that i, unconsciously think i am worthless. and sadly, my actions do speak louder than my intent words .	not depression

love. love. some other bullshit i wrote. love is nothing less but a pain in the ass. i mean this to the full extent. beauty is nothing but a pain in the ass either. nor is being ugly. being beautiful and ugly can go hand in hand. being in love falls in the same place. love is rage. rage can be love. love is life. and you can experience all these things at same ti ame. it is confusing. it is mind draining. it is beautiful and full of hate all at once, when your heart is broken. being ugly does not deal with your appearance. it is all about who you are. we are all ugly. we are all beautiful. we are all thisappointing. we all are wonderful. but what you do with it matters. i personally can not help but be ugly. i can not stop it. but neither can the person i want to be beautiful the most. the person you want to help the most is the most horrible person. that is why you love them. that is why you want to help them and to fix them. they can not be fixed. could you though? they do not accept help, but you can. this is for my daughter. someone i most desperately want to save from an ugly, beautiful person. my heart is torn and my mind is being ruined. i find myself slip away until i see them both. i only then, remember love. i remember a love i wi will always have. a love i should not have, but sti will do. wanting to protect them is natural. wanting to protect yourself is natural. the problem? you can only pick one. after picking one, you sti will do not win. you live with it. no matter how painful this is, you can not give up. do not give anyone that power. nobody deserves power over you. but you should never place your heart and give away someone else is at the same ti ame. pick your real love. pick yourself. pick your child. your family. but never place your feelings into something else just because you feel over and out. put your heart where it belongs and figure yourself out. first and foremost, love yourself, love your family. and do not let anyone get to you because you are alone. let them earn it. you earned love for yourself. do not let strangers pretend to earn their way. ti ame is on your side. and you deserve the best. stop yourself from desperate pleas for attention. find yourself. love yourself. love the people that matter. do not look for something that is not real. for my daughter, for myself, for my stupid, beautiful ex.	not depression

becoming independent lately i have been very depressed about the idea of becoming independent and growing to be an adult. i am and i am suppose to gradate this year, but never have this feeling of anxiousness and fear not dwell on me. growing up i was very sheltered and ti will this day i sti will consider myself sheltered. i have never really gone out and seen the world, i have only been informed of the dangers by my mom because luckily she got to see it herself. and while i am so pleased that i was told about those dangers unlike some people who have been sheltered, it feels as though i can not entirely accept that fact. i am a very sensitive person and i dont even know how to defend myself. throughout my years of schooling, i have always been bullied and too afraid to defend myself, i do not know where this trait of mine came from because i consider both of my parents to be very guarded and defensive. i hate the fact that i have not developed that side to me. another thing about me is that i am almost like a baby inside. can not handle too much pressure. at home i act like a little kid but once i step foot into the outdoors, there is like this mask that comes upon me out of nowhere, and i feel as though i have to behave as this sophisticated being. idk how to act like myself in public. i am always hiding my true feelings because i am afraid of judgment. the person that people have perceived me to be is not at all how i perceive myself. i am not defensive, i am not assertive, and i do not even know who i am. i am a sensitive child inside who on the outside is looked to be something i am not. and i honestly hate it. today i asked a woman if i could borrow her phone and she gave me a rude stare, as though she was thisgusted with me and my overall presence. on the outside i looked like i could not care less that she behaved that way towards me, but in reality i was going to cry my eyes out. little things really hurt me and it sucks that i am that way. i really wish i was this bold person who could handle a kick in the ass,but i can not handle anything and it makes me worry to death about the future. i have been very depressed about the idea of being on my own and getting out into the real world, because this world is so cruel and i do not think i could possibly handle it. i feel like i am too sensitive in this world and everyone runs over me. people tell me i am independent. and of course that is because of my reputation of being an introvert. i like being alone but some if it has to si amply do with not being judged or hurt, or not being accepted or whatever but i wi will say this now. i am not independent and that is just the truth. i thought i was independent all these years but i feel as though i am not. i can barley shop without freaking out because i am so worried about what other people think of me. i can hardly order food alone. talking on the phone and making i amportant calls is an issue for me. i am so tired of people assuming i am just this serious person who has their shit together because honestly that aint even me. i am just a child inside. idk what this is but i guess you can call it a vent of mine. i am sorry this is so unnecessarily long and all over the damn place.	not depression

getting my life back together... slowly i am . i think it is safe to say i have been through a lot, i have trauma related issues, depression, all that fun stuff. anyways my current living situation sucks. i currently pursuing an out a temporary group home that ll help me get back on my feet . it is been a hellish year. last summer i lost one of my ccockatiels a day before my birthday even and i do not mean he died... i mean the person i trusted them with made the dumb decision of letting them out near an open window. i never saw hi am again and i moved away. he was only a baby. from there i complete shut down, he was my best friend and my other tiel is mate. i fell completely out of line with self care and hygiene, i was going through the motions in therapy, and my uncle was giving me adderall everyday. i was barely eating. my diet was entirely addy, energy drinks and the occasional hamburger. so that was my life for like a year. i got out every now and then but mostly i was inside playing games and abusing drugs. not very fun... then i moved out to my mom and stepdad s, did not really want to, but i figured it might be nice to get a fresh start. it started off nice at least. but my step dad is an alcoholic, it is so bad that on the occasions where he makes food you can smell it in the food. i can also smell it when he is halfway across the house. he constantly calls my mom a cunt, a slut, every name in the book pretty much. and then there is my biggest personal insecurity... my teeth. my own complacency has cost me them and i need to have some work done eventually. and we ll i guess things are looking up? i have a counselor now. i have a social worker who is helping me out with services and such. right now i am just searching for something better than this, i feel like i am growing more and more determined to not let myself become a nothing. and i always forget, i am only .. rant	not depression

an interesting title. not really sure why i am posting. i am pretty sure this is my first post. i guess this is about depression. specifically my own. my mind is a mi willion and it is so very difficult to quiet something like that down. my own past is rough and i look for this person that wi will fi will a huge void. i feel like i am always trying to look for someone that is going to fi will this lack of love and void in my life. i keep talking to friends and women that may have an interest in me and could be someone i spend a lifeti ame with after my divorce,but i can not becuase i am with someone already. it is complicated,but everyone judges and says either stick with what you have or get rid of what you have and see what happens. basically my mind thinks while i talk. i have really high highs and very low lows. i am stuck and my daughter is the only thing i know for certain. i see a therapist next month,but i am opti amistic and pretty sure i wi will just be told to stop talking to these women that i have made friends with and shared feelings with and just focus on my own self and my kid,but i do not have a life. i have zero family apart from a grandmother that helps. i just want to feel the love from a person that is attracted to my physical being as well as my insane mind. i have tried three ti ames to find this person and even married one,but they all end in letting themselves go and losing what they wanted to do in life. it is hard to lift myself up let alone another person world.... this is a shitty post. ignore or delete it. sorry for the grammar. i have never been very great at it.	not depression

i wish i could start over i think that i take up so much space so i make myself as mini amal as possible because any aspect of me could be a potential nuisance to someone else, but now i do not even feel like a person anymore	not depression
just need to say it somewhere. i am so done with things. done with life. done with my marriage, she does not care or need me anyway. just done with trying and feeling like anyone gives a damn. it is more painful to have hope than to be confident in the fact that i am alone and always wi will be. maybe the anger wi will come back. i miss the anger.	not depression
suddenly i am emotionally numb and physically exhausted just few days ago, i cried and just wanted to tear myself apart because of a mess of emotions. now it is over but i am exhausted. why? i should feel better when i am emotionally okay. but it feels like my body would give up any second now.	not depression
how to deal with parental narcissism as an adult? my dad is job has been taking a toll on hi am, but i just feel completely absent from hi am. i am failing college classes because of the ways i am being treated. my brother and sister had an easier ti ame with this than me because of moving out and stuff, but i just feel completely lost. i know i have more to live for and stuff, but i just hate how my dad makes me so uneasy and anxious. i feel like one day he is going to snap because i try my best to not let hi am go into my business and look at my phone because even at the age of he thinks he can control every aspect of my life. the only way i can get away from hi am is if i hide in my room or i am out with friends once in a blue moon. i just hate this college anxiety, parent anxiety, and severe depression that comes from it. half of me wants to think he did it for the better of me, and the other half saying he was emotionally absent completely. he supported me in school programs growing up, but that never really helped me mentally. i hope things get better.	not depression
depression that manifests as rage... how did you gain control and what helps? hi guys, i have never posted or shared anything like this before... but i believe i may suffer from bouts of depression rage thisorder that comes and goes. i have never been diagnosed officially as i have never really been to a mental health expert but i am having an issue with my depression manifesting as rage constantly and want to really just open up about it to see if anybody can relate. more i amportantly i just want some advice on how you control it and what has helped you? today i had a rage attack in my car on my lunch break at work. i got triggered from a phone call from somebody customer service associate dealing with my car insurance and i just snapped... i just screamed and cried on the phone cursing and berating the person and hung up and then i ammediately called my boyfriend uncontrollably screaming and crying in my car when i finally yelled the words i just want to fucking hurt somebody. i do not really feel the need to hurt others it is only in these rage attacks fueled by my depression that comes back to haunt me every month or so. my rage has caused me to black out. i have bashed my fists into the wall making my knuckles bleed. have banged my head against the wall, clawed at my skin, ripped my hair out. i used to stab my mattress with a knife but i have tried to make progress on my own and stopped self harm actions completely... my boyfriend is very supportive and we acknowledge my issues when i start going back into depression... lately i think the anger has been resurfacing because i just feel like there is no god. that i am an ani amal for slaughter. i used to be spiritual but i just ruminate on my own death every day and think about how nothing matters. and it makes me angry. black out angry where i become a toxic person. i become a verbally abusive, screaming, uncontrollable person. and it leads me to very dark places where my mind loses control. i am angry at everyone and every thing and it feels like i can not get myself back followed by deep shame when i have an outburst. how do i gain control? or start to gain more control? i want to be a calmer person. i feel as if i make progress and i would not have a rage attack for about a month and then i give in and just lose it completely. like something just ticks and goes off in my head and i completely just want to lose it. any advice is helpful, thanks guys.	not depression

ive been feeling like shit so i wrote a poem. its called some people are like glass some people are like glass, exquisit, beautiful and delicate, they fall and they shatter, sharp fractures of who they once were scattered on the floor some people try to fix them, pick up their shards, they are met by sharp edges, cuts their fingers until the remnants slips from their grasp some people do not give up, they watch the pieces fall, splintering as they try again, until all that is left is dust.	not depression

i wish my parents could not love me i am a failure. at i sti will have not finished university, i feel i did not undestand anything and that i do not have the ski wills or intelligence to make it in life. i only cause my parents and family problems and make them spend money. the worst thing is that my parents are the best parents in the world and they absolutely love me with all their hearts, the always gave me everything. it ki wills me to know i had everything to make myself an usefull human being a lot of money, amazing loving supportive family, good education, good heath, so many chances... i feel i wasted all that and someone more deserving than me should have gotten those things, someone who could make their family proud. i just do not want to be here anymore, i feel so defeated. i wish my parents would show anger and thissapoinment in me, but over and over they just shower me with love and support. i do not deserve these, i have nothing to gave back, i only cause trouble. i have tried so hard for so long to change, but i can only hope to cease to exist. i do not deserve such blessings.	not depression

life is excruciatingly beautiful i have finally realized that no matter how hard i try, i wi will never experience the intensity of pleasure that is possible on drugs anywhere else. this realization brings about a sense of isolation, hopelessness, and futility. why do we all keep enduring such intense pain and doing things we do not like doing just to go on living that is continuing to do things we do not like doing?!? i would rather have an extremely short hedonistic life fi willed with what i like doing than a long life spent in an entirely miserable and bland existence. it gets to a point where you see the dead and lifeless masks we call humanity as dark creatures that devour everything in their path in hopes of fi willing the void within by any means even forcing each other to drag ourselves through this hellish realm because we re too selfish to endure the loss and unreality of our so called stable amp civilized world. i do not know who, why, where, when, or how i am. neither do you. the linguistic models we place in reality are nothing but sign posts leading the way merely angelic whispers cast upon the brisk night of the cosmos.	not depression

my dad is on a business trip and my mom just told me she is filing for divorce. i really need some help processing this. so yeah, my mom dropped this on me last night while out at dinner. i am having a hard ti ame processing it. i am m and due to some personal stuff from , i have been living at home since. my family is small, it is just me, my mom, and my dad. i am an only child. my moms sister and parents live close by and i rarely see my dads family because they are up in new england. the thought of this complete change in the dynamic of my family is honestly scary. last night, with the assistance of my aunt, my mom told me that on friday, she is moving out and into a new house not too far away that she has decided to start renting. apparently for the past weeks she has been slowly moving some of her things in. she plans to do inform my dad that she is filing for divorce via a letter on the counter this is what she was told to do by her attorney, from what i understand she was not even supposed to tell me . he gets home noon on saturday, and i am the one who is supposed to be picking hi am up. this is what is honestly destroying me the most. he has no idea what is about to hit hi am and i do. my mom begged me not to tell hi am and i sti will have not. i just do not know what i am supposed to do knowing what he has waiting for hi am at home. he is not going to take it well. he is catholic and tends to hold onto some of the traditional ways. i know it is going to really hurt hi am and it is hard to just watch from the sidelines. i seriously do not know how to best handle this situation. i have become sort of isolated from my old friends since moving back home and i do not really have anyone to talk to anymore. i was just about to reapply for college and finish my degree but now, i have no idea what the next months looks like for me. their marriage i can not really remember the last ti ame they were happy. they do not hate each other but there is always tension. it is to the point where they both just assume the other is in a bad mood which leads to a perpetual bad mood that never gets better. my mom definitely has some issues she needs to work out as far as anxiety and all that goes. my dad seems like he is been depressed forever now and has always talked about how he would love to transfer his job up north somewhere but never considered it because of my moms job and the fact we have kinda settled here. overall, a very complacent relationship. my dad is pretty traditional so divorce has always seemed taboo. my mom stayed with my aunt last night because i preferred to be by myself last night but she is coming back home tonight and we wi will probably talk about things. i do not know how to express that i am angry with how she handled this. i always been bad at expressing my emotions especially if it wi will upset someone else. i do not ever want anything to come between myself and my parents. they are the most i amportant people in my life, they are all i have really got. what scares me is that if my mom does end up making me essentially be the one to tell hi am, that wi will cause irreparable damage. there is obviously a lot more i could add to this but i am having a hard ti ame putting this post together as it is so feel free to ask questions. any help is greatly appreciated.	not depression

spouse struggling with depression and i am completely lost my wife has been dealing with depression and anxiety for as long as i have known her years in august . last year she started getting more help with this and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. they started her on some medication which has helped... but she really started spiraling late last year. she went from working a full ti ame job, progressing in her career, and being involved with our family and dogs, to drinking heavily, which led to becoming alcoholic, and now she is on fmla to get it all under control. the alcohol part has gotten better, but between doing treatment at a facility and attending aa plus her medication, she is completely wiped of energy every day. i am trying to help and be supportive, but i am also holding down my own work and all the financed to keep us going so i am pretty wiped too. a lot of her identity was tied to her job, so it is really a struggle for her without it, but there is no way she could go back right now and do anything with these energy levels. fmla wi will run out soon, and i doubt she wi will be in any state to go back by then, but i do not know what else to do. we have talked about her just quiting, but it is a great job otherwise with great benefits and pay, and again it is really tied to her identity. i think the freedom from not working would be great until she is got a better handle on the depression and anxiety, but how of i even start to say that? i am really worried she would just spiral.worse without something to do or some other purpose. we have tried exercise, getting outdoors, games, crafts, and other stuff to find hobbies that might call to her, but nothing really fi wills that job shaped void so far. we re only . we have vacations and events planned months out, but i can not see us doing any of them. we have only told her side of the family. they are supportive and try to help, but they live on the east coast and we re on the west so there is only so much they can do. no one on my side of the family or any of our friends know really. i feel guilty wanting to tell folks to explain why i am flaking out on them or not participating, but i have this whole other thing going on in secret, and her needs come before them. i have zero experience with any of this. i keep hoping there wi will be some guidance counselor or advisor to come in and explain what the actual real difference is between leave vs thisability, and who else we should be seeing or talking to, and what a realistic ti ame table is for any of this, and in general how to get my wife back. maybe she wi will never be back to , but i sti will love her, and it is tearing me apart not knowing how to help her. aa folks say the family has to be able to go on in their own life and not be dragged down by the person is addiction, but with depression and anxiety, i am scared to death of what would happen if i am not there supporting her every day. none of this is her fault. she is trying really hard every single day. we re both very detailed people who like to plan ahead, so the ambiguity of it all is driving us nuts. like some days we might go to the mall, do a workout, play with the dogs, and make dinner together like nothing ever happened. some days we may not leave the bed and just watch gilmore girls while eating only peta bread. there is no rhyme or reason. i am really sorry for all of this wall of text, but i think it at least helps me to say write it just to vent. if you made it this far, thanks! good luck to everyone. you matter.	not depression
how do i f apologize and make it up to this guy m for treating hi am badly for no reason? so i have known this guy going on two years. when we hung out we usually drove around and talked or just listened to music. we did have oral sex occasionally. i had not seen hi am for months so like a week or two ago i texted hi am and asked hi am what he was up to. he told me he was at a hotel for work three hours away. i went up there and we ended up having sex. a few days ago i went to his house to hangout and i ended up falling asleep for close to hours on his bed instead of hanging out with hi am. when i woke up he asked me if i wanted to go out for dinner and i told hi am i was not feeling well and went home. last night he offered to take me out for dinner. i did not want to go but i decided to anyway. when we got to the restaurant i told hi am i did not want anything to eat and i basically just sat there and watched hi am eat while i drank soda and played on my phone. i do not like eating in front of people or going inside restaurants to eat which is why i did not eat. plus i just was not in the mood to hangout and wanted to go home. when i said bye to hi am i just gave hi am a quick hug and he leaned down to kiss me but i walked away. we usually kiss when greeting and saying goodbye to each other. i really like hi am a lot but i just feel like i ruined everything. we are both in our twenties. what should i do? tl dr treated a guy i like poorly and i want to make it up to hi am	not depression

exercise for self harm i ampulses recently i tried using exercise to deal with self harm i ampulses. i think it is helped. because exercise works, by creating small tears in your muscles and they heal and that is what makes you stronger. so it can feel a bit like a more productive use of the i ampulse to harm yourself because you are literally pushing and tearing your body, but it is less harmful, plus even a tiny bit of endorphins can help. has anyone else done this? does it work for you?	not depression

some of my perspectives on depression i have spent a decent amount of ti ame on here reading posts and also a good amount of my life depressed. i wanted to share some of my observations on depression that i do not hear about too often. a vicious cycles of depression many of us know depression as a cycle that feeds on itself as sustenance. if we re depressed because we re lonely that depression also makes it more likely that we avoid social interaction making us more lonely making us more depressed and so forth compounding onto itself. you may find this to be very devastating but i believe knowing depression as a cycle can be useful if the psyche is ready to step out of the cycle. cycles are like false traps, to explain this idea i want you too understand cycles in other things in life. all life is cyclical and all cycles sustain themselves by repeating the cycle. one example is the water cycle where water evaporates by heat into the atmosphere until it cools and collects until to fall back down as rain. i suggest you think about other cycles because this may help your understanding of cycles. the interesting thing about cycles is that they can not sustain themselves in and of themselves. all cycles have some kind of mysterious force or energy that kicks starts and then sustains them. in the case of the water cycle it is the heat generated by the sun. so there is an interesting paradox here that applies to the cycle of depression. even though the cycle seems perpetual like a never ending dark night or you feel trapped in the cycle of depression that seems endless there does not exist any cycle in life or of life that is able to sustain itself in and of itself. there is always something mysterious something beyond fueling it. if this source energy could be located and eli aminated it would also end the cycle. tl dr cycles are not internally sustainable such as the cycle of depression. if one could be successful in determining the external energy fueling the cycle the cycle can thiscontinue. if a did not work then continue to b b all sources to cycles are ulti amately mysterious if a did not work for you you have got other problems. someti ames we can locate the source and transcend the cycle, someti ames not. if you are reading this then you tried to locate the source of your depression. what happens is that you may find a potential source but upon further inspection of that source it itself revealed itself as another cycle a bigger cycle or a more complex cycle and now you nonetheless hopelessly find yourself back where you started or in an even bigger mess of cycles. to i willustrate this picture we can talk about the water cycle. we know the water cycle is powered by the heat of the sun. the heat of the sun is due to none other than the nuclear fusion cycle. if we were to inspect more closely the nuclear fusion cycle we would also see that this cycle is also created by other cycles. so we see here that all sources to cycles are cycles so cycles are cycling themselves. this is contradicting a is not it? i did say this was paradoxical. in this state advice or knowledge is not going to help you anymore because you re actually trapped in the cycle of knowledge, if you made this your profession you d be called an epistemological philosopher. realize the reality of this code of language is knowledge it is the very poison that is feeding your cycle of knowledge you are trapped in. period. what do you do? idk god help you. depression as a deeply personal thing many of us know depression is very personal but i do not mean personal as in my private parts are personal. i mean personal as in for each of us it is very much our own and no two is it the same. a burden for most of us to carry at ti ames but deeply ours. we experience this when we try to explain our depression or seek understanding or empathy we may often find the people we explain it to do not quite understand where we are coming from or may even degrade you making you feel worse than had you just kept it to yourself. can you remember a ti ame perhaps before you were depressed wouldn t it have been extremely difficult to understand depression in that state? or maybe your memory is really fucked well consider this. i amagine going to a chinese guy and explaining si ample instructions in english, he just does not speak your language man. or consider birds after a major financial crash and recession every other wallstreet wolf is jumping off a building but the pigeons do not give a shit they wi will happily peck away at your succulent corpse. my point is that the world is not depressing you re depressing. you re this package of depression like a hard drive with gbs worth of depression. some may find this to be a continuous struggle but i offer the opposite perspective. everything in your life since your birth up until this point has made you depressed in exactly the way you are depressed right now down to the most minute of details. well, at worse a terrible life or at best a kind of sathistic trip. if you re a higher functioning depressive you may find this perspective useful, because you might be more capable of taking on your depression. is it possible to be happily depressed? to in a way own your depression as a signature or birthmark? like bitch please even if i am orgasming i am sti will like ki will me please because that is my truest self. tl dr depression is not just a phase i am going through dad, it is my lifestyle what if i am really fucking depressed and about to ki will myself for real at lot of people in the past have done it many more wi will do it in the future. bet you did not think i would say that. that is just the truth it seems you want to know the truth. they say when you die you get to find out what life is all about so basically the truth right? well maybe that is you, let us just say it is. many people have ki willed themselves for all types of reasons. some did it accidentally they just fucked up once oops and they died for it blood on their own clumsy ass hands and feet. some because they were seriously fucked deep in enemy territory maybe tortured for weeks months starved and at the brink of death, they thought lets just get this over with. some because they just said life is not for me or shit has changed i am done with this crap to hell with it. some because of anger like i wi will show those asshats when they find my corpse they wi will know what is up. some in glory like those guys that went into the nuclear reactor they knew they were going to die. they saw purpose beyond their flesh and bones a legacy beyond their conscious life. for all of us our destiny is death, and for a small minority of us it wi will be directly connected to our own actions. but here is a shower though do not we all die indirectly because of our actions and is not that indirect suicide? sure you did not know or sure it was not my fault i got cancer or it was not me who choose to be born and now subject to the destiny of dying but you re like that baby screaming away after it is been shot out of the cannon straight into a wall of spikes. i mean it is already too late you re donezo kid. you were finished the moment you were born and so was i. dead but alive another paradox for you, i know someone out there likes these. but here is the thing, before you pull that trigger, really how dead seriously sure are you that your destiny lies in lead? or in pi wills or underwater or hanging from a tree? that is all on you homie. ki willing yourself is like quitting. fuck quitters, quitters go to hell i am saying this because we human is have a serious thing against quitting. and rightfully so but maybe not in the reasons you may expect. to explain i want to talk about evolution. probably none of you are into bush crafting but i am sure you have all seen bear grylls drink his own piss, so you should know how motherf dollars king hard it is to survive the old fashion way. however, we humans have done that for way way longer than we have been jerking off at our screens. at a very very deep level us humans were selected by nature to perform and survive or die. after many many generations of this we have you and me in the year . so you can i amagine why we hate quitting and therefore hate quitters. in the wild you could not quit, you could not take a depression day to cry and eat pizza and snuggle with your body pi willow. you had to be on and ready for anything. always planing ahead, preparing for the night, preparing food, fixing tools, etc. etc. in the modern day we call this studying for exams, practicing your arts, investing for the future, work hard and working smart, insert any tony robbins quote , etc. etc. we put a ton of value on these things because we re in it and do not realize it. i do not mean to knock on it but to show that it can be seen as a game. life as a game, as something not totally dead serious, and as with all games intended for us to have fun. ok i am tired you re probably tired too getting to here sorry for the typos and grammar stuff no i am not going to ki will myself, please leave me alone.	not depression

i just cut ties with my only friend yeah. the title basically says it. i would been mulling over this for at least a few months now, ever since she told me she cheated on her boyfriend of over a year. that might seem insignifican not but she was around when i was cheated on and she got to see how emotionally broken i was afterwards, even up to this day. she saw me go from a sad, but relatively normal person into the paranoid, emotionally broken mess that i am nowadays. i wish i could explain it in a way that everyone reading this would understand it but i just can not really put into short enough sentences the way it changed the course of my life and my emotional development after it happened. she saw the way that it ruined me as a person and how it ruined the way that interpersonal relationships are formed for me now. i think what i am trying to say by pointing that out is that she saw the way it fucked up her friend, and it astonishes me that she so happily did it to her own partner. but yeah. he never found out and with my exit from their lives i do not think he ever wi will. i saw too much of myself in hi am after i found out what she did to hi am that i could not spend the ti ame around hi am without crying the same night. after i found out, it brought all the same nightmares back that had been slowly slowing down. he is in the same position i was in and he would probably react the same way too, and i just can not be the one who does that to a person. i can not be the one who turns his world from an okay one to one where everyone is lying to hi am. i did not say goodbye, i do not see too much to gain out of saying goodbye to her. i finally have my closure from the situation and i do not want to give her closure if she happens to need it. i do not know what i seek to gain out of this post but i feel kind of lost? i have already come to terms with losing her permanently and i am pretty happy to leave her behind now that i have had all this ti ame to think about that and the i amplications behind that, but i do not know where to go from here. do i try to make another friend and hope this new person does not turn out the same? do i instead focus my ti ame towards hobbies and building up my storenvy shop? is it even worth it to try to make another friend right now? i do not feel too excited to try to scout out someone new.	not depression

i hate people so i asked the only other woman i know, how i might best have a chance of rekindling the last hope i have of ever trusting anybody ever again. of course, her answer was the predictable just be friends. it is not like i have forgotten that i am not a catch. or that since i last knew this girl i have had everything taken from me by the most horrendous bitch i ever pretended was not. it is not like i wad hoping she would tell me i had some secret chance to hope life was not just a horrible joke in myself. thanks for confirming that my best chance in happiness is acceptance that the best chance i have in happiness is forgetting about ever being happy. fuck women. you are all shit	not depression
i am having a rough night rant mainly because i can not see my boyfriend. we re currently going through a long thistance relationship and i can not see hi am in person until december. and it is further complicated because i can not afford to go home, and he can not come up here to see me because he is busy taking care of his stepfather and his parents do not know we re gay. i hate not being with hi am so much. we talk occasionally but it feels like he is so thistant and does not want to be with me. i get that he is busy and way more antisocial than i am but i hate it so much. before we started dating i used to be in a very dark place. i was closed off from the world and everyone else around me until i met hi am. i wouldn t talk to anyone and i had no idea why. i was just constantly depressed. i later found out that i had depression and anxiety severely, and it had been inherited from my mom i did not know that was a thing . it did not help that my mom was one of the stricter kinds, and forced me to close myself off from friends for whatever reason at a very young age. she is gotten a lot more accepting since then, and i love her to pieces. i am getting off track. anyways, i always felt at peace when i was with my boyfriend, and i love hi am so much for that. he helped me out of a very dark place and i can not thank hi am enough. but after tonight i just miss hi am so much that it feels like i am in that dark place again and i hate it. i wi will occasionally feel like this but it goes away after a bit. but this ti ame it is different. i had just gotten off the phone with hi am and i just felt so bad. nothing went wrong with the conversation or anything like that. i just had not heard his voice in so long that i missed hi am so much. i hate feeling like this. tonight was the first night in a long while that i actually cried over something.	not depression
as expected do not feel like crying on my birthday today but i guess i am unhappy.	not depression
wi will it actually help? since around nd grade i have not the ideal happy kid. in rd and th grade i would have random crying fits that i had no reason for. in th grade, not a lot of people liked me, and throughout middle school i was mostly shunned for being the weird kid. the only reason why i had a friend group by that point is because my best friend since nd grade introduced me to his friends throughout the years. now, i am in th grade, and things have only gotten worse. the summer between th and th grade i started drinking and hit a low point in december where i attempted suicide. afterwards, things got better for a little bit. i felt better, more confident, and even got a girlfriend. i stopped drinking for the most part and had fun for a while. taylor cheated on me and i got back to drinking. that brings us to now. i do not have my license and i am . i am addicted to alcohol and regularly smoke cigarettes, and i have been trying to pull through by telling myself that when high school ends, i wi will be free. wi will graduation be the light at the end of the tunnel?	not depression
how the hell do i already feel the way i do? it is kind of strange. nowadays, when i look at myself, i can not see anything good about me at all. everything people say about me just seems hollow, but i also know that my negative thoughts are mostly just anxiety speaking. so when i empty out those anxious thoughts of how awful i am, all i get is nothing. kind of like i see a statue instead of myself. i have been hit by heartbreak, low self esteem, attempted suicide, you name it. no doubt, as i am a teenager, all of those feelings just keep getting amplified. but in ti ames like this, when the storm is decided to go away for a while, i just see nothing there. nothing of merit, but nothing to thisdain. nothing useful, but nothing detri amental. like my worth as a human is dead set on zero, and that i just possess no real traits, good or bad. it is false, and to some extent i realize that, but i si amply can not point out any trait about myself anymore. maybe it is just a si willy thing caused by anxiety. i do not really know. sucks, though.	not depression
how do i force myself to make fucking friends it seems like no matter how lonely i find myself my brain can not seem to muster up the smallest interest in making friends. i just hate talking. i have no interest in other people. i feel like i am missing out on so much stuff because my brain does not want invest emotionally into people. what the fuck do i do.	not depression
thisorientation and sickness from depression it is been a rough week for me. i have been in a pit all week and i have felt exhausted and physically weak for days and today i have started having dizzy spells and light nausea. it feels like there is a pressure in my head and my ears feel like they need to be popped but nothing clears it. does anyone else experience this or is it something i should look into? i have spoken to a doctor about some of the symptoms but they say it should pass.	not depression
has anyone who posted on here actually commited suicide? i am obviously not talking to the people who have ki willed themselves as they arent around to respond but out of the thousands of suicidal post ive read on on here its scary to think that some of these people that posted on here actually have went through with it and ki willed themselves whether it was year ago, months ago or even last week. the fact that their post is sti will up and their probably dead is bone chi willing.	not depression
something i wrote after reflecting for a bit. i am learning a lot about myself all the ti ame. this ti ame has forced me to reflect even more again. i am... unhappy. my life is unhappy. i have had dysthymia since . since i recovered from depression, i have not been okay or normal since. i have had periods of normality, and those were bliss. but they did not last long. and they were only due to the fact that i took antidepressants. the real ones and my kind love and affection from a partner. those antidepressants helped me cope with all the unhappiness i had within me. they balanced everything out and made everything okay. things were sti will miserable, but i had them to keep me afloat. but when they are no longer in my system, things turn back to shit because i have lost my only source of support and sanity. and that is something i am trying to figure out how to change, or at least how to cope with. but it is insanely difficult. mindfulness takes so much effort. trying so hard to just make yourself okay and to be normal takes so much effort. it does not make sense. i can not commit to the amount of effort, which in itself sets me up for failure already. i am thankful that i have become clearer than ever about this big part of me. but i am sti will clueless as to how to go about fixing myself. i do not have the ti ame, nor the motivation, nor the resilience. and i can not just psych myself up and say that i do and do it anyway. it is going to be a tough journey of trying, failing, and trying again. little steps.. little changes.. maybe someday i wi will make it out.	not depression
i dont know can not tell if this is the right place for this but whatever. i try to be better over and over but i dont think i am making worthwile progress. people who care about me piss me off because their faults reflect mine. i dont do any of my schoolwork and i dont seem to care about anything besides instant gratification. i base my value on all these things but i dont feel like i am worth fixing so i dont want to try anymore. i make excuses every day to stop myself from living. the hours slip away and i am left empty as always. i feel like the years wi will do the same and at the end of my life i wi will regret living at all. i listen to music to make myself feel better every night because i am a failure every day. i could just be using that ti ame to make my life better but i sit around and continue to be worthless. i continually thisappoint everyone. i feel like my whole life is fabricated because no one is really honest with themselves, it makes me think theres no hope for me to be either. i want to just be me, i dont feel like putting on the thisguise amymore, but i will never stop because its the easy path. when a man lies he murders some part of the world, these are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives. all this i can not bear to witness any longer, can not the kingdom of salvation take me home? please be honest with me, i am tired of the bullshit. i would like to especially request tough love. theres been no strong influence on my life telling me i need to be better, and so i havent. sorry	not depression

so, my friend left. i am not really looking for anything in posting this here, i guess. just throwing my thoughts to the breeze. there is a social forum i like to hang around on each day. i make friends there, talk about whatever our lives, about whatever is in the news, about nothing, about each other. i had a friend there who i wi will call jane, who would mostly just post lighthearted stuff, but she would come onto anyone is post when they were hurting and offer condolences and try to make them feel better. we would have nice little chats and play around the drama on the website. well, last december, after i would known her for like a year, she posted a thread that kinda indicated that she was not feeling well. i do not remember the details, but i sent her a message asking her how she was doing. she said she does not open up to people, and... i was kind of worried, so i pressed the issue. apparently, jane had been habitually bullied and bitched at by another user on the site when she was like ish years ago , to the point where it wrecked her mood all of the ti ame. that user had just returned a few days ago. due to the ti ame lapse, basically nobody remembered her except for jane, and both of them pretended as though nothing had happened. the former bully kinda started attention whoring she would post a quadri willion selfies and cute posts to get responses. jane was bothered by the way everyone kind of just accepted the ex bully it hurt to see someone who d caused her all this pain get praised to high heavens. so i told her i would stand by her if anything happened and otherwise comforted her to the best of my ability. and i stopped being nice to the girl she would been talking about. jane had asked me not to mention the old feud because that would cause drama, which i certainly understood and rolled with. that all was just the prelude though, to the real subject of this post. a couple of days ago, she posted something like, i can not do this anymore. like, a real sunnyd type of situation. so i sent her a message asking if she was alright. her responses were... a string if deeply pained emotions just oozing out of her head. she said she was leaving the site, wanted to hurt herself, kinda i amplied that she might ki will herself. i spent a few minutes trying to get her to talk to me about what it was that was bothering her, because she did not want to... jane said she was going to cut herself and i made her promise to use a sterile blade and keep a phone within an arm is reach, which she did. she explained that she was coming up on a year from her mother is death from cancer, and she would had a really great relationship with her up until then. she asked me if she would see her mother if she died, and i told her that she wouldn t. i cried a little when i sent that because it was such a miserable truth that i needed to say. if my friend ki willed herself for that kind of false hope, how fucked up would that have been? i did my best to just acknowledge her suffering and encourage her to let it out. she deactivated and reactivated her account a few ti ames in the span of a few minutes. i got the sense i did not have much more ti ame to make an i ampact. i told her that i hope she gets professional help, and i wi will never forget what she said next. she said she was really embarrassed. she asked me if i thought of her any differently now, and you can probably guess my answer. i cried a little more, knowing that she would repressed her feelings so damn much out of shame. god, why am i writing this? and i told her that she was totally normal for feeling that way, and a psychiatrist would understand in a heartbeat. i think she accepted that answer. she messaged me back a couple more ti ames and then left for good. i hope she is recovering. i hope i might have kinda steered her down the right path.	not depression
i keep losing i do not know how to begin this, and i used to be a great writer. i used to write so often, but slowly that was lost. i once could create songs and pick up any instrument, but the music is gone. i could cook by communicating with food on a spiritual level, and these days i have to force myself to eat. if i felt lonely i would hit up a friend to hangout. nowadays i am too afraid to leave and lack the motivation to socialize. i used to use tinder and other apps to find sexual gratification, even had several fwb, my confidence and sexual prowess was incredible. i am currently in a relationship, and the sex was better than being single, but recently we both lost our sex drive for one another. i do not even find people attractive enough which compel me to want sex. i do not even find myself attractive. i used to take pictures of myself, model for some friends, now i can not wait to leave my sight in a mirror. my job is, on paper, the best stepping stone i could have asked for. i bartended and served while navigating post grad life after losing my career opportunities within my field at . technically, that one was a government issue with lab funding, but i lost hope in my field from that experience. i tried to pursue law, even became a paralegal, but my experience in the legal field brought in first hand forecasting of bad futures. i am working on computer programming and coding right now as a self taught coder, but i have this fear my current job is the one i am stuck with and everything i am doing now is a waste of ti ame. this fear has infected me, this fear of my own worth tied to my job. logically, i can see the flaws in the fear, but...well, hate to swear, but fuck is it heavy... i am losing interest in everything else slowly. i just got out of a mental fog that lasted for an entire year where i just coasted along my existence. i am years old, and i am really just in such a mental hell. i am able for the first ti ame in my adult life able to have professional help, but i feel it is so slow. i have not been happy since my move to nc years ago. i have a job, a lease, a partner, and other things which make an instant move i ampractical right now. we acknowledge this place is not good for us, but i am losing hope in the future. i can not keep losing. i do not want to go back into the fog. i am trapped in a hole of my own creation. i wish i never left richmond. i wish i followed my gut about nc. i wish i kept my family at a thistance. i feel like the argo right now, but without repairs.	not depression
just need some positivity i am brand new here. had a wonderful night with friends tonight, but started new antidepressants a week ago. as soon as they left i began bawling and was very aware how alone i was. i am not alone, i have a great support system which usually works for me. today i feel truly alone. like i can not describe to anyone what i am feeling. not sure what i am asking here. i just needed to share.	not depression
support group perhaps? sup guys , i would like to know if there would any interest in maybe creating a mail thistribution list where some blokes can just mail each other just to get things of their chest maybe get some advice if possible or even just some words of encouragement and if we make a friend or it wi will not hurt things right ? i am a is kid so for me its difficult to talk about these things with my family and friends i was taught to suck it up and take it like a man . as we all know the suicide rate among men are the highest perhaps because we were taught not to talk about our feelings . i do not know, all i know is we need some type of support structure. any case let me know if this would interest you.	not depression

from the beginning i had deluded myself into believing that i do not need anyone by my side. but i know i wi will forever long for what i can not have. i am a bitter misfit, always had been. in the past i had managed to cope by convincing myself i do not need people. even though this delusion had led me to ruin, when i got back up again i sti will believe this. because believing otherwise would make it too painful. in the first place, i am terrified of people. specifically, i am terrified that they wi will despise me once they realize what kind of person i really am. i can never get close to them. i had hurt a lot of people when i tried. somehow it always ended up like i am playing a game with them when i approach them then run away when they approach me back. but i swear it is not intentional, i just can not help it. how can i let people see me when i know with almost certainty that they wi will leave once i start being real? but without being real, i hurt people. i do not know anymore, i have given up on romantic relationships. but i have also hurt friends being this way, but i can not let go of my friends, i have tried that and almost ki willed myself. i wish i was not like this...	not depression

i just need to vent and this is my safe space i just feel like such an obligation to everybody around me, that probably why everyone eventually leaves. it explains why my dad now hates me and why my mom left me for some guy on the opposite side of the country. even my friends and best friends do not feel like such, i do not really have anybody. i even drive away my boyfriend, i love hi am so much, but i just know that i unwi willingly push hi am away. i feel like an obligation to everybody. and my only relief was cutting, but i have been trying really really hard to stop, but it is just getting harder and harder, i just keep visualizing myself doing it and the relief that i feel when it is done. i do not do it to try and die, i do it as a way to relieve myself and to justify all the wrongdoings i cause. i am just so tired of living in this body, fi willed with the constant self hate and need to cut in order to feel ok, i just want all these thoughts to stop. i just want a friend.	not depression
i have so much to do but i can not i work hours a week, have credit hours and put hours a week into an internship a week. i have so much to do, especially with midterms coming up but all i can do is sit here. i have not been to the gym in weeks, i have not slept well in months, no ones checking up on me and i can not even get this shit done. i just stare into space for what feels like hours and then i do not have ti ame to do what i need any more. my body aches, my head is ki willing me and i dont know what to do anymore. i know i have too much on my plate but i can not back out of any of it. i dont know what do.	not depression
big sigh i know i am capable and beautiful. but i also know that these things do not really matter because my existence is just a blip in ti ame like a bi willion other blips. when i fade away, become stardust, whatever, it would not matter who i was because my ti ame wi will have come to an end, as if it never really began. this world is a mad house full of confused children in adult bodies. and none of society really means anything. we re all just making shit up as we go. nobody knows anything. they just think they do.	not depression

should i reveal my insecurities to my girlfriend sorry in advance i am drunk and have nowhere to turn and my thoughts make me want to fuckin end it. i just feel like she is ashamed to be dating me. like she tries her best to keep me compartmentalized from her friend group i have met her best friend maybe ti ames in year of dating . i read her journal i am a piece of shit i know and in one entry she described a past event she hosted where i was not originally invited, and some of her friends wanted to bring their sos so she eventually invited me too so i wouldn t feel bad, i am sorry but i do not want hi am to come . i think i am good at communicating issues usually but i am afraid of this one. my idea of a relationship is to be with a friend who i can introduce to my friend group and we can all be comfortable around each other, but clearly that is not hers we do not live together if that makes a difference . and to be honest that whole thing bothers the shit out of me but what is there to even do about it. and everywhere i read on reddit other men post about their regrets about revealing their insecurities to their girlfriends, and how that makes them lose attraction or whatever. i am sure you have seen what i am talking about it is common on askmen. anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far. i really needed to just vent because i feel like shit. you do not have to reply or give advice but i wi will appreciate any if you do. and to everyone reading, please take care of yourselves. ki wills me to know how many others feel this way. but i wi will really appreciate any responses, i wi will. sorry if this broke any rules of the subreddit too	not depression
anyone else hate how fast ti ame goes by? day in and day out i just kinda do my functions and mope. i go to classes, study if i need to, i go to work, and i wi will even go out on weekends to parties where i am reminded of how socially inept i am and just how much panic and anxiety that much sti amulus puts in me, and my downti ame is generally just laying on my bed high either napping or on this site. its not a bad routine but its something i have settled into and i guess is more productive than my old high school routine of go to school, get home, grind xbox ti will bed, repeat. now that i am in college, its a fucking blur. and a half years gone by and i have got nothing to show for it but mediocre grades, a failed relationship, and a set of fraternity brother is that wouldn t trust me with screwing in a lightbulb. i am not dumb, but my mind is all over the place in social situations so i guess i do not communicate my ideas well enough. high school was years ago for me. feels like a few months honestly. winter break was or weeks ago, feels like a single week. it worries me. as thiscontent with life as i have been for years, i sti will do not want it to fly by. sure i feel like a husk as a shamble through my routine but i feel as though this experience is better than nothing at all. i do not want to lay on my deathbed and just think i moped my life away before going into that good night. worse, it gets faster. anyone older i have mentioned this too just laughs and says wait ti will you graduate, then ti ame really flies . what the fuck?? why would the human brain perceive ti ame like this? i want to savor life the irony of course being the now and then suicidal thoughts, but i am not going to do it, i just have the thoughts not blast through it thistracted, worried, and anxious all the ti ame. does anyone else worry about this as much as i do?	not depression
what is been on my mind for the past year i never tend to tell anyone whats on my mind but i am feeling particularly down at the moment so i thought i would make a mini rant is that what i should call it? i was diagnosed early last year with depression and of course followed suit with antidepressants and counseling, it was also around the same ti ame that i met my now ex girlfriend whom i truly fell in love with despite the agonising travel thistance i would often bare with for the short ti ame i actually got to spend with her in person. somehow i made it through my final year of school even though the daily challenges i would encounter like getting out of bed or attempting to take my own life. the support i had from friends and family was more then i deserved, however i was constantly worried about becoming a si ample nuisance to them so i rarely told someone how i would been feeling. jump to september and my girlfriends th. as soon i got there i could tell something was wrong, she would been unaffectionate and even others had noticed too, i initially deduced it to her dealing with her own life stressors however i made sure to ask during some downti ame at the party that night when to my surprise she told me she was gay. i really did not take it to well, i cried on the spot however she would wanted no one else to know yet so i had to tell everyone that i would just had to much drink for the night and act like everything was fine. the following two days were even worse, having to put on a straight face for all her friends and family and be the good boyfriend. all that ti ame and even now i never hated her or got mad, i was just upset, upset how i could be dropped from her life so suddenly with no explanation. i never understood how she was just suddenly gay now. she never talked to me about it or attempted to explain and i never asked because i was sure she herself was just as confused about what she was going through. a week later i was finally able to tell everyone that we d broken up and attempted to deal with the countless wow you turned your girlfriend gay? comments. i know of course that is not how it worked but to say i was not embarrassed or that the comments did not get to me was a lie. a month later and i was finally graduating, two hours before it officially started in my full suit, i was in my english teachers office finishing off english work so that i could actually pass all the while dealing with the fact that my nan had been died early randomly that morning. i fucking loved her, nan was one of the three women in my life i attribute to making me the person i am today. however because of this tragic occurrence none of my family made it to my graduation, not that i would blame them of course nor that i really deserved any recognition for the shitty excuse of a pass i was handed. fast forward the whole party events that most graduates attend i did not, i was to broke and depressed everyone has started to leave for further study. most of my friends have moved on while i never made plans for anything of the sought. i feel like a deadbeat, i tried to ki will myself at my friends th three weekends ago, i did not deserve the help i received from the people who found me and rushed me to hospital. i can not believe how selfish i was to ruin people is night like that, i wish i would done it in a more private location. however what really hurt today was seeing a post on facebook about how my ex was now dating a new guy, a friend she would hung out with quite a bit when we were dating. i sti will do not hate her. i am not even jealous, i am just sad, hurt and hating myself. i am just left wondering why i am so wrong, i am sure i wi will get over this in ti ame. ti ame is great for coming to terms with myself. finally after writing this i am not really concerned if anyone truly reads this or not, i would just like to know that it is posted somewhere. if anyone actually does read this i just want you to know that people like me really do care to hear about your own troubles, it feels truly terrible to keep it bottled up and that even telling strangers can make a difference.	not depression

i am so tired of the constant thisappointment this is a throwaway account. i do not expect any response or anything. i just need a place to write down my feelings and maybe just maybe i could get a little bit of hope. i have never really told anyone the full story since, since i have some trust issues. as far as i could remember, i never really had a happy childhood. i basically grew up with my grandparents mom side , while my mom was working jobs to just keep us fed and sending most of the money to my dad. and my dad was never around, since he lived in a different country at the ti ame. i do not think i even have any memories of hi am until i was , when i finally got to lived with hi am. that was mostly due to the fact that my grandparents from my dad is side did not want us i ammigrant there. so when my mom and i finally got the chance to move in with my dad and his parents, it finally felt like a family. but the thing is, my grandparents from my dad is side often verbally abuse my mom and i when my dad is not around. my mom always took the abuse hoping that it would never reach to me, and while my dad had his anger problems, she always protected me from any actual danger. but i always knew, but there was nothing i can do. i felt hopeless, but i thought at least i finally have someone to call dad. i knew he loved us, especially me, but he actions were a bit violent at the same ti ame. my mom fear the worst if she were to go to work, and my dad were to take his anger out on me, so she left me in the care of my grandparents dad is side . between a broken family or an abusive one, i rather have the broken family. because it seemed like my grandparents were so tired of us, they frame my mom for abuse. and i remember waiting for her that night. it was later than ever. i was scared, my mom was gone, and i started crying uncontrollably. i beg my dad multiple ti ames to to call my uncle for help, and he finally gave in. my uncle hired a lawyer got establish an alibi, and my mom was freed. that was the moment, my mom knew there was no where safe for her and i. so she took me and ran in the middle of the night, using whatever little money she had to trade for a flight ticket to anywhere. and that was the last memory i had of my dad. that months was not much, but at least he was there. when i arrived to the new location, my mom had very little income. she was working hard to get herself a job, and start fresh. with little to no money, there were days were all we could afford was cup of rice for the day. and the day my mom finally found a job, we celebrate with a can fish with rice. that was one of the happier meal i shared with her. she continue to work jobs just to provide for us. and then she met a man. i was at the ti ame, and when he started to sexually abuse me, i did everything stay away from hi am. i intentionally get extra weights, try to be around my mom when she was not at work as often as i could when he was around, and when he would try to touch me while i am asleep, i would try to block with my stuff ani amals. i was terrified to be at home. i could not tell my mom since, it seems like for once she was happy, and stable. i did not want to ruined that for her, and so i kept everything to myself. slowly i found myself to be more and more suicidal. but my religion told me that its a sin to ki will myself, and so i kept on breathing. numb, looking for any kind of love or attention. i was isolated without a family or anyone to trust. that lesson was reinforce when i finally made some real friends during those years, or so i though. i thought if we were close enough i could share what was going on in my life. it was just the two of us, i thought i could really call her my best friend lets call her jess . and then she met a new friend lets call her erica , and our little circle got just a little bigger. we had some really good ti ames. they were my escape from home, but slow i felt that jess and erica were excluding me on their hang outs. jess would began to tease me endlessly about my weight and erica just join in on the fun when i was intentionally gaining for self protection . at one point, they would start to wearing matching clothes for parties and event. when i asked them if they had gotten me matching clothes too, and they told me off. i knew they no longer wanted me at their circle. at that point, i had completely given up on them. i would purposely chose a different high school and maybe a new group of friends, and start fresh. fast forward years. i finally feel mature enough to meet with my dad. i wanted to tell hi am how much i have grown. and i just wanted to know how he was doing. i was planning on buying the plane ticket the weekend during my break. and the two days before that, i received a phone call. i was told that he had pass away. i had finally gotten the courage to go and see hi am, but i was already too late. i just wanted to tell hi am that, i missed hi am. and that i loved hi am. and that i was doing okay, and i do well in school, and even thought he was not part of most of my life, i have always remember hi am. i was ready. ready to meet hi am. ready to see hi am, to see how he was doing. and now the last memory of hi am was the one where he was laying in the coffin. why is it that i try so hard to reach out, but results is always so thisappointing? again and again, i am reminded that there is no point in having hope. why do i even bother trying anymore. i am just so tired. i just want it to be over already. if i do not wake up tomorrow, what is there to lose anyways. at least the pain, the thisappointment, the loneliness can finally stop. i am just....so tired.	not depression
i was ok until i was bad again i was okay, not have any depressive episodes, no thought of wanting to ki will myself, and kind of happy. now i am struggling so much. i think about ki willing myself all the ti ame, i can barely get out of bed, and my appetite was gone for weeks and it only returned last week. i have gone through so much shit recently. i isolated myself from my friends and could only go to work. i got rejected by the guy i am in love with and the one i was sleeping with. neither of them wanted to be in a relationship with me and it fucking sucks. my grades in school are suffering. what triggered this was me getting sick and me having to figure out what the fuck i want to do with my life. i was swi amming for awhile, but now i am drowning.	not depression
i am scared for someone is life a friend of mine is really depressed, even suicidal, and tried everything to heal, from talking to a specialist to being hospitalized and taking some sort of medication. but nothing worked and i really do not know what to do to help her. she can not thistract herself from negativity and does not like to do what she used to enjoy anymore. her family is not that supportive or understanding, so she does not have someone to talk with, just two or three friends. to me, it feels i ampossible to help her, because i can not even help myself with what i am going through right now and i am afraid i wi will make everything worse.	not depression

trying to find answers.. please help m i am going to delete this soon.. please give me an outside perspective on this. mostly curious as to what this state of mind is called and just trying to understand why i enjoy it. so lately i have been feeling apathetic, nostalgic, depressed maybe just extremely sad , extremely mellow, and whatever else. i seem to enjoy feeling this way but can not find a reason. i am not an emotional masochist as i dont go out of my way to hurt myself at all but i am just letting life happen to me. i have anxiety and depression so this is not necessarily unusual but the apathy is new. it is like i am romanticizing a mundane and incredibly boring lifestyle. i am not thissatisfied with anything and i am actually extremely opti amistic and what i call a gifted ability to rationalize situations. for example i may be extremely jealous at the fact that the girl i currently have feelings for is smiling with someone else i know blah blah unhealthy but i also know she is her own person and can do whatever she wants with her life and i dont take my anger out on her or anything else which i dont even have of the ti ame , i would say a good way to describe it is intense sonder yes with an s . i think what i enjoy about feeling this way is the very philosophical and introspective edge i get from it. over analyzing every situation, asking myself how people feel, making stories for their lives, fantasizing, and gosh whatever else. it kind of calms me when i am anxious.. so when i am worked up i will just say man no one is thinking of you at all or other variations. uhh back to the girl i mentioned. i had a huge crush on her for the longest but when we finally started talking and after my anxiety is mostly gone i seem to enjoy ti ame away from her more than being with while also getting upset when seeing she has not messaged me. for context we have been acquainted for about a month and she thinks that i am so cool her words i swear lol but after talking for a week or two weeks we ll go a week or days without speaking which is always because she leaves me on seen. also sounds like its online but its not we just dont get the chance to each other often in school due to business, conflicting schedules, and what i assume is mutual thisinterest anxiety. i make music and write and i seem to be at a creative peak mostly inspiration from vampire weekend so that is also a plus....... uhh i am really trying to say everything here so sorry for the somewhat random jumping around. i think about the girl a lot by the way but not just her as i am a total guy and like multiple girls but the others i am attracted to physically. hope i dont sound like an incel or nice guy i am honestly pretty normal said every nice guy ever jk jk i dont take any medication, dont really talk to anyone about this, been this way since the start of the week or maybe two but its been building up this whole month. i hope i was clear about everything and i am just wanting an outside perspective on this i am not looking for ways to feel happy although technically i feel comfortable this way. btw ive felt this alot in these passing years and theyre my favorite ti ames to look back on.. not to relive but i like playing music from said ti ames and being in touch with those feelings someti ames if that makes sense sorry for poor grammar but i just can not be interested lol. thanks for reading and whatever else people say.	not depression
i do not know how to stop hating myself i am currently sitting in the er because of a panic attack brought on by my wife just giving birth to our first child. i have been diagnosed with depression and seen therapists and psychiatrists but the reoccurring issue i have is i hate myself more than anyone can hate me. i know it is i willogical and it does not make sense but i feel like the dumbest, ugliest, worst, loser on the planet and can not understand for the life of me why anyone likes me. i go through cycles of being okay then massively breaking down like today. i thought i would be okay with the child birth stuff and it is not. i am freaking out and just do not know what to do. i just can not i amagine being a father and being like this. i just hate myself for being in this position in the first place	not depression
i do not know what to do i do not know how to describe it. the way it all feels or does not feel it is unsettling. it is like everything at once is just eating away at me from the inside and i know it is not good, but i just do not have the drive to fix it or do anything about it. i want to tell someone but when i talk about it i feel weak. i just dont know what to do anymore besides feel like a burden to my family.	not depression
trying to hang in there i am going to preface this by saying although i think about dying a lot, deep down i do not want to. i want to grow old and live a normal life. i want to provide for and take care of my parents, i want to eventually get married and have children, i want to enjoy life. i feel like like i have been trapped in my mind for so long i never really realized how badly depressed i was. recently just have not been able to contain my emotions. i do not want to get out of bed, i do not want to go to class, i dont want to work, i want to pursue my one of passions but i am losing the motivation to continue. i often find myself fantasizing about what if i was a different person. what if i had different attributes, what if i had the attributes that i want and i was able to be the person i want to be? i increasely find myself looking in the mirror wishing i could change myself and reality but i am stuck here as is. i wish i could have been going to school to become a doctor lawyer engineer but i am not smart enough. i wish i couldve had a fulfi willing relationship in my life but i never have and feel unlovable. i wish growing up kids were nice to me. instead i am in college and sti will dealing with the emotional trauma i have from being heavily bullied. i wish i could go back and unmeet people who did me wrong. i wish i sti will had some people in my life i cared about. i wish my social anxiety would stop flaring up everywhere i go, but i feel everyone i meet hates me. i wish i could meet my own standards for myself, i wish i didnt have the weight of the world on my shoulders. i wish i did not think about dying so much. i know despite coming up short on every goal in my life i sti will have a lot to live for, but at the same ti ame i do not want to. i wish i didnt have these intrusive thoughts. i wish i could tell my darkest secrets to get them off my chest. i wish i could be stronger in faith but i have strayed far from it. i get scared thinking about what i might do to myself if my depression ever gets to a point where i can not handle it. honestly i wish i had a shoulder to cry on but how can i do that when everyone around me themselves are crying and depressed? how can i do that when i struggle to trust and confide in people? i feel like i am losing my sanity and i need to reconnect with reality. i want to stop hating myself and but i have made myself the best version of my self i can be and i am sti will not happy with who i am. i am also very embarrassed about my actions these past few years. i went from being a good little kid to smoking, drinking, and fucking all behind my parents back. i often wonder why i make the decisions i make but i feel like i naturally gravitate towards them, as if i can not stop myself from making bad decisions. i am scared for my future. i want a successful one but i feel my mental health may prevent that. i also constantly feel that my feelings are invalid, as if i am being a pussy. i tried to take myself to counseling but i told myself i was being a pussy at the door and that life is something i have the mental strength to handle on my own. i sti will dont know if i was lying to myself. someti ames i feel like i wi will get through all this on my own, but someti ame i beg and pled with myself to walk into counseling and ask for some fucking help. i do not understand my own emotions. i really do not, i dont know where i stand. i feel like screaming at god for help but i can not even convince myself to pray. it is my family that keeps me going. although my parents have typical i ammigrant mentality they have been good parents and are the main reason i do not hurt myself. i dont know what the hell i am doing with my life nor do i know the direction its heading. i guess the only thing i can do is sit here, bump to some xxxtentacion, and tell myself it gets better. i assume it does, i hope it does. someti ames i am opti amistic but if i fall back into depression i see world through a dark and gloomy lens. i am trying to keep a clear pair on. i am going to go to sleep and hope tomorrow is a better day. goodnight reddit.	not depression
opening up to your so about how empty amp sad you constantly feel.. only to get little response really hurts. i know you can not expect the world to heal you, but i think it is reasonable to expect someone that loves you so much to try more than i do not know what to tell you, after them insisting you open up to them. specifically avoided opening up because i knew it would just make me feel worse when he could not comfort me at all. gave it a shot. guess we both did.	not depression
something good that happened to you i was talking to someone today, and they wanted me to tell them something good that happened to me over the last few weeks and i literally could not name a single thing. i barely even remember what happened last week because everyday is just the same old miserable shit. they had all these stories about their friends and things they have done and it just made me realize that i am not really living life in the same way that people without depression do. it is been difficult even finding a reason to stay alive lately.	not depression
how do you make friends if you re nothing? i have no experiences. dont go to school, dont have a job, dont go to parties, dont have a so, dont have friends, dont have any hobbies outside of watching youtube videos, dont do anything. i dont do anything at all. now since i dont go anywhere i can not make friends irl but id like to talk to people online. i can talk to someone on the internet for seconds until i am asked what i do for a living. even ignoring jobs, what do i even talk about? like i dont have any experiences to talk about at all. i dont do anything. never done anything. if theres nothing to talk about and i am not interesting or funny then is it even possible to have a conversation let alone have a friend at all even just on the internet? i dont think so. sorry for venting, also ignore my username. i am obnoxious and maybe a dick but i am not cruel at least.	not depression
i think i ruined my friendship i think i ruined my friendship. my friend accidentally posted her nudes on snapchat story, and i comented on it as a joke like pooorn and i feel really bad, i did not want to be mean, i just wanted her to see the snap so that she could delete her snap, and idk i make jokes out of the worst things... i think she hates me now.	not depression

y all ever just wish things were different? i just found this subreddit and ifek if this post qualifies for it beacause if just started feeling this way recently but its getting worse. i am in high school, male, grade . all i want to say is that i am sick and tired of sleeping hours everynight when i shoukd be getting at least hours, i am sick and tired of going to school for over hours every single fucking day and learning about boring ass shit that not only doesnt interest me, but that i wi will forget as soon as i step out of the school. ive gotten a job recently, which the money is great, but its insanely boring, and often stressful with no reward. what i mean by that is my boss stresses me out by telling me all these things i have to do with no ti ame to do them all, and even when i am able to work my ass off and finish i dont even get a nice job . plus working hours after hours of school is not only tiring as hell but annoying because i have no ti ame to do anything that i am actually interested in. i dont think i am depressed, i just want life to be different. i want to be , living with the love of my life, having a kid or on the way, and waking up every morning feeling rested and excited to go to work, whatever that job may be. i know being tired doesnt seem like a big deal, but for the past years of my life ive been growing and therefore need twice as much sleep as the school system allows me to get, resulting in me feeling not just grumpy but pissed the fuck off when i get up and all day until i get some fucking sleep on the weekends. anyway just needed to put this somewhere thanks if anyone read it all.	not depression
why is it always like that? why is it always like that? the day when i wake up feeling good about myself, mind was clear, fuck care unecessary voices and just focus on myself. the surrounding decides to pull me down, stir fry my mood. is it my feel good aura too bright. people can not stand? or was i thinking too much and jump into conclusion?	not depression
today feels like a nothing day today feels like one of those days where i do not want to do anything, which seems to be a lot lately. nothing days are the worst days. i type this as i am lying in bed. i skipped work as i did not feel like going in. i skipped breakfast as i did not feel like eating. i feel so lonely, yet i do not care enough to see anyone. someti ames i just wish someone would say good morning and good night to me, just to know that they are thinking about me, but instead i just sit here and feel sorry for myself.	not depression
if i did not have such high expectations, would i not be depressed by now ? f , i have about hours deadline to submit my final thesis for college but honestly i dread doing so. ever since little i do not think i ever was given the chance to dream. my mom constantly talks about young people becoming young ceos and have their own companies, so i assumed that was what was expected of me. my older brothers had issues with their lives and have somewhat decent jobs my mom thinks their job is crap , but i guess my mom was thisappointed in that because she invested so much in them. i took that as a signal that i am the last shot to restoring the family name i guess. i planned out my whole life since i was in middle school, planned stuff like joining the student council, enroll in the best high school, be the smartest in school, get a scholarship, graduate with at least a . gpa and work a to job and rise up the ranks until i die. so far it has been on track, but honestly, i do not feel the least bit happy about it. i was so tired, like every milestone i reached i had sacrificed everything a kid should have, like friends, fun, a sense of identity. and after all that, i would expect my mom to shut up about her expectations and say congrats ! you have done great ! , but instead she just says more ! you are not the best yet! i swear, the more i do this, the more i ask why does it even matter. i am working my ass off for who knows what. everything i do is a chore and the more i do stuff the more i want to lie in bed and do nothing. i just want to rest. a really long rest where i can try to find a goal, dream, my sense of identity, just fricking anything to give me reason to keep going. and perhaps i can lower my expectations a lot, so i wouldn t feel like a thisappointment whenever i failed like before.	not depression

well today is my year anniversary with my girlfriend. i am too depressed to throw on a happy face. this has been a awful week at home and at work and it is really making my depression and anxiety worse. i am supposed to throw on a happy face later to see my girlfriend but i know it is only going to make me feel worse. i have to sit through a movie later that i do not want to see, and having to drive into the city to do so. i live in a small town away from cities and traffic which i like. it is not her fault though. i am not blaming her. she deserves to be given a good anniversary. our anniversary just happens to be happening during the worst week i have had in a while. my depression and anxiety have been so bad lately and all the things i have to do and go through this week is making things worse. my brother just go home from the military and he is already causing trouble with me, my family, and my neighbors, my finals for college are due this week and i havent slept cause of it and would not be able to get real sleep until next tuesday, everyone at work is fighting for no real reason, and my anniversary today seems to be all about what she wants to do, not what i can handle or afford. how can i possibly be happy today? it is hard to block all of that out of my mind and throw on a happy face.	not depression

i hate dreaming of happiness, only to wake up to real life.. good dreams that make me feel happy are worse than nightmares... nightmares, you wake up and realize it was just a dream and move on. having a good dream that makes you feel genuinely happy, you wake up and realize that it was not real, and you re back to how things actually are. more or less, i hate dreams of things that i want to be real so badly, just to wake up and know they wi will never happen. i dreamt someone was hugging me, and talking to me, telling me how much i mean to them, it made me feel so happy because i have never hugged or emotionally to anyone...but then i woke up, alone on the couch, minutes until work..	not depression

i can not focus what is the point of this? it is just empty. nothing anyone could ever say would ever help, i need a better world to live in not a good friend to make the shitty world seem better. i can not focus on the good, it does not come because my brain is physically atypical. people wi will say to talk to other people whose brain is atypical then as if they wi will have the answers, but it is all the same because the problem is not the adhd or the obsessive nature of my mind, or the tremors and night ti ame twitching, it is not the tics or the tantrums or the emotional baggage i bring with me every day. the problem is not with me it is with the world. i am never going to concede to those arrogant fucks that try to tell us the problem is perspective, i am not interested in tricking myself into believing things are good enough. the world is not good enough for me or for most people, i am tired of hearing want tobe capitalists that struggle is the whole point. i am tired of being told nothing worth having comes easy, when in fact everything worth having gets harder and harder to get the harder i try. i do not know if people have noticed, but things are not getting easier they are getting worse and i am tired, i am so fucking enraged by healthy people dictating to us what reality is or is not. i am so tired of people with resources and ti ame telling me what to do with my ti ame. no, it is not that i can not focus i am choosing not to focus on the bullshit. i do not care if it is perceived as unhealthy, i wi will never give up the part of me that sees bullshit for what it really is. i wi will never give up the part of me that refuses to participate in fucking double think non sense. do not ever tell me things are ok, that they wi will get better, do not ever fucking tell me that. when you can tell me that you are going to make things better then i wi will have something nice to say. until then, do not come to me.	not depression

i love dreams but someti ames they can be kinda cruel and a bit fucked up so i had this dream this past night which involved my crush from the ti ame i went to uni. i have not seen her in like years and wi will probably wi will never see her again unless we accidentally stumble upon each other or if she wants to contact me for some reason which there is none afaik . she has been married for quite a while now and always had a boyfriend in uni. irl we were just acquaintances, not even friends really. but i really liked her. she has a wonderful cheerful personality, you can often hear her joking and smiling, she is just such a cute girl. so yeah, the dream. for some reason, in this dream we were walking somewhere together in the evening and were admiring beautiful architecture of the city. then she is on my left she embraces my right shoulder and i really feel it and i am pretty sure no one has ever embraced me like that irl . it felt wonderful and the i did the same to her. then, she started telling me how things are not working out between her and her boyfriend and that i should not be concerned about hi am in case things between me and her started developing into a full on relationship. and then the dream ends. a bit fucked up, considering she is happily married, at least i am pretty sure about that. i suppose that is my brain projecting some sort of fantasy scenario, but why tho. how does that help?... i hope i wi will find the answer someti ame.	not depression
not exactly sure what the move is also i write a lot and not afraid to share personal details. hoping someone sees this and has advice or can relate to what i am going thru i wi will start off by saying i am . life recently has been up and down. i have never been the slightest bit suicidal or had thoughts about that kinda thing. my childhood and early teenage years were pretty conventional, humble but i can look back and definitely say i enjoyed that period of my life. i have always been told by a lot of different people that i am really funny and have quick wits and i am fun to be around but at the same ti ame was always kind of a loose cannon. during certain periods of my life i have been very opinionated about certain things which has gotten me into some sticky situations, but that is beside the point. over the last year or two, i have noticed that my mental state is being very weird. my main issue is that i really do not feel any positive feelings anymore if that makes any sense. i feel apathetic to almost everything around me. things i used to do experience do not give any sort of pleasure. the music i listen to would physically give me goosebumps and put me in a trance now do not get that nearly as much, the sports i watch do not put me on edge at all anymore, when people compli ament me or when good things happen to me i do not get endorphins or any euphoria. inti amate contact sex does not do as much for me. there are ti ames i can actually tell that i feel inadequate. whenever i am in public or even around more than a handful of friends, i get flooded with anxiety. i feel petrified in my own skin for some bizarre, awful reason. i forget to smile, i can not come up with relevant funny things to say, i always feel like the secondary option sidekick to the people i am with. if i am at a party or something, i feel like all eyes are on me in a bad way and i am afraid to approach people even if i have known them and have spoken to them in the past. i do not feel this way all the ti ame. it is mostly just in certain social situations whether it is at school or even at a friend is house with people i have known since the beginning of highschool so like years. like i said this social anxiety of sorts started somewhere around last summer. ever since then i have felt fatigued, unmotivated, and scared to expand my social bubbles. for example when someone on snapchat asks me to hang, unless i have known them a while i get nervous. like really really just not wanting to. the feeling is very difficult to describe. i only mention it as noteworthy because that is not at all how i used to feel about social situations or most situations in general. and i am not going to lie some days i do feel ugly. it is weird i know i should not and kinda in a way feel petty and stupid for feeling like that but it is what i truly feel someti ames. i feel like a lot of these problems stem from a few bad habits and over indulgence on my part such as me having been smoking weed since i was about years old and the masturbation porn watching is probably right on queue compared to other boys guys my age. but yeah if anyone has any thoughts suggestions comments please absolutely share them i spent about half an hour typing this at am and sti will feel like there is more i can talk about but feedback is fully welcome.	not depression

i really do not know what to do. it is been a constant struggle with my dad and it is just been getting worse in the past years. we had to go to court because i have not went to school once this year nor talked to any of the staff. i drove away all my friends by ignoring them, i have not brushed my teeth they are starting to hurt, i do not even take a shower once a month, i do not go outside unless it is to take my dog out, i have the worst anger issues, social anxiety, and depression i have ever had and it is only getting worse. i keep telling myself it is gunna get better but i am not sure how long i can wait. i was gunna tell the real truth into why i really stopped going to school but i made myself believe it was because of the school either because i have such a dependency with my phone because it is the only thing i look forward to. i have the worst diet because i do not eat anything home cooked because i have some major ass trust issues. i have not really had a suicidal thought in awhile because i would tell myself i have a future no matter how long i have to wait, but now i am really thinking about how long my recovery process wi will be from all the trama i have been in. every ti ame i argue with my dad he just kinda ignores me if i do not say anything. i have to say something for hi am to say anything unless he is talking about some joke he said that was sooo funny. i go to reddit looking for answers but again i do not use them at all because i am not that easy. i am so mentally fucked up you nobody can help me. i most likely would not ki will myself but i am definitely going back to cutting tonight. and if i do not cut i wi will have a stronger urge to ki will myself so do not fucking tell me to do otherwise. i literally just throw my garbage and have been doing this for the past year on the ground. so this house is filthy, my teeth are probably fucked, i would not ever go back with my mom even though she is a better parent. i have no emotion unless it is for myself or when i am watching a movie. the only reason i did not fuck over my dad is because i am so goddamn dependent on my phone because it is the only thing that brings me any sense of joy. i tried fixing my dad for the past years but he is manipulative, he is abusive, he is in denial. he pushes things off like it is nothing when i am crying out for help to hi am. the deals i made with my dad not to fuck hi am over were si ample yet he has not followed through on any of them. i am pretty sure i have heart thisease and i am only . i want a life but i am never gunna get it. i just can not bring myself to do anything. not even with all the support i get from redditors. all of my dads friends support my dad. if we went to family therapy it would just turn into a argument because my dad does not want to look like a bad dad because he actually believes he is not. when i was i tried to ki will myself and i thought i survived because i was meant too. but that was a just a failed attempt. so i did not tell anyone. then my brother tried to ki will hi amself like a year and a half ago in the middle of the day. my dad drove my brother to suicide he is sti will alive and he joked about it. i just want it all to end, i am in pain both physically but mostly mentally. i am way too self conscious to do anything. my dad just can not even talk to me about fixing our relationship. he does not even try. i know he just wants to get rid of me and i think i should do just that. maybe it would show hi am to be a better person. but then again he would probably just joke about it. i do not want to ki will myself but that is what is he is driving me to do i do not want to give hi am that satisfaction but i am trying my hardest here. i have almost zero goddamn free wi will. i am literally tearing up rn and my dad does not even notice even tho he is like feet away when i am writing this. or he does and he just does not care. i just want to get a job save up and get the fuck out of here but i can not. i can not do it, i just fucking can not. my phone is the only thing i have, it is the only thing i care about and i do not want to mess that up by ending up in foster care. i just do not know what to do and i do not really know what the fuck you guys are gunna do to help me because you can not i guess i am just writing this to tell someone. i mean i live in hawaii. everyone is so fucking horrible here. i mean the last person i actually trusted took my weed and turn it into the cops did not even tell me then ignored me for months and got mad at me when i told hi am how i felt. he was the only person i had left and he broke his main rule. he was my favorite person in the entire world the only person i thought i could trust. everyone is so fucking fucked up here. everyone is either a psycho, something mentally wrong with them, something fucked up going on in their life, addicted to drugs, sex addicts, sociopath, overly nice, and some like normal people but mostly those other things i said. ok i am done being a cunt i am going to got cut myself to make me feel better have not done so in like years but thanks dad you have yourself to blame then not reply to any comments i get unless i do but i already know i am not gunna ki will myself so do not worry unless you do not like most people because most people are fucked up people and do not have any sympathy or empathy and are selfish as fuck. basically like me because i am so emotionally desensitized when it comes to other people. kinda like how people died in my family and i really did not care if i am being honest especially my grandpa because he was a complete psychopath like he pointed a gun at my face once and my dad wonders why i hate hi am so much. i wish he was buried so i can keep my promise on pissing on his grave. you know at this moment in my life i do not think i would cry even if my mom or little brother died. that is how fucked up i am now. i used to cry thinking about my family dying but now i really only care about myself and how i feel. when i get the perfect chance i am making sure my dad goes to prison because that is what he deserves. trust me abuse is not the only thing he wi will be going to prison for.	not depression

i am trying and failing to accept that i am going to be alone forever m. this year, i lost contact with all of my friends. and i mean all of them i have no contact with anyone, anywhere, as if i died and nobody told me. all relationships have failed, and where this started as there is no one in this world for you, you do not get a soulmate, you do not get love or happiness has grown to encompass everyone, as in friendships, not just relationships. i mean sure, i am sure i could find someone just as lonely as me and we stay together just because we do not want to die alone, because we know sooner or later our health wi will begin to fail and we need someone to drive us to the doctor, visit us in the hospital, take care of us at home, and so on, but no, i do not think i wi will ever be loved. and i wi will never have real friends, i have never had them anyway. i realized i have been this lonely all my life, as i posted something today about sti will having i amaginary friends, a group of very close knit guys and girls that do everything together, have the same interests, basically that friendship network we all wish we had, and how this is a coping mechanism for how lonely i have always been. i have never had friends, never had a large family, so they became the friends i never had and wi will never have. in real life i could drop dead as we speak and no one would even notice, much less care. i am going to be like this forever, i think. and i tried to tell myself that i need to love myself enough to not need anyone else, to not need friendship, love, sex, inti amacy, to learn to not need another human being for anything, to accept that this is my lot in life and i would best just deal with it, but i am failing to do so. it honestly breaks my heart, and as i realize just how lonely i really must be, it makes me want to cry. no one wants to be so alone. no one should be so alone, but life is not fair, is it. my mother is the only person i have left in this world. part of me wants to just move back in with her and accept that she is the only friend and woman i wi will ever have in my life, and just focus on being the best son i can. and when she dies her health is falling i should follow her out. because then i really wi will be alone, so why bother staying here? why bother staying alive? i do not know. i just realize i am very alone and very lonely and i tried to be strong and accept my fate but i do not think i can and wtf i am years old and sti will have i amaginary friends as some sort of sick and twisted coping mechanism for the friends i wi will never have in real life and i wi will never find love never find friendship and this all really just breaks my heart because i do not know what i did to deserve this and i know life is not fair and someti ames you just have to make the most of it but no one should ever have to be so alone	not depression

free from many years back, i met a kid. he had a hard ti ame trying to blend in with the crowd, he was nothing but a pain in the ass. he sucked at everything. he fails to step up on ti ames needed, he always goofs around, not giving a damn about anyone or anything. he argues a lot, a loud mouth and a bully. but within the reckless, troublesome kid i saw something different. he was nothing but a kid who was looking for a place to unravel his true self. away from all the accolades, recognition and gratification from the outside world. to be free is all he wanted to be. all his life, he did nothing but try to bring the best of hi amself to make people happy. but that was not what he needed. he had to stop portraying an i amage, away from what he truly was. he taught me that the first step in solving any problem, was to accept that you have one. with that we can accept things for what they truly are. letting go of all expectations, all standards and just let life move us freely alongside itself. he made me learn that life is so much more than just money, awards and achievements. the death of this young man has really taken a piece of me away. he has given me lessons that i might never be able to forget. living life for hi am was all in the tiny moments, the things we do not usually pay attention to. he showed me that without cold rainy nights, we can never appreciate warm summer mornings. we wi will never value victories without losses, and having a friend wouldn t be meaningful if you never lost someone. so far, this is the greatest lesson i have learned. we are all bound by the waves of fate. so instead of running from it, why do not we just let it take us? cry with despair on sad days and giggle like a child on light ti ames. in this world, nothing is truly guaranteed, so live in the moment. and just let life move you through it is course.	not depression

confused and looking for advice so lately, last months or so, i m have been pretty depressed.....i think. i do not know if it is actually depression or not or just a ti ame in my life where i am down. you see, the thing is, i am not always down in the dumps. i think i am actually a pretty happy normal guy most of the ti ame but every day there are hours where i hate my life and think about suicide...even though i know i wi will never do it. i do not really know what i should do. should i tell my wife? if i do, i think that there is a chance she does not feel comfortable with me being around our year old. if i do tell someone, is this something that is medication worthy? if it is medication worthy, is there a natural medication i can take instead? is this actual depression or just a down ti ame in my life? i guess part of me is worried, hence why i am writing this, and another part of me just wants to get this off my chest. so with that, i thank you all for reading and i appreciate all the advice and thoughts.	not depression

can not do anything right for fucks sake. it is only my second quarter of community college. i am working part ti ame, living with my mom and her boyfriend both super successful. we re not rich or anything but they are sitting pretty cozy, somewhere where i wi will never reach . paying rent because i would be an asshole if i did not. and now all i care about is money money money. going to school does not get me money i do not care about it. i have a girlfriend that i need to take care of too, i need money for that. it is all about the stupid green paper. green paper that i wi will never really get ahold of because i am a shit student who does not care about his classes which like, i am so privileged to have a community college, for the first ti ame, offer first years two completely free years with bookstore voucher. and i am just wasting it away because all i want to do is just work . dude, like wtf am i going to do. everything is setup for me it really is, i have zero excuse at all to be acting like this, but i am. she is my girlfriend of almost a year, i love her to death, all i want is to have a good life with her together. i do not know how i am going to manage that shit. i do not know how to do anything except give decent customer service at my shitty part ti ame which i give my everything to btw. i work so hard, worked up to a managerial level, and yet corporate is so dumb, i have given customers my own cash for change, at least a hundred bucks at this point that i am never getting back. having no motivation sucks. how do people do it anyway i do not get it. i am such a fucking child.	not depression
job applying season and i feel like a failure i am so burnt out that i do not even know where to start. i was struggling with my anxiety and schoolwork already, so i do not have a good resume like my colleagues. now everyone is talking about how they got an offer or a positive feedback from where they want their job and it makes me sad. i do not even know where and why i want to work at. i thought i started to like my profession but compared to others i am just a bland person. the worst part is that even with these worries i never try any further. i just stay in bed and curl up. i thought my uni was the biggest contributor to my current state of mental health but now my blame has just shifted to the next step. i do not want to live like this.	not depression
i think i get triggered when i am called beautiful it just feels so fake to me. no matter who says it, when or how it activates my fight or flight reflex. i want to argue and change the subject, especially if it is out of the blue. it feels almost condescending. even if i know they are telling me what they think is true. it makes me feel bad or like i am fishing for more when i tell them to stop or that it is not true but i truly just want them to stop because it sends me into such a mentally panicked state 	not depression
no, ti ame does not heal all wounds.. some things wi will never be the same again. some parts of you wi will be buried underneath the sorrow never again to resurface. the pain and confusion might tear you from the inside out, altering every aspect of your personality that once made you yourself. all of your good qualities withered away along with your hopes and aspirations, we are rendered unrecognizable to even our own eyes. we become people that we used to know. nothing more than fragmented memories of better days. ti ame does not heal all wounds. we si amply just learn to live with the pain as shadows of our former selves.	not depression
sudden self conscious i have been in a real deep hole for the last couple weeks, so personal care has not been great. last night, my so pointed out, as softly as he could bless hi am, that i was starting to smell. he was really torn between whether to tell me about it because he did not want to make me feel even worse. i took it in my stride last night, but this morning, i am so anxious that, if he noticed, who else has? i have been to uni, around friends and other students, i have had meals with his family, all within the last few days. i think it is ti ame to get in the shower 	not depression

would it really be that crazy? to live in my car, or maybe even off the grid eventually? no, really. think about it. living in a car. i have been thinking about this idea for a long ti ame. i just feel too overwhelmed by the expectations of family and friends, my own failures, and the fact that a month of rent is more expensive than some used cars. ive always been the stoner loner type. never really made many friends but ive always kinda preferred that. i look back fondly on those days where i could be alone. i am currently living in a two bedroom apartment. my dad was the other renter but he moved out literally a week ago to make room for two new roommates. literally moved his shit across the city to a new place. wait knock knock whats thi uh oh one of the roommates has credit to cry about and is not approved. i am overwhelmed by what a fucking monumental fuck up this is for the plans we all keep talking about. it seems really strange that this is just now becoming revealed. i literally learned about this all last night. so now i am in a fucked position where i have to either let them sublet which is it is own set of problems or tell them no deal lets find somewhere else. the problem i am kinda living in the cheapest place around already, and well if my friend is credit was not anything to go off of... and so i ask, is this so crazy? to just do one last fuck it move and just bail on this entire operation and just live in my car? the obvious answer is yes that is crazy, you d be homeless and think about your friends and family. so? like i said i often just sleep in my car these days and dont even go inside half the ti ame. i am like half a foot in the water already anyways with this situation looming over my head. i thought this was just a musing fantasy, buts its been especially recently so overwhelming that i just dont know if i can resist pursue living this life. i am so conflicted and scared and tired. and that thought to just get in my car and go somewhere else and never look back is becoming hauntingly dazzling.	not depression

i think it is ti ame for me to accept that i would not ever feel another woman is genuine touch in my lifeti ame. i have never been one to express my emotions or to share my feelings with anyone, even less strangers, but i thought that reaching out might have a chance of doing some good. i am , and i have been single my entire life. i live in a world with friends who are changing out relationships every couple weeks, telling stories of their love lives and the amazing women they have had a chance of being with. it affects me daily, because i know i wi will never experience those things. i have tried online dating, i have tried going to bars, i have tried just approaching people in college and none have ever worked. i get matches a month while my friends get hundreds. keep in mind were all just average looking, so it is not like i have warts and sound like trump while they are bruce waynes. i think i am just unlovable. the people which i have thought i have had chances with just wanted me for attention or free food. people who love my compli aments but then go to other guys for relationships even though i was open with them telling them i wanted to try something out. i am short, at ft and i know a big chunk of women are shallow enough to i ammediately cross me off their list, but even then i hoped at least one more would want to see more of me. but i do not think that is going to happen. all this mindless rejection and denial has made me hate how i look and what i do. i find myself thisgusting and as a guy, i was raised not to cry or show my emotions. i spend my ti ame smiling around others and then going home and desperately trying to hold in tears that are too powerful to keep at bay. i know this is my fate and no one wi will love me. i know i wi will never be held or told that i am good enough. i have come to realize that now. let us just hope my heart can accept that soon so i can move on.	not depression

losing a loved one who is sti will alive has ki willed me. it has not made me realise how precious life is, has not motivated me to grip life by the neck. its made me give up, its made me sob uncontrollably for no reason, its made me hate people for no reason, its made me feel alienated from normal people, it is made me hate myself, it is made me fail at everything in life, its made me numb towards everything, it is made me want to cut this journey short because this is all an i willusion and a sick game to most people and i just do not want to play, i want to skip to the end. yes i am weak i am probably the weakest minded person you wi will ever meet. i have never been able to do anything that is beneficial for me, i can not do basic things a year old could do. been jobless for years and sti will nothing making me want to get a job, people and life just freak me out and every living moment is exhausting. i am not in control of my life and do not feel i have ever been, or maybe i am just a lazy son of a bitch who just does not want to get better. all i ever wanted was her back, that is it. everyday i get further and further away, i wi will probably never get her back and people do not understand why this thought makes me want to not be alive. i do not want to live for myself, nothing i do for myself makes me feel good anyway. i am too old to be feeling and behaving like a child, these were supposed to be the years where i am supposed to enjoy the most instead everyday i am fi willed with regret and guilt of losing my happiest ever moments in life and my best friend. i am fascinated by how normal people can just get over things and move on, it is something i have never been able to do. i do not deserve to be alive, i do not deserve to be a parent or any worthy relation to anyone. i am broken, broke, thisintegrating everyday. new problems arise everyday and i am just buried under problems from years ago. none of you really care and none of you can really do anything to help. i am stuck because i can not even live anymore. i am so alone, i hate myself for getting myself into this place, i hate human beings probably ignorant as fuck but i thislike everything about this life. i am a miserable cunt whos given up and has no hope anymore. maybe this is one of my mood swings but either way i do not want to come back from this, this defeat is enough, cli ambing back up them stairs costs too much mental stability and i am fragile. i embody everything people hate, i do not have the characteristics of people who are inspirational and successful. i realise my place is in the dirt and taking orders from others because i am weak and people realised that before i did. i have always been so slow to catch up to things my whole life and its made me miss out on everything. it is great that everyone pushes the whole positivity and motivating words but what about those who never got better why does nobody talk about them, why not understand them, why is there only meaning in those that did exceptional comebacks. its always oh aww that is so sad, that is it. they do not care if you do not make it out, they wi will brush it under the carpet because it does not fit. that would not be you though i did not think i would be this me years ago now look at me, unrecognisable, full of shame, full of regret, broken beyond repair. my only hope are god, doctors and me. life has lost its beauty that is for sure.	not depression
how to just go to school? i am not struggling with depression as much as i used to, but i sti will have a lot of the same mentality as i did before. the entire, why go to school if it would not even matter eventually? lol, i am staying home today for that exact reason. it makes me feel bad because i go to a selective school and so many of the other students would never even think of staying home the way i do. it wi will also be a poor reflection of me on college apps, i guess. what should i do or tell myself to mini amize absences?	not depression

free this story is meant to educate others on what happens when people are left alone for too long. hi, i am nolan, and this is my story, before i die. i am currently in highschool and probably would not make it ti will graduation. when i was younger, around , i liked trains and dinosaurs. i liked pizza and watching movies, playing in my backyard, petting my cat. i went to a catholic school, at first. i never had any friends, everyone always avoided me and treated me like shit. i was too young to notice. then i was chosen to switch to another class, several weeks into grade , losing everything i was familiar with. it turned my world upside down and i expressed that i did not like it to teachers and my parents. my parents tried to get me back into my old class but the school refused. my grades then plummeted, which was unusual since no one ever gets bad marks in early grades, since it is considered so easy. having that little friends and no one who ever talked to me i became desensitized to others, having no contact with other kids. my grade teacher was lazy and a terrible teacher, she told my parents i needed adhd meds. when i was on them my attention was worse and i would eat my clothing. i would get into to trouble and break other people is things, not knowing what i was doing. other kids would yell at me, telling me to shut up. i would sit by myself and collect rocks. someti ames a kid named ethan would talk to me, but only when he had no one else to talk to, and when it was convenient. i was not old enough to see this, all i saw was someone who was interested in me for once. older kids would bully me, i remember once they spit on a rock and handed it to me. i turned it over and saw the bubbly spit and threw it away. it hit a car and my parents and the older kids were charged . i found minecraft and started playing it, it was a way to escape my sad life. they took me off the meds after grade . in grade , i ended up with the teacher all the kids would complain about, saying she was terrible. i was also with completely new kids who i was not familiar with, and ethan was in another class. the principle knew most of the kids at the school, and knew i was with a grumpy teacher, and with no one i knew. she did nothing about this. my parents had had enough with the shitty school and terrible staff, so i was moved to a public school. so for grade i changed to a public school, i never had any friends in grade either. i did meet a kid who already had a friend group of and they did not want me in it. at this point i was desperate, so i clung to them and followed them around, no matter how many ti ames they told me to go away. i was teased all year, the friend group was bullied since i started being near them. i did that for all of grade , sti will receiving cs and ds. in grade , the friend group broke, leaving, and i slipped in, and they tolerated me, too tired to try and get me to leave. i invited them to my birthday party in effort to get them to like me. declined, saying he would rather see it with his family, after getting the invitation with ti ame and place on it. then he came with his dad and literally spies on my party, both of them laughing at me and peeking around corners. yes i am serious. they even booked seats behind the party row, and talked to all the other people i invited, no one talking to the guy who invited them. i also met some batshit crazy girl, who said she liked me and wanted to have sex with me. i was wierded out, and she never kissed me or anything. i told my parents and she got in trouble, we never talked again. she moved on to making out with kindergarteners. from grades i had decent teachers, but my grade teacher was the worst. he was the kind of teacher to do team captains and let the unpopular kids be last. i was also targeted by a kid named yousef. he would make fun of me having no friends and me eating by myself. he would shove me on the ground and elbow me in the back of the head. the teacher did nothing. the principal did nothing. kids would tell me words i did not know, because i was dumb and did not know shit they would tell me to point my middle finger up, and tell people i was going to rape, not knowing what any of that means. i would get in trouble for it, and the kids how told me to, wouldn t. eventually the friend group of broke up, and i just followed around one of them, who would create i amaginary worlds with me, he never really wanted me there, i was just someone to i amagine things with, it did not matter who it was, but it made me happy all the same. we made i amaginary stories, walking up and down the stone path in the school field, making ourselves pok mon, or wizards, or people with superpowers. i saw hi am as a friend, he saw me as someone to get story ideas from. and that is is what we did from grades . grade , i realized i had to rise above others, there must be something about me that makes people avoid me and hate me. so i studied. i rose from cs to bs. i got bullied by a different person, named hassan, he called my dad a dog, punched and shoved me, insulted me, and ulti amately started my way into depression and suicidal thoughts. grade i rose from bs to as, i sat by myself, after trying to get friends for so long i gave up. i talked to no one and just did my school work. the guy who would walk with me wanted to escape, even he was bored of me, but i would hassle hi am ti will he played more. i graduated elementary, and my depression got worse. i started thinking more serious suicide plans. i spent the summer missing when i was young and innocent. i started highschool, grade , the guy i walked with had finally moved to the popular people, and was glad to be rid of me. i took music and sewing and cooking in hopes of meeting a girl. i ended up just liking the courses and everyone treating me the same. avoiding me and not giving a shit, not wanting to have a conversation. i tried to see a psychiatrist but talking did not help. neither do the meds. i rescued duck eggs which were abandoned, and i eventually had to give them to a farm since it was i willegal. this made me ever more depressed. now in grade i take more cooking, and music. i am learning guitar and spanish. sti will everyone hates me and does not care less if i died. i have thoughts of shooting up the school, or murdering and raping people, as revenge for my terrible lonely life and the poor hand i was dealt. i plan on doing any of these things and then ki willing my self. ironically, by train, what i loved so much as an infant wi will now set me free.	not depression

help me, i am slowly turning into a mysoginist piece of shit and i do not know what to do. i do not know where else i could post this, and this sub is where people have always been nicer to me. it relates to my depression, as i feel this issue worsens it. if anyone thinks i should post this somewhere else, i would love to hear your suggestions. i had a very bad, traumatic experience with psychological abuse coming from a woman i used to be in a relationship with. she gaslighted me for years, and then falsely accused me of abuse to try to make me look bad. that is not what is been turning me, but it relates to the problem. over ti ame, other women i opened up with have either tried to mini amize it, deny it or call me a liar and a piece of shit for trying to ruin a woman is life because i could not accept the break up . as ti ame went by, i si amply gave up trying to open up. it only made things worse. instead, i do my best to be kind to people and see how that goes. it has not worked either. that has led to women calling me weak, pathetic, and a typical man either an abusive monster or a blob who wants a woman to lead his life for hi am . lately, all the women i try to talk to are either thistant, trying to avoid me or assume i only want to try and get laid that is obviously not the case, i just want to make new friends . it is been increasingly hard to not get angry at women in general. in the last couple of years, women have gaslighted me, tried to convince me that i am a monster si amply for the way i was born and even accused me of abuse to get away with their own abuse. women have done to me a lot of what they clai am to be trying to fight with feminism. and i know how it sounds when i say things like that. that is why i am asking for help. i used to be a progressive person, but lately i have been identifying more and more with those stupid, sexist memes from incel forums and things like that. it is awful and i feel awful for it, but i si amply have no history of women not being complete assholes to me. what do i do? i feel like my efforts to be a better man are only valid if i am attractive enough. otherwise, i am deemed a liar or pathetic. i once saw a trans woman ironically respond to a tweet that clai amed men are monsters from the moment they are born by saying something like oh yeah, there is no such thing as a good man. the only two ways out for men, then, are to become incels or suicide. i really feel like that is true for a lot of women nowadays. i have gotten past the suicidal tendencies, so now what is left? i do not want to become a mysoginist piece of shit incel.	not depression

i have a lot of love to give but nobody wants it i feel like i have so much love and caring to give, but nobody to give it to. it keeps getting rejected. i am pri amarily talking about romantic relationships, but also friendships. do not tell me it is a reflection on them, not me, because most other people get to give and receive love. i have been trying to figure out the difference between them and me, and can only come to the conclusion i am somehow not loveable and unworthy of love and happiness. it is always been like this, it is not a result of depression but a cause for it.	not depression
gave up on relationships so throughout my life i have only dated people. most of the ti ame i fall for people who do not want me. this was the last one. i have never in my entire life felt this way or this strong about someone. i promised i would never marry but her i would. call me stupid for saying but this shit is deep. and when i start telling people how i feel they say i need help. why? bbecause i have fallen in love with someone who does not even look at me that way. i have been told that i should jus keep trying but when people tell me i sti will feel like there is hope it wi will happen but at the end of the day we re only friends and that is all it is ever going to be. i have officially given up on females. i have said this countless of ti ames but i truly believe that the person who is right for is in front of me. and if not explain how i am supposed to find someone when this girl floods my mind all the ti ame. ig i am jus not meant for love. do not fall in love with your best friend. it is the worst thing you can do.	not depression

i am f and i hate myself i hate myself i make ways of fitting on cool extroverts in our class so that i can feel better for myself. turns out, it just gotten a lot of worse. i am roughly insecured that most of them are brave and smart enough to have partners, drink alcohol, effortlessly open up a topic in a conversation , pass exam without even trying to study, and being attractive human being. i really think they are great and fun to hang out with. they are caring even tho i someti ames do not open up problems that much. i do not see anything bad about my extrovert buddies. i am really losing my mind for hating who i am. i dont like the way i look, think, act or even speak because i stutter a lot. i want to ki will myself. my parents think i am dumb, my mother always compares me to someone is daughter. my father is suffering from financial problems but kept making me feel that i am useless inside this house. he wi will not even allow me to be alone in my room, i can not have ti ame to cry to pour out this heavy feeling inside me. i have good academic results, i passed of my major subjects. i am sti will not happy about my life. it feels like not appreciating everything that meant to be appreciated and its hard to live in this constant shithole that i am living in. no one even likes me, no one thinks i am attractive, no one sincerely told me that i am beautiful. no one thinks i am good at anything. i wi will be lying if i told you i already have notes in my journal about saying goodbye when i die	not depression
says your childhood messes you up growing up in an unstable household where your mother was always unpredictably extremely anxious ready to cry crying and where you could tell you father was angry by just feeling it from the way he was carrying hi amself but you had no idea when he would blow up makes you such an awkward, cautious adult. you spend your entire childhood walking on eggshells, constantly scanning the emotional field or feeling of your household, so you could prepare for or prevent your dad blowing up or your mother crying... constantly making sure people are not mad, or are okay ... and then you turn out like me, insanely sensitive to you significan not other is every single mood, facial expression, tone of voice, even text. every little mood change could mean they are upset, and it could always somehow be your fault. like it is your job to protect them and do damage control. it is exhausting and hard because if you re like my so, it can be really annoying to have someone constantly and basically unintentionally trying to gauge how they feel and address it and fix it... and like i get that it is annoying. i am sorry i am like this, please do not be mad at me there it is again 	not depression
thinking about the upbringing of others i always think about the mi willions of people out there that are not going through any of the bullshit in my life and are doing well for themselves. people always talk about the genetic lottery which i have definitely lost, but i always wonder how many others ended up with being born to shitty parents and forced to grow up around shitty people, while others had it all go relatively alright just because of how they were born. i would be so much better off if i was born around different people and raised under better circumstances. so fucking unfair how many people slip through the cracks and have no choice but to grow up in complete bullshit that no one should have to experience. the amount of manipulation, stress, and heartbreak in some lives is nowhere near what i have gone through and i wish i could have that. it astounds me when i see people smiling and sharing their joy with friends. it seems far fetched and unreal. i sti will hope for a life where i am finally away from everything causing me pain and around people who care about me, while i work on myself and become successful. but i am also scared of something like that because i can not remember the last ti ame i was truly happy, and achieving such a life would probably make me feel like i am finally starting my real life. this is why i have always felt like i have not really grown up. i wish i could restart it all on my own terms and wi willingly forget everything that happened in my life before that moment, if it even comes, until there is no trace of the pain i used to live in.	not depression

there is hope but it usually means a lot of work. m here with depression or rather depressive states coming and going on regular basis. i feel like there is a lot of people like me here and i just want you to know that there is hope to get out of this. the problem is that there is work that has to be done. there is so many ways to help coping with this darkness. meditation, being active someti ames to to the point where it becomes an obsession , breathwork, psychedelics, therapy and many others. someti ames, i come here to read your posts and my heart breaks how many people are suffering and do not have proper coping mechanisms. life is not easy, i would say it is very hard for most people but also most people are not wi willing to put work into making their lives better. become obsessed with something, learn new thing, get out of your comfort zone and for gods sake change the pattern! some people wi will say that depression is preventing them from doing all those things and i agree to a certain point but give it a shot. maybe it is not as bad as we think. maybe it is just an i willusion! my heart is breaking seeing so many people depressed and i wish you all that you find the courage and strength to live your life fully. we have only so much ti ame here. lots of love to all of you!	not depression

if one feels like one does not belong in social groups, it is because the mind fears stagnation. it is like being taught by a poor mentor. you know he or she is holding back vital knowledge. you want this knowledge. you desire it, but you do not know how to ask for it. social groups are the same way. you can spend a lot of ti ame with the same friends or family, but you wi will never develop into the person you were truly meant to be. this is why i highly recommend people spend ti ame isolated and reflect upon what it is they value most of all. align your morals and ethical code so you can function in the real world as an individual and not as apart of a group. being a part of a group is a sure way to stagnate. unless these people are facilitating your safety, growth, and happiness, i highly recommend you physically and verbally take yourself out of their lives.	not depression

paranoid i am in a long term, loving relationship with a beautiful, funny, smart, and overall perfect girl. whenever i express my concerns to her, she assures me that they are completely invalid and that my head is just doing that thing that it does. but basically, she has been very busy lately many extracurriculars, two jobs, issues with her family , so we have only really been able to hang out once in the last month or so. i know that it is because she is just busy. but i sti will can not shake that her feelings for me are not what they used to be. i have told her that i am worried, and she always says that i have no reason to be, and i believe her. i just have this constant feeling in the back of my head that she is getting ready to leave me, and i wi will be completely alone again. i have held for awhile now that when not if she leaves me, my life wi will lose its final purpose, and i wi will make my last decision with a clear conscious. these worries are compounded by the fact that whenever she needs me most because of a struggle with her friends or family, i get scared and ignore her messages. i know it is a horrible thing to do, but i have a bad habit of selfishly making situations about myself without even meaning to, and i do not want to say the wrong things. i know she realizes when i suddenly stop texting her, and i am sure she wishes i wouldn t, but i am too much a coward. i completely fail at the main thing of a relationship, that being to support her, and i know that she recognizes that. i have also for months been having the stupid, selfish thought that i want her to break up with me so that i can finally end my life. i have even thought about breaking up with her for that sole reason, despite being happy with her. i feel stuck, afraid, and more alone than usual. i do not know what to do anymore.	not depression

today. is. different. i have been in this darkness for so long, everyday these pounding thoughts eating away at my very soul. the constant fight for my own life as my mind tells me i just can not do this anymore . the routine of nothingness i have created for myself failing to go to university classes i can barely afford, failing the family who try their best to encourage me. i find myself not wanting anything anymore, no career, relationships, not even happiness. but today is different. today i do not feel this overwhelming pressure caving in on me. i feel okay . it is a jarring feeling, going from thoughts of death before bed for months to waking up laughing at the little things. i do not even understand this feeling anymore or what it even means. i can sti will feel the thoughts in the back of my mind. but something, at least for today, is holding them back, i can physically feel it. it is like a barrier in my head, shielding me from the outrageous thoughts. although, through the mirage i sti will have fear. fear it all comes rushing back a river of endless thoughts i might drown in. but not today. today i feel aware. aware that these negative thoughts are not real aware that contentment happiness is real. it is like my senses are in overdrive, going from complete numbness to euphoria at the si amplest things. maybe today is the day i finally seek help. not just for me, but for my family. i wish you all the best. thanks for reading. this was not my original idea for what i was going to write about but i sorta just poured out my thoughts when i started writing.	not depression
starting effexor after precious doctor set me up for failure hello everyone, this is my first reddit post ever, did not think it would end up here lol. but anyways, i have always been an anxious person, but had always managed myself well. i workout everyday, am honest with friends and family etc. i do a lot for my mental health. i vaped smoked heavily and quit december th cold turkey as i knew it was not good for my anxiety in the long run. anyways, i constantly worry about minuscule things, but it finally caught up with me when i started dating my new girlfriend and got severe performance anxiety. i was so anxious i could not get in the mood, and it made things really tough. i was really down on myself for a while, and finally decided to see my doctor around new years and talk about it. he recommend paxil mg which would eventually go to mg and also gave me viagra keep in mind i am m, so this is very unlikely needed . i was anxious from the start of taking paxil because i read about the increased risk of sexual side effects with it. although it did help with my anxiety, i completely lost all interest in sex. i messaged my doctor and was telling hi am about the symptoms, but he ignored email, after email. i began to feel hopeless, worthless, and thought about not being here a lot. weeks ago i decided to try a new doctor on my college campus unh . when seeing hi am, he was very helpful. since then i have started counseling therapy for managing my anxiety, which has been very helpful, and even managed to ween off paxil. but i sti will felt hopeless as i sti will had no libido and was constantly worried about my girlfriend thinking less of me i know she wouldn t, she is very supportive i am just in my head . after lots of surveys, blood tests to rule out other possibilities, and long emotional conversations with my new doctor, he determined i was moderately to severely depressed not surprising as i am a junior in a mechanical engineering curriculum . i have to wait another week to start effexor as i was sti will weening if paxil this week, but am excited. i have heard lots of good things about effexor. i would really like to not feel so stuck anymore. to enjoy being out with friends again, have the motivation to work hard again, and maybe to feel passionate about my relationship again. i know there is sti will a lot of work to do, and sexual counseling may be necessary to get me out of this sexual funk. but i figured i would share part of my story for anyone who may need to hear it or is going through the same thing. not all doctors care. hope everyone can find peace of mind and know you re not alone. i left out a lot of details but the last few months have so many roller coasters, it wouldn t be possible to put everything in this. but this is all the i amportant stuff 	not depression

it is late and i can not help but think what is wrong with me i am just struggling so much with loneliness that is been eating at me. over the course of a few months, many things have happened and i have lost so many friendships and contacts that i can not help were all my fault. it hurts seeing them living their lives, looking happy and full of people because i know i was never really nothing more than a pasisng thought in their lives maybe if that . i just miss being able to call others my friends and jt hurts so much. i get that i am not as funny as others or i get jokes and stuff or have bad conversational and social ski wills, but it would feel nice to be cared about, to be thought of. idk, all this loneliness makes me think of how i could just thisappear tomorrow and no one would notice, how easy it would be for me to pass and not have a person care. i know that is probably not the case, but my mind is just amplifying this thought to the max, along with the thought of how horrible i am. sorry for the rant, i just needed to get this off my chest, try to make myself feel better.	not depression

slipping after six months due to pressure i am putting on myself to pass a certification exam. first ti ame poster on this sub, i hope you are all winning your fight today. i just need to vent. i have struggled with depression and anxiety all my life, even as a child. until over a year ago i just did not know what to call it, because to me it was just normal, i just thought that is the way everyone views life. it took me almost a year to get from knowing i need help, to searching for help, to getting blocked from help because i must be an addict, to getting help. i am in a better place now than i was six months ago thanks to a great therapist and psychiatrist that takes me seriously and a supportive wife and daughter. i am with no degree and have been working at the same place for a living for years. currently working towards various self study certifications to transition into the it field which has been something i have wanted to do since a teenager. i received no support or guidance on how to reach my goal from anyone in my life and felt lost at sea since i did not have it all figured out by the end of high school. thanks to therapy and meds i have been going as hard as i can on studying, but damn is this hard. i work over hours a week, come home to be a dad and husband, then what little energy i have got left i am pouring it into these studies for just a hope and a prayer of a career change since i am competing against people with degrees even though a degree does not guarantee you know what you are doing . i am at war with the dark parts of myself every damn day, pushing back, cli ambing up this damn sheer cliff wall of regret and hopelessness. i am afraid i am going to put all this work into these certifications and it is going to be a waste of money without a degree. i have read over and over that i can break into cyber security without a degree, but my mind keeps making me feel like the deck is stacked against me. my fantasies about me turning into a black ink drawing and then melting into the floor or blowing away in the wind are coming back, at least not as strong as they used to be though. the last few nights i have just become one with the couch instead of studying because i feel like i am already not going to pass the exam. this turned into to long of a rant, sorry about that, i am going to keep fighting and hope all of you decide to do the same.	not depression

i really am tired of getting angry at people who do not deserve it because of my depression language warning today i f yelled at one of my group members in english we were talking about a book and had are google slides so we can all right something about the book. i did not read it because i usually need an audio book and it was hard for me to find and every ti ame i read the book i loose where i am at and instantly forget what the hell is happening. so we re on are tablets in google slides writing down answers for the question what is new orleans like? everybody wrote most of what i was thinking of and i was trying to think for the longest ti ame what else can i say? one of the said did you write something? i said no i am sti will thinking you said most what i was thinking she replied well you have to say something while you re thinking we re going to move on. which pissed me off because she knows i did not read the first chapter of the book yet and she probably thinks i am a lazy son of a bitch that does not want to contribute even tho i do want to contribute! after that the bell rang and she asked again you know you have to write something down and i said i did but but it is only one word she said well you got to write more than one word you can not just sit there and no do anything then i got angry and cussed her out saying well i am fucking sorry i can not think of anything else for the question!! i literally wrote something down i am trying my god damn best here!! so fuck off god damn it!! . then everyone went out to their next classes and i am sti will heated and i also regret it because i usually do not like to be mean to people i am just depressed and want the day to fucking be over. i wish i could have apologized sorry had to vent that out.. tl dr doing a project about a book in a group did not read it we tried to answer a question they said most what i wanted to say could not think of anything but one word got angry because one of my group members thought i was lazy telling me i should do something instead of sitting there even tho i was trying and i got angry and cussed them out. probably a bad summary 	not depression

i tried to reach out... making friends in law school is horrible so i am in law school and i moved to a different state for it, and i have been having a really hard ti ame making friends. many of my peers are very privileged and can go out on weekends and spend money at bars, and that was how several got close at the beginning of the year. as i support myself, and at the ti ame i worked on weekends, i never went out. furthermore, your first year of law school you re put in sections and you have all of your classes with your section. so i have had every class since september with same people. this causes it to be very clique y and almost reminiscent of high school is social structure. which is awful in and of itself. i had a friend i thought but i turned out she did not really care about me at all, and basically just tolerated me and talked about me to her other friends in our section all the ti ame. that was a hit to my self confidence, and now just seeing that group laughing and talking at the beginning of class or leaving together makes me sad. since it is halfway through the second semester basically everyone else is basically settled in their groups of friends, and since i was busy working first semester and thought i was friends with someone, i just kind of ended up on the outside of everything. i also recently had some family problems, i lost my job and have financial concerns, and my mental health is getting bad again, which makes it harder for me to put myself out there as it is, because i start over analyzing every interaction. i am becoming increasingly lonely, and feel so isolated. yesterday, i tried to reach out to a girl who has been friendly to me in the past, by texting her and asking if she knew what the attendance policy was in one of our classes. she read it but never answered. i am honestly really upset. i know it sounds si willy, but it did take a lot for me to reach out. and i just feel like i need a female friend... someone i can just vent to like i did my friends from undergrad. my boyfriend is amazing, but he works five days a week, with an annoying commute and the last thing i want to do is unload on hi am and complain as soon as he gets home. the more isolated i feel the more self conscious i feel and i am just becoming more and more lonely and anxious. i hate gaps in between classes because i sit in a corner of the library alone wondering what is so wrong with me. i had a great social life in college. i do not know what is happening to me and i am just so lonely.	not depression

wi will this ever stop? my entire life, ever since i can remember i have been told that i have an anger problem. when i was very little i had this very explosive anger. it was never just angry all the ti ame for me, but if i felt like i was in the right there was nothing my mother or father could do to calm me down outside of brute force. i accidentally broke my mothers thumb when i was like or . in kindergarten my sisters locked my out of our house and started laughing at me through the frosted glass on the door we lived in a camper so i put my fist through it without even flinching, or thinking about it. a few days later we went to see a dr, and when we all got there my mother, myself, and sisters everyone talked in a little room for awhile and then when we were getting ready to go they told me i wasnt leaving. i couldnt go home with my mother, and sisters. i had an anger problem and so i was going to stay there for a little while. i am honestly not sure how long i was there, it was someti ame right after school started and i didnt get back until after christmas break, and i could feel every single boy and girl in my class laughing at me and calling me names. since i stayed in the same school ti will high school i was known as the kid that had to go to the crazy hospital, and always laughing, pointing. always groups of friends for them, and i would never be accepted by them. i played baseball with a few people from class and even they pointed and laughed, spreading lies about me, reminding me that i was crazy. made even worse as soon as i hit first grade because i had scored very well on my iq test so i went to gt twice a week for half a day. now i am the crazy kid that is also slow. they didnt come with me, and so they assumed i was in remedial classes because those kids had a si amilar patterns. by middle school sti will the same, and i dropped out and started self medicating. eventually i found something that seemed to work, in a terrible way.hydrocodone. it didnt take long for me to graduate to heroin and digging holes in my arm. as many ti ames as i have tried to quit, i always relapse and its always the same loop. i have been told a mi willion ti ames that it i would just stop with the drugs that it would end. i am now and have been clean for months and the roller coaster only seems to be gaining size. i want to get a job, but the thought of the judgement and laughing behind my back is all i can think. nobody in their right mind would give you a job look at you, clearly a junk box, get out of here is what would go though my mind. i can not even go to the dam store anymore. the thought of it all makes me sick. no matter how hard i try, i can not make myself go face them. my family doesnt speak to me anymore because they are rightfully ashamed of me, nor do they believe me. all you got to do is get off the drugs and all of this wi will stop. you re doing it to yourself. that is what i have heard a mi willion ti ames over. how can i make this end? its not all the ti ame, but most. other days i have so much energy that i could run to the moon, except sex sex sex first. i kind of realized my mood swings have patterns and depending on the day i could have the sex drive of a machine or its just gone. no in between. i am not asking anyone to diagnose me or anything like that, and i have not had any thoughts or hurting anyone nor myself. does anyone know how to obtain medical records in arkansas if the hospital has been long since shut down?	not depression

i just seem to be loosing the wi will to care anymore so long story short i have been struggling with depression and anixety for a while now and over the last few months it is been spiking and i just feel like shit all the ti ame, i hate a lot of things now and find myself wanting to just be alone and things that normally bring joy to people are not doing it for me anymore. my family relationship is not the best and they are all the way down in georgia i am in wisconsin i hate where i live, i hate other people my age, i hate being gay, i hate my looks, hate my job, dentist told me out of the blue i have gum diease so that is fucking great even tho i brush my fucking teeth, mind you i am only , i hate my job, can not tell real from fake friends, and overall i am just not happy with my life. on paper i should be happy since i have my own luxury apartment. nice car, good work ethic, can usually travel a few ti ames a year, eat healthy and just seem like the nicest guy ever. but inside i just feel like shit. i honestly do not even feel as most of those guys get to fuck around and not be full ti ame adults but me? nah i dont get that luxury. i know many people worse than me yet nothing bad ever happens to them or at the very least they have people around that give a shit about them. i honestly feel like no one gives a flying fuck about me anymore.	not depression

luck runs out i am and it feels like my luck has just run out finally. i managed to get into a college prep school on scholarship when i was going into high school. i worked my tail off and got into a pretty good college in a major city on full scholarship. i was involved in my fraternity and won us awards while on exec, i met my wonderful girlfriend, and i had solid internships throughout my ti ame in college. i have always fought to get what i want, but now, it seems like i can not anymore. i could not find a job in the big city i went to college in for months after graduation, and my majoring in philosophy did not help i was too opti amistic about majors not mattering and studying something you love . when i finally got one, i pounced on the opportunity. at first, things were fine, but now i am at a point where i dread waking up. when i do, i lay in bed because i do not want to go to work that badly, so i am late. i am so mentally drained not from the work itself, but the environment, so when i get home, i do not want to do anything with friends. but i do not want to go to work in the morning when i wake up, so i stay up late which makes me tired counterintuitive, i know. i do not even want to go out on weekends and i would rather just lay in bed only to get up for the bathroom or postmates. i have been lashing out more and more because of a shorter temper now, and even when i realize, i can not suck up my pride and i ammediately apologize. i know compared to other people is problems, this seems minor, but i have never felt this way about anything before. i feel guilty hating my job and wanting another one, i feel guilty not being able to get a better job, and i feel guilty for even feeling down about this. my girlfriend thinks i am depressed, but coming from an asian i ammigrant household, that is never been a thing. it is always been look at how bad other people have it be grateful and get over it. i am scared there is no getting over this one and that i have been found out as a fraud, that my luck is run out, and that i am set for failure here on out. thanks for letting me vent and rant.	not depression

i thought the worst was over but i was wrong. thisappointed in our world. i have been depressed for years, with breaks in between. years ago i went through hell, got kicked out of uni because of my depression and came out of an abusive relationship. i was ashamed of my sickness and brought it up too late, got in trouble, the university decided to kick me out. i could have won against them if i went to court but i had no more energy and money to give them, i wanted to move on and forget. i moved, started a new major got some credits recognized and less than a year later, i was very depressed again. i talked to university and felt they were more supportive than the last, but it sti will was not easy and i kept feeling worse. last november a friend committed suicide and that really dragged me down to a very dark place. i managed to get accepted for a scholarship interview since i am quite involved in extracurricular activities and most of my grades are good. the application was hell because some professors refused help and i was already in a bad place, so i felt alone and like no one believed in me. finally, profs agreed to help me and i felt like someone was supporting me in my path. the application process required a lot of tears and energy, i had to reflect on my past and my failures, which sti will hunt me. my therapist was very busy with me during that ti ame as i felt suicidal, but in the end i was proud i managed to finish it regardless of the depression and constant panic attacks. something unexpected happened they invited me to an interview, hours away from my home. i accepted, prepared, investing lots of fear and energy into the process. i felt it went well and was hopeful the horrible dark period would end, but i was wrong. they do not want me. other amazing people were not taken, while some difficult cases got in girl i saw stealing from supermarket , but overall the majority got in. i am obviously extremely frustrated, i hoped this would be a step into brighter ti ames. i hoped it would mean change. but now i feel very very down, i feel like society has no place for people like me, even though i am smart, critical and contribute to society. i feel like it is all pointless because society is sick and they do not deserve my help if they can not see my value. i have been let down so many ti ames, while complete assholes are getting free rides i live in europe, my parents pay lots of taxes for the free riders . there is no justice, there is no reward. some are condemned to a life of suffering and there is no escape. right now, i just want to watch the world burn. my country had a rise in coronavirus cases and i am hoping for things to collapse. politicians are talking about pandemic plans and closing down infrastructure. i feel like we do not deserve better.	not depression
am i a failure for taking a break from college. sorry if this is all gibberish i am not in a good mental state and i just needed to vent since i have no support system i am taking a drawing class i love drawing and art but have no ski will at it at my college i have missed two classes now because of my depression. my boyfriend of almost years broke up with me and being in a room full of talented artists while mine sucks makes me want to die. i am thinking of dropping the class cause it fucks with my self worth but i just feel like such a loser. i feel so lost i do not know what to do and am having serious thoughts of ki willing myself. the only postive thing about me is my creative ideas and i can not even create them because i havr no ski will at art and i am just a talentless failure .	not depression
it seems like my life is only getting worse i do not seem to care about anything anymore. at least i had the wish to get better when i first got depressed, but now i just feel like a hollow, everything feels pointless to me and i can not even bring myself to love and care about people who really deserve it. when i was a kid i had a huge heart and cared so much about the people around me but now i have become a narcist without any feelings at all. i do not want to see myself living like this, i do not think i am going to live long if i keep this attitude but as much as i want it i really do not see myself changing ever again.	not depression

losing ti ame and memories to depression i am sure a lot of you can relate to living life indoors, in front of a screen, passing the ti ame to numb the sadness. i have spent so many years like that my whole teenage years. the only way i can remember mostly anything positive that happened is through photos. i spend of my ti ame alone, trying to numb the anxiety and nervousness and feelings of inferiority. i can not even remember most of last year. yesterday i went for a long walk on my favourite trail, i saw so many birds and the sun beat down on my skin and i felt alive. i remember every ti ame i leave the house, or go out in nature and i ache, because i realise that is what being alive feels like. i want to live properly because i am so afraid of being around people, every ti ame i leave the house i remember the rapid heart rate, the feeling of being watched, so that is a lot of what i can remember. i miss being young and not being consumed by thought or having my mind influenced by anything, just going outside and feeling like i belong	not depression
never underesti amate how much your environment can affect your mood i do not know the scientific cause of it, and i do not want to say stupid stuff. but today, i got the next normal people does not have that much tea! from my own mother. normal people. i love tea. i am a quirky person. they can not deal with it. they want to change me. i would not change for them, this is me, i love myself the way i am. or at least trying to. just remember, you are good the way you are. if you feel, that you have to change, then change. but not only because others want to force their ideology in you!	not depression

too conflicting for me, the worst part is constantly being in conflict with everything i do. finally have the courage to speak up in class regarding something? regret it moments later, overthinking how it sounded to everyone else, and coming to the conclusion that i am dumb and should not attempt that ever again which is why in general i do not like talking with others . buying and wearing something that seems cool and fashionable in order to feel good about your appearance and boost self confidence? never touching that piece of clothing ever again, because i keep getting anxious over how it may stand out, and how people may end up thinking that i am pretentious, fake, and a trend chaser. feeling a little productive by having a steady day? oh, but remember all those ti ames that you failed being productive, all those ti ames that you stayed in bed instead of doing what you were supposed to, and ended up regretting it? well, regret it now as well, just because you had a productive day does not mean you are a productive person. lonely? create a tinder profile and go out of your way to start conversations. oh wait, look at all those likes that you did not get! after all, you are not handsome, relevant, or even confident, why would anybody want to get to know you? should not have messed up that amazing relationship you hard years ago, huh? well, that is your fault as well, and you wi will not find anyone even close ever. every ti ame i get a gist of confidence in doing something, in the end it just gets ruined because i do not deserve any of it.	not depression

trying to help someone else to at least want to try to get better? not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice but. so i know my boyfriend has had depression since he was about , which is also when his drinking problem started. long story short, he is been wanting to ki will hi am self for a while now and he says drinking is the only way to numb it. recently, there have been bruises and yellowing on his skin where his liver would be, and yesterday he told me he is pretty sure his liver is failing. he said that if it is then he does not want to get it treated because he wants that to ki will hi am so he does not have to do it hi amself. i did not know what to say and i do not know what to do. he believes he just can not be helped mentally and it breaks my heart.	not depression

zoloft and weight gain? hi all, so i was diagnosed with major depressive thisorder when i was about years ago now. i have been on a variety of medications but about years ago i was put on quetiapine seroquel xr for bp . about years ago i moved to a different city and started seeing a new psychiatrist who changed my quetiapine dosage and put me on mg of zoloft. since then, i have gained about lbs in about a month period. my lifestyle has not changed other than that i have actually been going to the gym a lot more since i have noticed the weight gain. i talked to my doc about this and she insists that zoloft has very little affect on weight gain, and decided to take me off the quetiapine completely, saying that there is more correlation with that med and weight gain than there is with zoloft. my question is, has anyone experienced weight gain with zoloft? i did some research of my own and there are studied that day there is correlation. it is i amportant to note that i also struggle with bed, but that it is been i amproving, so i am not sure how much that has a part in the rapid weight gain. i am currently the heaviest i have ever been in my life and it is sending me into a spiral. anyone who is had experiences like this and has any advice would be greatly appreciated! tia!	not depression

would you class yourself as being unwell as a result of mental i willness? i am interested to hear people is opinion on the notion of being unwell when it comes to mental i willness... i had this thiscussion a while ago with a therapist and it was quite interesting to see different perspectives of what we mean and define as unwell ... and how it is possible to become attached to such a notion and idea in a manner that is detri amental to recovery. are there thistinctions that can be made between body and mind in the context of unwell ? e.g. would you class experiencing a mental health crisis and experiencing suicidal ideation as unwell? would you class having cancer as being unwell? when does mental i willness become defined as unwell? is it a matter of severity? management? classification and type of mental i willness thisorder? i am interested to attempt to make thistinctions as i can sort of see where blurring occurs but i do not feel i am quite fully comprehending it the thistinctions. to complicate it further you have different schools of thought such as the medical model and recovery model etc... to me it seems almost a matter of personal opinion however is there a general consensus for thistinction? we could even consider to make no thistinction between the experience of being ... in such a case it is seem arbitrary whether the brain or body is experiencing being unwell... it is all part of your identifiable experience of being ... and do we make the thistinctions to define the brain and body as mind? it seems to be a matter of personal judgement and opinion... rather philosophical in pursuit. it is interesting... would you only be unwell when you are experiencing severe mental i willness or a crisis? and when you are not in those states are you si amply recovering? are you well or unwell then? i am interested to hear your thoughts and thistinctions, i feel it may help some confusion for me.	not depression

this is what helped me overcome my depression. this wi will help you too being a sufferer of depression, and finally overcoming it after years of unbearable torture, it is my moral obligation to let others know what helped me overcome my depression . first let me briefly tell you what i was going through so anyone reading this can relate and know that i too had faced the same problems that you are facing now. and i did overcome all of this. i did get better. and you can too i suffered from depression for years. it was an unbearable situation where my mind would be bombarded with sad depressing thoughts throughout the day. i could aomehow make it through the day and finally sleep off, only to wake up to the same horror the next day. there were days when i just went to sleep so as to get relief from my monster mind. i tried several options to get myself better. i quit smoking, quit alcohol, meditated daily. but nothing was working for me. and then finally, when nothing else worked, after years of suffering, i opted to go consult a doctor for my condition. i was prescribed medications. i took them. and i got better. sounds si ample right? well that is the catch. people suffer for months and years, but hesitate to go see a medical professional. while you can and should try all sorts of alternate methods to help with you depression, like medication, quitting smoking, alcohol etc., but without professional medical attention the equation to a better mental health remains uncompleted. to anyone suffering from depression and contemplating whether to go see a medical professional, this is the universe telling you to go seek medical treatment. when you realise that you may be suffering from depression, for whatever reason it may be, its your responsibility to take steps and get out of it. take action, get out of it and tomorrow you wi will be advising some other guy to do the right thing. empower yourself so you can empower others. to go through depression is a really painful experience. and one should never suffer silently, especially when there is a way out. go seek medical attention today. empower yourself so you can empower others. lets fight depression together.	not depression

i am mad at myself everything feels like a fog lately and i am sorry if i ramble or poorly articulate anything. it is hard to describe my feelings when my feelings do not feel linear or rational to start. i do not feel anything lately. i do not feel strongly about absolutely anything. i am very lonely but i do not have the energy to make an effort to make friends or reach out to the ones i have. i love planning and knowing how to prepare but i do not know for sure where i want to go next in life. i know what i need to do on a day to day basis and i know what tasks i have to complete but it is becoming so much harder to do them when i do not see the point. i am not having the classical i work for years and then i die realization and breakdown. i have already accepted that and want to have a career that is fulfi willing so it does not feel like hell going to do it and i understand the i amportance of hobbies and living for the little things. i do not mind working and living for the things to look forward to. it is just that i do not look forward to anything. i can not make myself think positively. an artist i like is coming to town? overpriced concert tickets and feeling bad about the way i look in public and going alone and dealing with traffic. new show came out with an actor i like? i might not like the show and it wi will feel like a waste of ti ame so i might as well rewatch the same thing for the th ti ame instead. everything feels like work and i can not convince myself to do anything. everything leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. i dropped out of school and have my groceries delivered and do not refi will my prescriptions or see a therapist or go to a doctor because i can not and do not want to leave the house. it is been weeks since i have left. i feel so empty but most of all i am mad at myself for feeling that way. i also have regular worries like my appearance and feeling like i would not be loved or the people i am attracted to thinking it is laughable someone who looks like me likes them. and worries about god and religion, as i was excommunicated from my church. ever since then honestly my life has felt empty. i just wish i felt anything again. even sadness. i do not mind feeling negative emotions, everything is worth feeling. i just wish something was strong enough to make me feel it. i do not really need advice. and i do not want someone to talk to. i just kinda wanted to be able to say this and address how i am feeling without the pressure of being expected to answer for it. i am so tired.	not depression

slipping back down idk guys. this post might be me venting about what i have been thinking about a lot recently, but i guess it is becoming harder to find a reason to not ki will myself? recently i have been getting stuck in my head about how little people really matter to me. one of the mind tricks i do is think about what if so and so was to die? i have thought that losing close friends would just be an inconvenience, but i would move on, and that my i ammediate family is who tethered me here.... but recently i can not help but think why should i give a shit? . my family and me have never really been that close hugging, saying i love you, talking things through, etc... so it makes sense to me why i dont feel any meaningful connection with them other than them just always being around. my thoughts are i am the one that has stopped me from ki willing myself , i am the person that matters most to me . dont get me wrong i like myself. i am fairly confident in myself and defienelty know what my weakness are as a person, but if i am the only one that matters to me, and i am unhappy, then why wouldn t i want this all to stop? the idea of ending it does physically upset me even now as i am writing this because it is almost like i really dont want to ki will myself, but it just seems like the most reasonable choice. maybe not now, but eventually. people keep telling me that i wi will find a job or something i enjoy, and i do have things i enjoy excersize and art , but those hobbies of mine dont seem like enough to just keep grinding away through this life. i have really tried to think of a way that i could have a career based on either of those, but nothing sounds enjoyable like being a manager at a gym or realistic like making it big in the art world . i just dont have goals or motivation to look forward to in the future. i used to think traveling more would be fun, and sure it would, but going on vacation is not a career. everything just seems to lead me to a path of working away to make enough to pay the bi wills, and for what? so i can just continue my hobbies in my small amount of free ti ame and on the weekends? i dont want to ki will myself, but it just makes the most sense.	not depression

the big empty need advice hey guys, i am generally curious how many of us have depression in the form of feeling nothing at all most of the ti ame . growing up, commercials and stereotypes made me think depression is only being sad. o what a naive bastard i was... no it comes in the form of recurring daydreams of past happy or exciting ti ames or it comes in the form of me just feeling ai amless in life, like a robot with an inner monologue. i try to think of what i could change to combat this i have a great relationship with my family and gf, just got a dog, have a job that is not the worst i have ever had, have been exercising and sleeping better than before, quit drugs and have been withstanding as much alcohol. none of it seems to make me feel like a real person. i do all these good things for me yet, feel emptier and less hopeful now than ever. i feel like this whole life is nothing but a dream that i am about to wake up from. i am not sure i want to wake up if that reality is anything like this. what do you guys do to make yourself feel whole and present? i used to meditate in an effort to feel present but it never cut it as much as i wanted to.	not depression

today is my birthday and i want to die life has not been easy for me, just like most people on this sub. i grew up in a lower middle class family but somewhere along the way my parents finances slowly went down. today i am turning . for years i have been living alone in my possibly haunted apartment. i do not have real life friends aside from work mates, i only have enough income to survive, and every few days i just think about offing myself here in my bedroom. yesterday i was told by my landlord that i need to pay dollars in months and i literally have nothing in my bank account. life is so expensive and unfair and i never go out to drink, party, or spend on anything aside from food and essentials. today i am thinking about just giving up. the only thing that is stopping me is that i do not want to i amagine my mother is cries when she finds out. i have tried to save money, but it all somehow gets used up by bi wills and emergency expenses. i do not know if i am overreacting or something. i am just so tired. wi will it get better? how wi will it happen? i have done everything i can. switched jobs, further lowered my living standards, someti ames i even pray to whoever is up there.	not depression
finally opening up. i have run from pain most of my life and now i am in my mid twenties realizing that i have bottled up so much with no room for more. i am alone, in an awkward spot trying to cold turkey off un healthy behaviors, substances, and people and i do not know what is really right, wrong, healthy or not. life does not stop because i need to get better and all the pain is rushing back like a tidalwave that i can only brase myself against. so this post is the start of me digging my feet into the ground and not trying to run. it is only day one and i am ready for everything to get a lot worse before it gets better. i hope i am ready and i hope i have spread enough kindness to not be alone in it. maybe together we can find the next step.	not depression

hate me, hate me...something october... is not divorce inevitable anyways? why should we drag it out or try to fix it? we have been fighting about the same shit for most of our marriage. i feel like neither of us wants to be the one to initiate but both of us know we are doomed. he does not love me, he does not care about me or what could make me happy. he does not try to fix anything or problem solve or be tolerant. everything is about hi am, what he wants and what he can get out of me. none of the good i do for hi am is ever noticed, everything i do is bad. i am the scapegoat for anything wrong in our lives. its not like i am clinically depressed, working nearly full ti ame, managing everything in our household, being the pri amary caretaker of our son and going to college half ti ame....oh wait, i am all those things. he finds the most soul crushing reasons to be mad at me and make me feel like a bad person. my friend is single and recently got out of an year long relationship. she going a little wild on tinder and likes to share the details of her conquests with me, even a dick pic once in a while i figure its a phase so i dont judge her about it or make anything weird i go with the flow. i just nod my head and listen to her. i was not trying to hide anything because i did not think it was wrong. it is not like i am asking to see dick pics or that i get anything out of it. my husband walked in and freaked out. like its a prelude to cheating. like i am shopping for dicks right along side her. the past hours have been unbearable and i am ready to fucking die. i am a bad person my friend is a bad person, shes a slut and whore and me hanging with her makes me one too, i am going to cheat, i am going to do this and this and that and blah blah blah. i drink too much, i party too much, i spend too much ti ame with her. i am a lesbian now. i am irresponsible with money. i spend too much. how dare i have nice clothes. i make home cooked meals instead of jacks frozen pizza every night like he wants. i have too many opinions and its not okay for me to criticize anything about hi am....but i am a wide open free for all target. blame me for everything, suck my soul dry. everything is always all my fault. just fucking ki will me already. get it over with, my ears are going to bleed.	not depression

i think i might be depressed my ex girlfriend and i had a very nasty break up four months ago and ever since then i have felt incredibly bad. my emotions are a complete rollercoaster one moment i can feel relatively happy, then a minute later i am super sad or angry. the littlest things completely fuck up my mood. nothing excites or surprises me anymore. i barely laugh anymore and when i do it feels forced. i am super bored all the ti ame. someti ames i wish that i was dead, just so i can escape life is and society is obligations. i feel like everything i do or could do is utterly useless and have no hope of ever finding anyone or anything that wi will keep me occupied like my ex girlfriend did. i sti will want her back even though i somewhat despise her for everything she has done to me. i do not even know why i am posting this, i guess i just needed to vent.	not depression
death amp nihilism i can not stop thinking about the fact that everything eventually comes to an end. you can try to picture the ideal life to live spend years of your childhood learning the basics of life, grow up and earn money anyhow, fall in love, get married, buy a house to start your new family, make sure the children do not die, try your best to avoid thiseases, get a thisease and eventually die. everything seems like a redundant cycle. and i just can not stop thinking about everything. i am so focussed on the end result of everything that it is difficult to live in the moment it is difficult to be happy with life when you know you can not keep it forever. the problem is not getting a satisfying answer to solve it. religious people say that i am lost. i say they are just unaware of themselves being lost, too. god is existence can not make anymore sense than existence itself if god exists... atheism does not really solve anything either, but at least it does not add to the mystery god would just be another unnecessary layer over it, which slows us down from getting any real answers. sharing this here does not really make much of a difference. but maybe it wi will help to know others understand. i can not really talk to other people about it without ruining the mood. thanks for reading! d	not depression
need your suggestion few days ago my office friend told me that he was in a relationship for years before marriage. his parents never approved of their marriage so they got seperarted. he got married to someone else years ago. had a kid. but he saw his old love few months back. and that girl is also married. he says that those feelings came back again and now he is being following her since last couple of months. he talked to her once few weeks back but she scolded her badly and asked hi am not to talk again. but dude is sti will following her. he can not get her out of his head. my theory is that he can not accept the fact she got married and it was a love marriage. dude can not sleep and he is not eating well. any suggestions??	not depression

ig follow recommendation the.holistic.psychologist i have found her posts to be extremely applicable to many of the problems i am now working through that feed into my depression. maybe some of you wi will find it helpful, too? they are quick posts that take complex ideas and put them into si ample, easy to understand terms, and someti ames she wi will expand on them with a long caption. here is one such caption how to do the work when we are triggered, we are experiencing a wound from the past in the present moment. let us say we are in line at a grocery store. we re browsing magazines when someone walks right past us getting in front of us, not noticing we are there. the feelings come from the body during this trigger. the thought stream from the ego comes into play they are so rude typical ignorant person cutting in front of me. our ego preservers the core belief about the false conditioned self i am not seen. i am not considered. then we hook into the emotions of this story, and we re unconsciously caught in this loop for hours. someti ames days. if we re really triggered, we wi will repeat this story to other people to re live our emotional addiction to this belief. our work is to question. our work is to observe these stories. to breathe, then consciously choose a new response in alignment with our true self. let us go with a trigger from someone closer, our mother. she makes a snide comment about something we are wearing. we re triggered. the ego starts talking she always does this. she is so critical and wonders why i do not want to spend ti ame here or she is right i knew these pants are not flattering, i need to loose weight. our ego preserves the core belief about the false conditioned self i am not worthy as i am. we have gone into a spiral of all of the past ti ames our mother commented on our body appearance. if we remain unconscious, we ll engage in a predictable dynamic with her. another way to keep our emotional addictions active. another way the ego wins. if we remain conscious and do the work, we wi will just observe. we wi will breathe. and pause. creating space to see that her comments come from her own wound likely the same patterning said to her by her own mother then we can choose a new response. we can engage differently, getting a small gli ampse of our power beyond ego. triggers are teachers. allow them to be. you ll allow yourself transformation selfhealers	not depression

wi will i ever find somebody as good as her? so basically, i have been dating this girl for almost years now. it was my first relationship in over years and to say the least, it was a pretty good one. other than having our ups and downs and arguments she was always there for me, she did not leave when i told her i had no money in my bank account, she actually tried wiring me money but i did not accept the transfers, this had happened multiple ti ames.. the only ti ames i was truly happy was when i was with her, we were together almost every day for the past years, cuddling together, making love together, hugging each other. but the past few months have been hard, we have been arguing a lot, almost every other day and we have blocked each other now countless ti ames. i think she got fed up with me because last week she blocked me on everything and just ghosted me, i have tried making new numbers to text her and i get no response, it ki wills me to know what she is doing? if she is with somebody else, if they are making love together. she was my real first love and i think i wi will never be able to get over her.. i am so fucking sad.	not depression

if you know that the rest of your life is going to be nothing but wage slaving for barely enough to live and that the good days are over and not coming back...what is the point? i was thinking about it and i know there is an chance i wi will never be happy again. i am not suicidal or anything but i do not see the point in living this way at the same ti ame. i am starting to think id prefer to do something drastic rather than just continuing the carrot on a stick on a treadmi will lifestyle of lower middle class life. id rather be poor living life on my own terms than your typical tiny cog in the machine existence. it ki wills me i will never truly get to see the world or get the experiences life offers when you are wealthy. i saw a vice video years and years ago about cowboy capitalism in africa and it honestly seems way more appealing to me than sitting here and living your typical middle class existence. wake up early...go to job you hate...come home watch some stupid tv show or sporting event...eat dinner...go to sleep... do it again the next day. over and over and over ti will i am dead. i do not want to be one of those people whos highlight of their existence is i stopped for a coffee before work this morning and the voice is on tonight . terrifying. sorry for rambling but i guess my point is i dont think i csnt handle the monotony of average life. anyone else think that? i do not want to die necessarily but at the same ti ame i do not want to continue living, not like this. i do not think antidepressants would change anything either because no matter how many chemicals i have or do not have it does not change my philosophy or worldview. anyone ever pack everything up and start a new life somewhere?	not depression

i am untalented i have always liked creating things whether it is writing or art photoshop, but each thing i have ever tried was not good enough. there is some people who just make it on very little talent, but on their humor while doing said thing, but i have not quite cracked that either. i do not even know why i need to feel successful at what i create... to feel i am worth something since me alone is not enough? i do not know. i feel stupid each ti ame i get frustrated over this since i usually was told if i am happy doing it that is all that matters or that most people are not talented, but i sti will deserve to be here. now i do not even get any responses back when i vent about this on social media.. none for this past year beyond when i ask if anyone can see my post.. then i might get a yeah i can see it . i think people ran out of things to tell me or they do not care for me at all, one or the other. i do have family who cares and is supportive for the most part, but beyond them, i am not sure anyone else really enjoys what i put out there... hard to tell on social media when a like could just be a way to get reciprocation. i do not know... i am just having a rough night thinking about how talentless and alone i am which hinders my inspiration to create. creating does help when i am doing it so i want to continue regardless, but it is tough when i begin comparing myself to others and feeling like i have nothing worthy.	not depression
i feel hated by almost everyone i first meet an easy answer would be wonderful, but i am sure it is for more complicated reasons that i am just not aware of and couldnt describe in this post this might be super boring, so to anyone who reads this through and offers me any possible explanation, thank you. so at first i thought it was just my social anxiety telling me i was looking into things too much, but i have honestly come to the conclusion that there must be something inherently extremely off putting about the way i act, especially when i think collectively at all the situations ive been socially rejected. now i fully understand why someone would come to hate me over ti ame since there is plenty of reasons for that, but it seems that a lot of people almost i ammediately thislike me. ive never had a single friend throughout all my ti ame in high school, and i didnt have any friends at my job, and now in college i sti will havent made any friends. but it is not that no one talks to me, people start talking to me someti ames, but very soon after they either stop, or i sense a change of tone, like theyre only talking to me out of pity. off the top of my head, here is some examples from this year that i noticed this pattern of people talking to me then soon after realizing it was a mistake in one of my first freshman college classes i met a girl, she chatted with me first and repeatedly sat down next to me, but over ti ame i could sense she regretted choosing me to be the person she befriended for that class. one ti ame we had to work in groups of four, and everyone in the group ignored me when i tried to talk it is not like i was butting in or something, whenever there was a silence i tried to jump into the conversation, and i did this a few ti ames, and each ti ame everyone else would start talking over me . eventually the girl who normally had to chat with me in the class turned to me and asked me something to let me speak a little, and i could tell that it was because she felt bad for me. so this is an example of someone seeming to be fine with talking to me at first, then their tone shifts to pity. in another of one of my first classes there was a guy who would sit next to me in my bio and chem class, since we had the same one and they were back to back. at first he talked to me super friendly and seemed chatty and nice, and he asked for my number. then literally one class to the next, he suddenly seems to really thislike me. he would sti will sit in the same row as me and talk a little, but he would always make sure that he was at least one seat away from me, so there was an empty one between us. and i thought that is fine, like i figured maybe he is just a person who likes a good amount of space for elbow room or something. but then i realized that he would sit next to the person to the other side of hi am without a gap, and if in bio there was no room to make that empty seat between us, he would make sure he would move a seat over in chemistry class. idk, this one in particular just really hurt my feelings. he would sti will talk to me, but his tone shifted, i am not sure if it was to a tone of pity or to just trying to not make class awkward. another dude from class in college who gave me his number, who at first seemed fine talking to me, then suddenly seemed to really thislike me. all my roommates, especially one of them, almost i ammediately i got the sense she was pissed off or annoyed with me. and it really wasnt all in my head. she cut any conversation i tried to make as short as possible. literally everyone i ever met in high school, which is very very few, and i always figured that they didnt like me because i had a reputation for being the weird quiet kid, but in hindsight, some of these people also seemed totally fine with me within the first few interactions, then took the shift to seeming to feel sorry for me or annoyed by me. clearly there is a pattern here, but the problem is i honestly dont know what i am doing wrong. i know plenty of reasons why someone should hate me, but within the first few surface level interactions i think i cover up my horrible qualities pretty well, so i dont understand how come their tone seems to shift so drastically with me. it is not that i smell, i am not strikingly ugly, i dont think, and i pretty much always stick to safe uncontroversial subjects when i talk to people. i dont know, and i doubt anyone else really can from this explanation either, so what i was wondering is, has anyone ever just felt a bad aura from someone? like for no particular reason, you just can not help but really thislike them? i am wondering if maybe, despite how hard i try to hide them, my bad qualities somehow manage to seep through into my conversations sti will, so i just give off negative energy that people can not really help but thislike, even if there isnt a reason that they can place their finger on. if anyone somehow understands this or has some sort of advice, it is really appreciated.	not depression

do you ever turn your phone off, someti ames for days? i am dating someone who seems to have done this. his phone has been turned off for almost a day at this point. i am definitely not blocked, it is just been turned off. before when he is been depressed, he wi will go a long ti ame just not replying, but his phone wi will sti will be on. i suffer from depression but personally do not shut my phone off while i am that state, so i am wondering if this is something that you might use to cope? little context to hi am shutting off his phone last night we were going to watch a movie via video chat. in the middle of us chatting right before we were about to video , he stopped reading my messages suddenly. i kept messaging but they weren t getting read. over the course of an hour, instagram showed hi am as active online a few ti ames, but he was not opening my messages. i guess he was out of it, or likely just talking to someone else....i am sti will confused. either way, i started to worry. he is also prone to serious seizures. i kind of blew his phone up. asked hi am just to text when he can because i am worried about hi am. i woke up this morning, and was told on instagram that he had read my messages minutes ago, and did not reply. stupidly i tried to call even after hi am not replying....went straight to voicemail...as opposed one ring and then to voilcemail that occurs when blocked , so i know his phone is shut off. i can sti will message hi am on insta and other apps, but i have refrained from sending new ones. obviously if he wanted to reply, he would have done so this morning after seeing them. . i hope he is ok and . wish i knew what i did wrong initially, and also why he read all my messages and i ammediately shut his phone off.	not depression

did i fuck things up? what do i do? okay so, i am and addicted to fucking pi wills and i think because of that i lost the love of my fucking life, okay lemme explain. on wednesday i was at school and i went overboard, i always take one in the morning but i just did not want to feel anything, i overthink a lot so whenever the smallest thing would go wrong between us i would start overthinking and fall in this deep void where i need a pi will to get me out, and tbh i thought xanax could help me just fall out of love, boy was i fucking wrong. first period i was on one xan i barely felt shit and i waited until second period and sti will did not feel shit, that is when i went fucking ham and popped another xan, the went to the lobby and popped another xan. i do not remember much but from what a friend of mine told me i fell like ti ames face flat onto the floor, and the girl that i love started asking why i took so many pi wills she was fucking worried about me and my dumbass told her to go fuck herself and took another xan then looked at her mocking her and took another one now at this point a friend of mine took my pi wills away or otherwise i would have been dead by now and to be honest that is how i would rather be if i am not with her. she then texts me saying how things are going to change between us she was on her period so even worse and i do not even remember what i said, but i tried apologizing the day after on tuesday but she told me that she sti will felt the same that she cares and appreciates me but not in that way anymore, i apologized yesterday too telling her that i was the one that fucked things up, i was the one that confused things again and that i was the one that acted like a fucking retard on wednesday, she replied yeah it is alright i love you fucking idiot and tbh i could not be more confused right now, i am going to give her space because after all we have been through and all she is said to me, i just can not accept that she just changes with me again. on tuesday when i see her i am going to just stay away, i am not going to be a fucking dick and look at her the wrong way but i am not going to wait for her outside of the classroom like always yes we re in the same classes and that makes it worse i am posting this on here because i need advice, what do i fucking dooo??if the vibe it is all wrong next week and she actually does not give a fuck about me, i wi will just off myself, not that she wi will miss me anyway.	not depression

abstract from an article which i read. thought it might be useful which brings me back to my work as a therapist. while the breadth of exercises and techniques employed in act is beyond the scope of this article, there is one exercise i would like to share that has helped some of my clients see the inextricable link between valued living and painful experiences. in this activity of which there are different variations , the therapist first asks the client to write on an index card some of the internal experiences they are struggling with most difficult thoughts and judgments, emotions, memories. i ask them, what do you notice when you read that index card? i feel awful, i do not want this. what do you want to do with the card? i want to throw it in the trash. then the client flips the card over, and i ask them to write out some of the things that are most i amportant, most meaningful to them being a parent, caring and supporting others, learning, growing, etc. what do you notice when you read this side? warmth, it feels right, this is who i want to be. where is the pain, where is the other stuff? sti will here, on the other side of the card. what happens if you push that pain away, escape or avoid it? i push the meaningful stuff away too. in your heart of hearts, what does your experience tell you right now? if i am going to do the things that are i amportant to me, be the person that i want to be, i also have to make room for the painful stuff.	not depression

subvocalization, visualization and memory. i was wondering if anyone else experiences trouble with memory and thinking. hopefully, this post does not break any of the rules. whenever i try to explain this to people, they do not understand and look at me sideways. ever since my depression reached a stage where it convinced my brain as suicide as a viable option, it is like the only thought that is ever produced. it is the final thought that has been created. for the past four years, i have had issues visualizing, which is a tremendous way, i think unless it is i amagining a suicide. this make is it difficult to do schoolwork such as math as i can not trace the steps in my head. i can not subvocalize either, which is essentially thinking or talking to yourself in your head. below is a theory about why this is. i had spoken to my psychology professor at college after learning about rumination in her class. i told her that i had a theory that the reason memory and thinking issues may have transpired from the depression was because of rumination. rumination is when you focus on negative events and go over and over it in your head. so i thought my brain must have protected itself against this by shrinking my hippocampus, making it more difficult to recall these negative memories, but this also made it more difficult to recall all other memories as well. i had almost eidetic memory before this i willness got me, and it frustrates me to hell that i am unable to think the way i used to. she said that this was incorrect, though, which put me down a little bit because i thought i was coming closer to the root cause of my trigger for this i willness.	not depression

i struggle with attachment i have realised i am pretty bad when it comes to attachment, i meet people and sure we might get along, sure we might even become friends. but i never feel like they are a part of my life, there just here and i do not particularly care whether or not they stay. there has only been a few people i have ever became attached too and i can not i amagine living without them, but everyone else, even some of my best friends sure i like them but i struggle to really care about them. i do not know if its just because i am so used to being numb and alone it scares me to care, or if i genuinely just can not make attachments because i expect them all to break.	not depression
depressed people inti amidate me i had a friend who was severely depressed and also suffered from severe anxiety and panic attacks. i truly loved her but our relationship turned toxic very quick. she used to blame me for not being there for her enough and made me feel as though i was supposed to save her. i was her only friend and tried to be there as much as i could but it was never enough. it all ended in a big shitshow where she said i was the one who made her want to ki will herself and i guess it kinda traumatized me. now i have an another friend who is currently suffering from depression and it makes me stressed. i am scared i wi will end up in a si amilar place with this friend as i was with the other. i definitely do not want lose an another friend, please help me. how should i be there for my friend?	not depression
its been years, why can not i get over her? i am not trying to go too much in detail because i dont want to divulge in the idea of her so much, i will just end up feeling worse so here it is in short. was never a popular or fit guy got better socially and physically but sti will had mental problems from growing up and sti will do never had much hope finding a gf i feel everything in such a raw way that theres no filter hard for me to connect with people in the first place, even harder to genuinely vibe with them met a thisney princess of a girl with eyes like gold talked to months but felt like an eternity, like i knew her forever, never connected with someone like that in my life went on dates but feelings were overly intense already everything was perfect i am pretty sure i was the one that messed up, can never know for sure think she got scared because her last relationship ended badly ended abrubtly sent me into deep spiralling depression where i felt like i was dying, sobbing endlessly everyday, trying to get advice from every person i talked to or even never had before, just trying to get something that would make me feel any better or maybe it was just to vent gained pounds the next couple years can sti will never think badly of her or stop blaming myself or stop opening the wound with thoughts of her its been years, i just dont know what to do at this point. do you guys ever forget your first true love, something you feel like you might never have again just from how rare it was to happen in the first place? it was truly like seeing a unicorn, i am not exagerating. only thing that is kept me going is me trying to convince myself that i will be able to find someone like that again, no matter how many ti ames i say it, i never fully believe myself although i want to. i also like to think that theres another di amension out there where it worked with me and her, that at least one of me is happy. so that is where i am at right now. whenever i think of her i end up ruining my day and the next day at least, just opening up the wound and never having it fully heal. i know at least that i just wasnt ready to have a relationship with someone so good and i definitely, unfortunately, had to learn from it but i made sure of it i learned everything i could. not going to go through months of crying like a bitch for nothing. i honestly dont know where i am going with this, if anyone wants to relate and write there experiences, write any sort of advice, or just say same man, i feel you , please do. i dont know what i need anymore, just that even knowing someone for little more than a month can manhandle you into shambled however hard or however long it chooses. thanks for reading, cheers. tldr was a loner that feels too hard, met a unicorn, lost a unicorn, got big depresso	not depression

ria ciuffo. alexandra cooper. sofia franklyn. kayce smith. every woman on the show letterkenny. i want to attract women at that level but everyone tells me never going to happen so fuck. my. life here is a list of every woman who treated me badly or who rejected me and friend zoned me now you know how bad i have got it ashley girl i can not get over got married and she is in love with hi am and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves hi am and she wi will never love me. i am absolutely fucking depressed. i fucking hate hi am he ruined my life. i asked girls online if he is better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date hi am than me. can anybody give me advice that is beneficial for me? if you say if you really love her youd be happy for her or move on , that has no benefits for me it only benefits her pos husband. i do not get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending just fucked over. i told her my feelings she rejected me and she tried setting me up with a fat ugly girl after rejecting me. f k my life. i have the worst life possible alex my prom date who i had a crush on for years made out with another dude in front of me and ran off to f k hi am in his car and because she was from out of town she stayed over my place and the next morning after she invited hi am over so she can make out with hi am and in his car on my driveway amd people found out and i got humiliated all the way to graduation sara the girl i had feelings for in high school but who friendzoned me is getting married to a guy who is cheated on her with a teacher she started dating hi am when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman. hes an absolute scumbag. i truly hate hi am. he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and has been caught texting other girls with intent to cheat multiple ti ames. and now the girl i want is marrying hi am and a teacher herself she would use me as the shoulder to cry on and then when she was done crying to me she would have me go away and then she would go back to hi am after i am not saying it was not my own fault but to some degree i was used emotionally and now everybody is happy that they are getting married it is like i am living in the twilight zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. then five years ago when my mom passed away everybody i knew gave me their condolences even people i did not like but they sti will were decent enough to tell me their condolences except her she did not even give me a my condolences at the mini amum despite her feeding me lies saying how me and her were such close good friends. she could not even text me my condolences or sorry for your loss not even to words in a text. i go to therapy because of this experience. i then messaged her saying how it hurt me that she did not say anything i told her how i felt about her i told her that her boyfriend now fiance is a scumbag i told her she is dumb for staying with a scumbag like that and the last thing she ever told me was f k you loser sorry you re so mad at the world the week my mom died!!! last thing i ever said to her was how is that possible? i am not a scumbag who cheats on you. is not that what you prefer to f k? that was five years ago and we have not spoken since. the wedding was in july all my life women i have liked rejected me or ignored me. the only ti ame women liked me they were morbidly obese and extremely unattractive but then i would be told to give them a chance that is your league anyways at least they are nice girls being told to take an l with a smile is not a great life. especially if you compare her to the women who rejected me. their husbands and boyfriends who i loathe see that i am with a woman much less unattractive after being rejected by them gives them a whole lot of leverage over me and that is absolutely humiliating for me like haha my girl rejected you and you re stuck with an ugly woman. sucks to suck loser . that is humiliation defined, and everybody wants me to embrace this happening and it is not fair. i wi will be happy when a woman hotter than the women who rejected me loves me. until then, all i ever got was fucked over no lube or spit and then people tell me be happy for the people i hate. to just lie down and take it and that is fucking bullshit	not depression

what should i do? i feel like a friend of mine is contributing to my depression. he helps, loves, cares, and is there for me whenever i need it, but we both have feelings for each other. we know it and clearly show it to one another, but i feel this is leading me to being super clingy. i have gotten so used to the fact that if i feel bad that when he is not, i feel bad when he is not around. i hate this, since even though he though he gives me more help than anyone else, when he is not able to, depression begins to attack more. clearly this is not good, and maybe this is not even what is going on. this is just what i thought, and i was not sure what to do. i love hi am so much, but i need what is best for me. i do not want to hurt hi am and saying to hi am oh by the way i have become so attached to you that when you are not around i feel more depressed than usual . i feel like cutting hi am out is what is good for me now, but later once i have had ti ame to myself to pick myself up again , what would he think? i could not just go back to hi am after that. he would either be too hurt by me or too scared to hurt me again. i do not know what to do. we re extremely close friends and cutting hi am out would be the hardest thing for me to do, even if it it is what is best for me.	not depression

i think i lost my best friend so, we were friends from th grade. we even did college together. everything was good, we were in the final year in our college and i came into relationship. i introduced my friend to my love. i wish i should not have since he knew me better than anyone else, my girl and he became good friends. they used to talk about me alot. i mean like seriously, she used to ask hi am everything. and my friend was helping her in every decision where he should get involved. i mean there are some boundaries, right ? one day i was alone with my girlfriend and her phone was right in front of me. she went to the kitchen and i took her phone and used it for some ti ame. also read the message between my friend and girlfriend. we had our first fight. i was so mad and i had every right to be ! my friend was literally aware of the personal things between me and my girlfriend. he should have told me, after then i was having some trust issues. we broke up after months, i was pretty serious about this girl. thanks to my friend we ended up hating each other. lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt lt this was some background information gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt ever since the break up, my friend stood up against me and took her side. this made a dent in our friendship. nothing was same. i think i lost my respect ! and the fucked up part is that friend is now ignoring me but acts like i am the most i amportant part of his life. but i m guy who he is least concerned about. atleast be a man and have the courage to end things ! why do you even have to pretend you fucker ! this is affecting me, i am thisturbed by this. what should i do ? p.s. it was not my fault that we broke up	not depression

to all those late bloomers in life, i am right there with you. hi, my name is uni amportant but you call me j. i am years old, just turned on the th of february with no celebration to speak of or any friends to hang out with. i do not drive because of no license, i have no real education outside of my ged, and no training or ski wills i can practically use in a job setting besides typing really fast. i live with my mom in a brand new state that i am completely miserable in with zero friends. i am also , dollars in debt because my mom opened up several credit cards in my name to pay for bi will is without my knowing for years. to top all that off, i have not had sex in years nor had any sort of physical inti amacy with a woman in that ti ame. so yeah, i am rock fucking bottom. yet even with all of this, i sti will cling furiously to the future that i want to forge for myself. i want all the wasted years doing nothing, sadness, crippling anxiety and loneliness to all have meant something. i can sit here and blame my mother for all the years she abused me and broke my down into nothing or never pushing me... or i can blame myself and the fact i was depressed or that i got too comfortable in my sadness and never left. regardless, you can not fucking change yesterday. so sitting down and thinking about what is to blame is absolutely pointless. i want to achieve happiness and gain love because god damnit do i deserve it. i want what is mine with my own two hands. nothing wi will stop me from getting there, not even myself because boy can i be my own worst enemy. its about ti ame i change that and become my own bestfriend. its about ti ame i fucking finally change my stars and find my true north. if you re anything like me just know that you are not alone in your struggles. may you find the strength and motivation in yourself to move forward. it took me long enough to finally wake the fuck up but here i am. i am going to be going to college soon to become a certified medical assistant while working shitty mini amum wage jobs and from there, i wi will save up and one day become a registered nurse. if you made it to here, thank you for your ti ame and letting me scream into the echoing void. i love you and keep moving forward.	not depression

some answers so i was reading this book called breaking the cycle for my chronic porn addiction and one thing that stuck with me which the author said was that your tendancy to be alone is probably coming from trauma. one is tendancy to isolate hi am herself is a subconcious decision of the brain to protect the being when you consider everyone a threat. i am definitely not saying that we all are victi ams of the world. just maybe some of us are straight up narcissists who are not ready to negotiate a little bit to hold a relationship and want to be treated like a princess all the ti ame. the thing is most probably your condition is just unfortunate, your father left you, your sister molested you and you could not seek help, got bullied everyday,your bother was considered better than you, have a mental i willness, your best friend betrayed you, you re not capable of excelling at something or whatever it is. the reason i say unfortunate is because nothing was actually meant to happen to you, you just happened to be the one it happened to.you could come out of it but there is no guarantee or magic formula that could solve your condition. maybe if you control your every conscious decision to make your life better you could come out of it but some battle scars would sti will be left. i was trying to find all the answers but trust me there are none. it is what it is. constant rejection and betrayal in every field of life has made me totally numb which is worse than feeling depressed. i eat alone i stay alone the friends i had have taken a step ahead in their lives so it is just me now and it is not like i did not try. i tried hard. very hard. but i understand survivorship bias and it is not meant for everybody and again it is just unfortunate. i am writing this on a saturday night and i am a little drunk, just got rejected idk like the th ti ame called my friends up got the final vibe that i am not a part of their lives, failed miserably in an exam that i studied for. and my ocd has gotten worse. i am very afraid for tomorrow and the days to come if i wi will be able to stay with myself anymore. i do not know why i wrote this post ,maybe i wanted someone else to feel a little less lonely or maybe just to stop the sound of loneliness in my head. hope you do not end up like me. good luck.	not depression
my mom is my greatest burden even when i feel like i am doing better than usual my mom finds a way to guilt trip me and make me feel worse. she never acknowledges my accomplishments and whenever i try and talk to her she just gets really mad at me and makes me feel awful. she acts like she knows more about my situation than i do and basically thisregards anything i thisagree with her on by saying it is my brain playing tricks on me. she always says i never work for myself and tells me i need to be doing things differently even when i prove to her that her methods do not work for me. i am scared to confront her about this because whenever i do something she does not like she says i am ruining our relationship and that i just do not know anything. she refuses to take responsibility for anything and would not talk to me when i need her to. she refuses to believe that anything she does can have a negative affect on me even though she always clutches her pearls whenever i say something she does not like even a little bit. she likes to believe she does more to help me than i do. the truth is she has no idea what i am going through and probably thinks i am just faking it at this point. she denies any logic or reasoning i use to come to my conclusions just because she thinks something different and has no way of proving it. whenever i ask her to explain why what i am saying is false and what she is saying is true she just gets super mad and says stuff like we re not in a court of law or this is not a debate competition she refuses to acknowledge that basic logic and reasoning is required to make any clai am or deny any of mine. at the end of the day she wi will say or do anything that makes her feel like she is right and she is better than me and that i am wrong, and a worthless piece of scum that she can manipulate and have control over.	not depression
to those that have never shared themselves i dont think ive ever let anyone know everything about me , ive been doing it for so long , even i forget who i am or where ive come from someti ames. the sad reality is that everyone is probably doing the same , some more than others and its all down to our childhood. every human has that one thing about themselves that they cannnot say out loud even in a dark room , alone. mine is a long list , a list many i ammigrant children all share , this one thing or list can make us strong , weak , and many ti ames blocks our chance of love because it creates doubt , very long thoughts in our heads that pop up everyti ame we are alone , everyti ame we feel close to someone , everyti ame we are doing something to better ourselves , mine used to pop up in lecture halls , when applying for jobs or anyti ame i acheived something or just felt happy. for many its a thought that pops up late night in bed. you can not escape it because its forever stamped somewhere , your heart or head. i hope you find that one person that you can spi will it out to without a doubt in your head that they wi will leave you or see you in a different light after. i hope that you see it not as something that has fucked you up but something that the universe has once made a mistake on and that you can choose to not carry this mistake. i hope you get that one moment in your life where you let it go and ti ame stops for a minute and you know , you just know that youve returned that one thing that was once given to you by mistake straight back to the universe. i hope that one moment comes soon and you live your life . dont let ti ame and the ways of the universe beat you to it.	not depression

not speaking to anyone for plus on the weekends is becoming too much to bear. added in with the additional stress of the last year of college i do not know how i wi will cope. i am a year old male. i wi will be done college this year. on the weekend the landlord is not here. i absolutely dread the weekends. there is one other person in the house. a spanish exchange student. i never speak to her because of social anxiety. hell i can not even speak to most people without freaking the fuck out. i was relentlessly bullied in school and i do not speak to my parents. you can go look atmy post history if you want. i am often suicidal and i feel i am reaching tipping point. i have pains in my chest but it can not be linked to a physical cause. i have constant feelings of anger and death. for some reason looking at violence decreases violence in me which is why i go to gore website name . but even this is failing to have an affect at this stage. i was thinking of ways to ki will myself as i walked home today...miserable from the library. i have no friends well one friend who i barely hang out with because i am too scared to go out at night ti ame. and i feel too guilty to hang out with hi am during the day ti ame because i should be working. who said i should be working? my parents. this is a fucking pathetic post. what else am i to say? i feel like i am going insane. i was looking at a jordan peterson lecture and he said you need to have things not suffer as much. . an inti amate partner i have never had a gf. in fact i lost my virginity to a prostitute. . friends. friend for the ti ame being who i rarely see. in college i have one friend who is extremely religious and has narcissistic tendencies but at least he fucking listens to me. . a job i do not have a job. i tried to get one at christmas but i have never had a job wrong i had one job lasting months, it was a summer job . employers ask me about the employment. i was in fact trapped by the oedipes mother or whatever the fuck it is called. she never wanted me to leave but i am never coming back now. . i forget the rth and rth ones. i am so fucking fed up of living like this. i wan t human connection. i wan t human warmth. a few months ago i gave myself a concussion by slamming my head into the wall and ramming my first into my head. i dealt with post concussion syndrome for months after which eventually subsided around months after the incident. at that period i did not feel human, thissociated, angry. suicide is on my mind every day. it is all i think about. i wish it was not. i have a few months left to go before college is finally over. i am getting a degree in psychology. perhaps my interest in the subject stems from y fucked up childhood. i do not know. this is just a big rambling. i want love and affection. i have never had it and it is not a boo hoo poor me kind of thing. it is more an anger kind of thing. i was never allowed to be sad.	not depression
why am i feeling stress and thisgust instead of sympathy? i am a univercity student that studies it. i am , but sti will living with my parents. it is rather common in my country, as i think . we try to help each other at home. my mother is a nice, hard working, but very emotional person. she hates when other people are speaking in a loud voice. hates when people argue with her. it is very easy to make her hysterical. when she shouts or just speaks in a violent sarcastic manner i feel very, very stressful. for example, today she came home after a hard day at work and found an oil spot on her linen pajamas me and granny were cooking pancakes . she went into a scandal mode and ended up crying. she now sits and says that nobody likes her or cares about her. it is some kind of play called i wi will do all by myself because nobody cares about me and she acts like this alomst every ti ame when she is angry on us. of course, that is not true, because we care, but when she is in such a mood trying to calm her down or just touching her is dangerous she wi will likely insult you and would make you feel even more angry. i think that is why i started to avoid her in any ways possible when she suddenly changes her mood. i can feel by the way she closes the door or how she is cooking how she feels, and when something is wrong, fear mixed with thisgust overflows me and i try to hide inside my room. i know that avoiding her is horrible she is always working hard in a toxic collective and needs an emotional support. but i can not give her that support because even in case of minor mistake she wi will become angry and winll make herself and all the people around her to hate each other. i do not know what i am asking about how to comfort her or how to deal with psychological pressure. probably both. so... how to make her feel more comfortable without face to face contact? how to calm down after seeing all of that? i know that first question is egoistic, but i just can not do it. i am too afraid of making it worse.	not depression
i am getting all this support but i am sti will never happy before i start, this post is just my experience. i am not saying you should not tell anyone. it can really help, but in my situation, with my parents i knew it would end this way. i am sti will glad that i am starting therapy so please do not use this post as an excuse to keep your feelings bottled up. my mum makes me feel like i am very useless with her tone being really soft all of a sudden. and my dad constantly has this tone in his voice and the way he acts towards me suggests that i think of myself as some sort of hero or victi am in my story and that i need to just grow up and just act like nothings happening. this could not be further from the truth because i am aware that despite the fact i can not control it, i am sti will responsible for anything i do in this state and just because i have serious depression does not mean it is not my fault i dropped out of school, and hobbies, or how i ghosted all my friends, i know that i am sti will a stubborn piece of sh t and that despite hating myself more than anything i manage to sti will have a huge ego. but what i want hi am to know is that it works the other way around too, just because i am responsible for these does not mean that i am in control or that i have the physical capability of just changing in the snap of a finger, i want hi am to know that my is not the same as his and that he should not expect me to live up to these expectations just because he managed to.	not depression

i just want a hug my boyfriend recently broke up with me, and it is a bit hard trying to find someone else i am bi but the only people who want to date me are creepy guys . i am starting to fall back into that pit of desperation that i was in before me and my ex were dating. i have tried to hug people because i miss it so much and i just want human contact, but it is never enough. i do not want to touch my mom at all. one of my friends hugged me last week and it felt euphoric, but it only lasted less than five seconds before she kind of brushed me off and ran to her bus. i felt really sad for a while after that. another friend asked for a hug yesterday, i am guessing he needed the comfort because his dog is going to be put down today. i was expecting a long hug, but it was very brief. it lasted maybe a second or two before he turned to my other friend and hugged her for almost thirty seconds. then, as i was talking to one of my other friends, she was complaining about how she can never find anyone to date who wants to date her for longer than a week. she is but usually develops crushes on people who are not able to date her she had a crush on a year old and almost four year olds . she was ranting about her best friend and how she loves cuddling with her, and i just remember feeling really lonely. here she was complaining about how alone she was, meanwhile she has best friends she can turn to when she wants to cuddle. and here i am, too awkward to ask for a long hug but desperately needing one. i do not want things to go back to how they used to be, but it feels like they wi will tl dr i have been lonely since my breakup and i feel frustrated because whenever anyone hugs me which is not very often , it is very brief and leaves me even lonelier.	not depression

dealing with jealousy hey everyone! how do you deal with jealousy in a positive way? as a young professional, seeing others getting opportunities i was rejected from and advancing farther than me in their careers really brings me down. what are some strategies mantras that can help?	not depression
anxiety and depression are not part of you, emotional freedom is. emotions like anxiety and depression are just happenings within the space of awareness that you are these sensations can not define you, your true nature includes and goes way beyond this sensations we should not blame ourselves to feel anxiety or depression, the more we realize that every sensation is meant to be felt the more at ease we ll be able to be while experiencing them judging ourselves and try to change from a place of control and force would not work, true change can be realized only from a space of pure acceptance. so instead of blaming yourself and entering into a negative spiral allow to si amply accept those sensations by being close to them the more you ll accept the inner pain the faster you ll realize that it was all an i willusion and from there it wi will be clear to you that emotional freedom is all that there is and that wi will always be. answering all public and private questions 	not depression
why am i always questioning myself ? do not you know the feeling of being alone? well i definitely do. it is i amportant to me that everyone around me has someone to lean on. i am there ... always but none seems to care about my feelings... i actually do not know if anyone would care if i would die.... last ti ame i tried to ki will myself no one even noticed it.. why would anyone care this ti ame... is not ironically that i try to help other people with the same problems and do not know how to solve my own problems...	not depression
always second guessing. this world is nasty and people are not kind or supportive i am a gay man who has been pushed out of his own community because i am not outgoing or got the perfect body or style and can not hold a proper conversation or who is not bitchy enough i just do not know what to do anymore. i am yo and i am finding it harder and harder as life goes on, i seem to be failing at everything that i do. work, relationships. friendships. cooking, everything. i secretly suffer with social anxiety and find it very hard meeting friends and building relationships that last. i find it hard making conversation and get in my head about what to talk about and can not relax into any conversation. i feel that i do not know enough about the world or popular subjects and therefore am uncomfortable adding value to any conversation so avoid as much as possible and i even struggle with small talk. truth be told i do not think i have anything in common with most. i can never remember anything and since a child have never retained information easy i can watch a film or read a book and then be asked what it was about and have no idea atall. i am a workaholic and love keeping busy but people are not into it as much as me and put me down to the point where i second guess myself all the ti ame. am i doing to much am i doing this right, why does none get this or is it me. i am made to feel like i am not wanted in any environment that i work in because other people do not want to put in as much as i do and i even have people causing issues for me and because i can not communicate properly it always comes back to bite me on the arse. i currently have gone into a team off people that have since before i started taken a thislike to me and every ti ame i am in i am being told that i am doing this wrong i am doing that wrong when i know it is right but it is because they do not want to do it. my relationship has been for years but feels more like convenience than a relationship as we are not close and we know that we can not afford to live if we are not together so is more of a housemate situation with occasional sex. i can not cook to save my life and i ruin every meal and thispute trying my hardiest to i amprove just can not get it right and i am made to feel like i am usless at every attempt. am i the only person out there that feels like this .	not depression
i have no interesting title in years, i did not get into a med school, my bf broke up with me, of my cats died, i live with my parents. i am a university drop out and i used to be the straight a student. my family changed its behaviour towards me when i did not get into the med. i do not speak with my best friend, who i also love. basically, i have no friends, future or anything. the only thing that keeps me from a suicide are my cats and the fact that i save stray cats. i tried to get into therapy sessions but all the psychologists either did not respond or rejected me due to overflow of patients. i tried learning swethish. i am currently in english classes and i consider quitting. i am trying martial arts. already tried yoga classes, ballet, gym... everything. nothing works for me. i miss my friend. we used to talk and have a good ti ame. we used to go on trips. now i just see hi am online and he does not write me. i am tired of all of this. it breaks my heart when i think of hi am being with someone else. everyti ame i tell hi am about my problems he tells me to go find a psychologist or do something with myself. when i tell hi am that i am sorry that he feels that way when he tells me his feelings he flips and tells me that i am thismissive over his feelings... he tells me i am chilthish... he does not want to communicate the problem further because i am hard to communicate with. i am unable to learn because i instantly forget everything or do not remember it the next day. i used to be this beast able to learn anything anyti ame. i even started to bite my nails again, have nightmares and so on. training does nothing to me, as if i was unable to feel the oxytocine. what the hell is this life about...?	not depression

what is wrong with me i really dont know if it is depression, i just think my mental health in general is getting so much worse. last night, i had this thought of what if your friends and boyfriend are hanging out without you? and then it kept getting worse, i thought they hated me and i was convinced i would end it all. i kept going from having so much sadness to just staring emotionless at my eyes in the mirror. i feel fine today, i am just not sure what is going on or why i feel like this.	not depression

helping people is amazing recently i have been feeling really, really sad, and i have no one to talk to. decided i wi will go on omegle to talk to anyone. originally i went to tell other people about my problems but i ended comforting others about there is. when they say thanks after comforting them is fucking amazing. or just knowing i made their day a little better, it makes me forget about the other things that go bad.	not depression
to be so emotionally damaged your brain no longer processes it i apologize if thisi s the wrong sub for this if there is one that it would fit better on, please say something, but i want to know what mental traits i do not want to call them i willnesses or thisorders cause a person to be completely unable to process mental or emotional trauma. for example, i am writing a story, and my character has a flaw where she undergoes something mentally or emotionally stressful, and any ti ame she experiences feelings of guilt, remorse, or shame, she feels a mass of....something building up in her chest, and where as a normal person might have a very emotional reaction such as crying, screaming in anger at someone, giving a tearful apology, something very emotional, very dramatic, she just...does not. her brain i ammediately thisengages and puts her on autopilot, and she wi will remove herself from the situation quickly yet calmly, then go into the next room or, if possible, her bedroom and start doing some mundane task and thinking about the task, not about the emotionally harrowing event that happened five minutes prior. her brain just acts as if it did not happen. to give an example, let us say you found out your mother was very badly injured in a car accident and you have an amazing relationship with your mother, just wanted to say this because the last ti ame i tried to use this example, people were like well i hate my mother so i would celebrate lmfaooooo and right when you re about to cry or scream or freak out or have a meltdown, you just...leave the room. and as you re leaving the room, you remember you have clothes in the drye, so you autopilot into the laundry room and take the clothes out, start folding them, then go put them away, and your brain does not process anything about if your mother is okay, almost as if you never found out about the car accident. my question is, what mental trait s cause this in a person? if there is an actual mental i willness or thisorder that covers it, what is it called? anyone who can relate, can you if it is not too triggering, of course share a ti ame when you had a si amilar thisconnect and what you felt when if your brain finally processed the information, for better or for worse?	not depression
i am really lost removed 	not depression
i am not okay so i have not been doing good lately. i have not been doing good since valentine is day. to explain a little i have to back up. i have been trying to get approved for weight loss surgery since last year, its taken months to get all approvals, sleep doctor fucked me up, she never scheduled the sleep test and by the ti ame it was .scheduled, . the test was done and . the results were in, it had taken months. it was supposed to happen august , it did not happen ti will october so i did not get my cpap until nov. th and it takes wks for approval. they pushed me back months due to work and because tbh they suck even though everything was clear. i did not get my surgery date until about a month ago. that is when things started to get worse. i had to go on a liquid diet which is hard mentally and physically. and i was doing it all alone. my father told me he was going to do a partial liquid diet with me only drinking them at night so i did not have to be around fast food junk food and when he was cooking stuff i can not touch. that did not happen. so i had to deal with his shit for wks. then surgery day came. i was alone. you see when you go in for surgery you can have someone wait for you, and all your shit if you brought anything for afterward and then come see you either in recovery or in your private room. dad decided not to do any of it. he decided work was more i amportant and got mad at me because clearly i was upset and was not going to beg hi am to stay. well, i get thru surgery, no complications, i feel like shit which is expected. i got to my room, i text people and whatnot. and well. my friend tried to visit but she got sick so naturally, she can not come into a hospital into a medical ward that has people who just had surgery. that is just completely not possible. so by the ti ame she felt better she had work. side note i was in the hospital about . days. so friday to monday. this is i amportant i had no on visit me i was not expecting anyone to show up the day of surgery because i was asleep on and off ti will pm surgery was at am . but saturday came and i figured okay my friend can not come but dad surely wi will visit his only known child in the hospital right?... right? nope. i saw no one except nurses doctors etc no one visited none of my other friends drive, and the hospital is a drive for most people okay fine surely he wi will come sunday, he would not just not visit his daughter after her first major surgery as an adult right? i live with hi am, just to be clear he did not visit. at all. i got a few nice texts that is it. he did not tell me why he did not visit or give excuses until the next day when he decided i was not more i amportant than work yet again. i was thischarged by pm he did not get me until pm. apparently no one would cover his part of the job, and he wouldn t just be straight up and say i need to go get my daughter from the hospital i wi will be back. all i needed was maybe hrs of his ti ame. to get me home and then he could go to work again. nope. his excuses as to why he did not visit was that he could not leave the bathroom all weekend, which means he did not take his meds correctly which he does often and could not leave because he was constantly using the bathroom. note i had a private bathroom he could use as needed. that was his excuse, there were rest stops on the way, there was ways to get to the hospital. he decided that i was not worth enough to do so. that started the depressive episode, and it is sti will getting worse daily. after surgery, i was unable to go to therapy for at least a week, because healing, then it turned into i am demanding you make both of our appointments because i do not want to do it . we see different therapists, he is going bi weekly i go weekly they rarely have the same days. i had struggled to get to the office via phone, and when i did i said fuck this i wi will make my own he is a grown man he can do his own. i can not see my therapist until the th. it wi will be nearly a month since i last saw her. and each day makes it worse. i finally got thru the nd portion of the liquid diet, now i am on pureed, and its sti will so hard. because i am the one trying to go by the book on what i can safely eat. is it on the pureed allowed food list? no? then no you can not eat it. yes? okay good how to make it taste good without adding extra shit. and i am sti will doing it alone, dad swore he would support me and help me, and what does he do? bring more and more fast food in, junk food and ice cream i can not touch i can have sugar free popsicles. that is about it, same with sugar free jello pudding but he brings in things like mega fries, or wings, or chinese, stuff i love but i can not touch now, and maybe ever. or he cooks a huge batch of chili taco meat and again, its to solid for me, that is soft food stage, i got wks before that is allowed. he is been told, he just does not care. so each day it is making harder to keep to the diet. i try to ask for help and i am shot down, i get told no that is not allowed but it is in the book i was given on the stage given! i am trying so hard to keep to the diet, to ignore my cravings while actually sti will eating. i get sick if i do not eat, if i eat, i get sick. i can not drink anything for an hour after i eat. and i can not seem to get any support, from anyone except a few friends. and that hurts. i have been pushing my self harder than i should because if i wait for dad, i would never get to the store and then i am rushed because he wants to leave. i can not do that when i need to look at stuff and check labels. this surgery is not a quick fix, i am a little over wks post op and i am struggling. and i feel so alone. i see the scale going down, and it barely makes me happy. i have started not to feel anything. and that scares me, i am falling into old habits which is not good, thankfully not food related but that is backtracking into a person i do not want to be. i sti will feel guilty for buying needed items, stuff like panties i feel guilty about. i feel so fucking alone and i can not dump this on my friends, it is not fair to them, it is not fair that i have to feel this way and that my only living parent sucks so badly. i can not do anything, i am terrified to go out, i could not even push myself to get into the shower and wash my hair and deknot it! and its sad looking li amp, lifeless and full of knots and tangles, and my hair is thin so it is bad i want to have a life again, this surgery was supposed to help me do more, my weight was stopping me from doing so much and i need to do more for once. and i can not bring myself to do it. i have to really wait until wks are up so i am fully healed from everything and i can go to the gym, and get back to work and do more. but i am not able to right now. right now in a sense, i am chained to the house, driving takes to much out of me, going to the store tires me out. i just want to be happy. and i know therapy wi will help because i got the news i can move after wks i can not afford it, i am living off my tax refund right now it is that bad but it is so hard to be happy anymore...because li amited to nothing makes me happy anymore.... i just feel so damn alone anymore and i do not know what to do.	not depression
i might be a different person if it was not for my dad i was when my dad left. i did not know hi am. and like most kids i blamed myself. by the ti ame i was five i had already experienced trauma. and by th grade my mother believed i had severe shyness but my psychiatrist said it was social anxiety. i waited years and years for my dad to come back into my life. all i got was excuses in phone calls. hi am blaming my mom for why he was not around. then my brother was diagnosed autistic and i became like the other parent looking out for hi am. i grew up fast. and had few friends. i got bullied alot. the stress grew on me. by i had a stomach ulcer i woke up at am with the worst stomach ache the lights were di am in the bathroom and i was in the tub and puked over the edge and my mom woke and noticed a large puddle of blood.. we rushed to the er. where i kept getting sick. my stress has not ever really been the best and i never really blamed anyone. it was not my mom is fault my dad was not a better person and my mom needed all the help she could get. by the bullying caught up and i had my first suicide attempt. and it spread in school. i was that weird girl no one talked to but looked down upon. my teachers grew worried and wanted to include me somehow. the problem was the club they got me in i could not stay in cause things were hard at home and my brother who was years younger was having a hard ti ame. highschool was agonizingly slow. i graduated. no dad there. i had begged hi am two years prior to come see me in which he said, you fought with me and said you hated me. why would i reward you with coming? if you hate me ? i think all of my friendships suffered and relationships. i am dealing with chronic i willnesses and i just wanted a better father in my life. i am turning ..i got diagnosed with alopecia areata..a rare thisease called eosinophilic colitis and just keeps telling me , sorry kid if you had my genetics you wouldn t be so sick. i hope you get better soon or i hope the doctors bring your hair back. but very little conversation unless i force it. i wi will always feel like i am waiting for the pain inside to go away. why is that ? why is not my family enough?	not depression

anyone else really struggle with bottling your emotions to an extreme extent? removed 	not depression
i wish i did not feel so ashamed for not having a passion maybe i am surrounding myself with the wrong types of people for me, but i am tired of feeling like an outcast for feeling meh about life. it seems like everyone has at least some sort of passion that they work towards. from a dream career to creating a family of their own, there is something that gives them an enthusiasm for getting the chance to exist. meanwhile, even in my best ti ames, i struggle to see what the big deal is. even if i can come to enjoy my ti ame on this earth, if someone were to ask me if i would rather have not been born, i would say yes without a doubt because there si amply is not a point. i refuse to tell many people this because they would look at me like i am an alien. i wouldn t even call myself depressed right now, considering the episodes i have had in the past. i would say currently, i am only logically depressed. what i mean by that is while i am sti will thinking the same thoughts i did when i was actually depressed, they are not hitting me emotionally in the same way they would in a vulnerable state. and i am very thankful for that. but it is admittedly kinda sad that even when i am not emotionally depressed, my brain sti will does not find life worth living.	not depression
just wanted to give everyone here a thank you it may seem weird thanking people for their depression but since i have thiscovered this subreddit i have felt so much better and so much more opti amistic about getting through life. knowing that there are actually people out there that understand what i am going through and better yet can help me understand what my mind is experiencing is just such a relief. i have been to therapists and it is nice to have someone to vent to but it is a short lived relief. i would leave and be like that was nice, onto this weeks mental break down. everyone here just wears their hearts on their sleeves and as vulnerable as that is, you dont realize how much of a difference you could be making to just one person or multiple. big or small, its something. i always felt alone and this subreddit helped me feel... like i am not. yeah we dont get together and do lunch but we share something deeper than friends who do. thank you guys for being here, for me, and for eachother. love you depressed weirdos. keep your head up. i might not always be able to help or understand, but i am always here for any of you.	not depression

my ex girlfriend is the only person i have right now. me f and my girlfriend f broke up two weeks ago. it was all my fault. i was so insecure and i felt so lonely even with her. i hurt her so much for the last six months and we fight a lot. i was so selfish, i can not even think how she feels about my actions. i am in therapy for eight months and i figured out that my actions were a consequence of the bad relationship i have had with my parents. yesterday i talk with my ex and decided to cut ties and stop talking. i did not feel anything after that. but today i talk with my therapist about it and i feel extremely sad. i feel so guilty for everything and i hate myself because she does not deserve this at all. i feel so bad right now and i try to talk with a friend but she does not understand me, so i decided to text my ex and she is coming to see me. i do not know what to do, i feel extremely lonely right now.	not depression
staring blankly ahead hi! so i f have suffered from depression and anxiety plus ptss, but that has been well treated since i was years old. recently i have been experiencing a mild relapse, but i realised that, when i am getting worse, i just... tend to stare blankly ahead? so one moment i am in the middle of a conversation, the next moment i realise that i have been staring ahead into nothing. this can be in combination with worrying and thinking, but someti ames i am not thinking about anything and my mind just goes blank. i can kind of feel it in my eyes when it happens i lose focus . does anybody else experience this? or maybe have an explanation about what it could be? i am not sure if it is useful to thiscuss with my psychologist...	not depression

coping with job loss hi all, recently was let go from a job a few weeks back. this was extremely sudden and unexpected. i had not been happy there but was a good worker who put my all into my work. i took a trip and filed for unemployment and i also have a part ti ame that is keeping me afloat. recently so thought everything was in place but i received a letter today for a re evaluation for unemployment which sent me into a spiral. i absolutely can not make ends meet without it and although my job stated in writing they wouldn t contest unemployment due to the circumstances i am terrified. i have found myself becoming depressed and listless. i have had certain pockets before or crisis ti ames but they all seem to alleviate with some hard work and exercise. however i am finding myself drowning suddenly in anxiety and panic. i have had anxiety attacks return suddenly, i can not seem to sleep and yet i have no motivation to get out of bed. it is been a struggle the last few mornings to really push myself to do anything. i get sudden shocks of listlessness and i feel totally thisconnected. i have been sitting interviews and submitting applications like crazy but each we have decided to go in a different direction stings. i have thought about embracing my hobby which is travel and maybe starting a travel blog but when i get on the computer etc i just sit there and lose track. i have never had an episode hit me this hard before. i very recently got into a relationship with a supportive boyfriend but it is really making me withdraw from hi am. i feel bad and guilty that he has to deal with this so new into our relationships. my friends also have kinda seemed to just moved on after me telling them. i find myself drinking a lot more than i used to secretly and this is also scaring me. my benefits just ran out so i have no access to healthcare or anything until medicaid comes through. i absolutely do not know what to do. does anyone have any advice on the light at the end of the tunnel? on staying motivated and not panicking? any help or tips would be appreciated because every day is becoming more and more of a struggle.	not depression

could use a little boost, doing my best to not fall apart bit by bit. i go to school, i am taking multiple classes, and it is starting to get overwhelming. i am doing average in all my classes and it is starting to get just a bit worse. i do not want to go back to that place where i would sleep all day but just yesterday i spent almost twenty hours asleep. i live alone, with my two birds. i take better care of them than i take care of myself. it may be a little odd but just some si ample words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. i am only but i have come so far from self harming, being abused in treatment to living alone, being now clean from self harm for five years, and at least managing a sleep schedule. my sleep schedule has been absolutely fucked lately and while i am well rested, it is becoming an avoidance method. i am going to do some homework at the moment to hopefully offset the load and help feel better.	not depression
my mom is trying to ki will me what do i do? my mom has been abusing me for atleast tho weeks now. she constantly lies and insults me. i only saw her every few days but now it appears she is not coming here anymore but now she keeps sending police to my house to harass me. i have a record because i went to jail for having less than a gram of weed on me when i was i am now but that alone proves the police wi will not help me and are going to treat me like some heroin addict. i dont know what to do i have nobody else to talk to my mom is the only person i know in real life. i am terrified they could come back at any second. i can not sleep because that is too risky i can not even barely ever leave my small pantry i am hiding in everyday with my dog. atleast i wi will know of somebody is here thanks to my dog even if that means they are going to murder me and my dog. i am going to run out of food soon and i have no idea what to do then, i am already rationing it but its hard. all i can do is read to not sit here doing nothing and i only have a few books. please help me i know i am going to be dead soon and i do not want to die. my mom is severely mentally i will she doesnt have any friends or anything either so maybe that is why shes always tried to treat my life like a game or something. if i leave my hiding spot i can see around my house for the most part if that could help. i am thinking my only hope is to make an escape attempt someti ame in the night atleast my dog wi will not get murdered too hopefully when the police break into my house. i have duffle bags and shit but no car my mom would never let me have something like that. any advice is welcome but i hope this wi will not just get deleted. i am alone and scared and probably going to be dead soon	not depression

why do not i want to be here anymore? my mom has spoken about suicide since i was young, so i think i have just learned it from her. i have a girlfriend and a family that loves me, but i have always been different and have never found my place. i am right now and really just want answers more than anything. i have held jobs and can be self motivated, but i feel that if i had the choice to live or not at any given moment, i would choose not to. i do not know if it is chemical or if it was learned but it is so hard to be happy. if anyone has any experience or reliable resources for this please let me know.	not depression
the reason i stopped drinking. a story. it is about to be march. last year i moved because the stress of where i was living. got to the point where my self destructive nature flared up. almost a year at my new local. in this last move i lost all but one person in my support network. i try and respect the fact that he has a life outside of my problems. do not get me wrong we watch eachothers back. he is doing great for hi amself. i try not to drag hi am down with me. i properly interact with, maybe people outside of family. when it comes up in conversation. people ask me, why do not you drink? bad experience, or what? i keep my depression hidden from everyone including my family. my mom does not know. my sister has an idea but not how bad it really is. i do not even talk about it to my dad. he is super old fashioned, really religious. i made the mistake of drinking today. two beers that is all it took. everything came flooding back to me. it felt like i was an addict on relapse. i tried occupying myself with cleaning. my go to for the past three years. did not stop it. here i am on reddit again... it is like a sick game of having to relive the worst moments of your live, there is no pause button. i do not have the funds for a therapist i move around too much to actually have one anyway. between the depression, stress and concussions my memory is absolutely terrible. someti ames i wake up and have no idea where i am. other ti ames i have to force myself to get out of bed. it was not as bad as it is now. i used to talk to my grandmother. she was my stone. the only person that truly listened to what i had to say. even if it was stupid stuff. she passed away april . i can not recall the last conversation we had. i do not remember her voice or the way she used to look. i had to carry her ashes from california to nebraska. after it was all said and done i was thisowned. a year later i found out. the reason i was in foster care at yo. this is what haunts me. this is what lurks in the shadowy recesses of my mind. i was born in texas. my mother and father had forbidden love my dad is side of the family did not like my mom because she was a white girl. so they left texas when i was one. my mom is family did not like my dad because he was hispanic regardless of legality. they ed my dad because they ran the sheriff is office. a few years later they reported my mom to child protective services. at yo i was in foster care. a crowded one in wyoming. my sister and i slept on the floor. i gave half my food to her because she was always hungry. my mother won the case. but, if she did not. her family would have adopted my sister and left me in the system. all my life i had taken back seat to my sister. i have never once been upset with her over it. she was allowed to do just about anything. i was hidden away as if i was some thisfigured runt. my mother has a thing for racist guys, they fit in real well with the rest of her family. i took it upon myself at a young age to help, support, and protect my elder sister. i have been through hell and back. i have been making her look good by comparison for so long. that when i start to do good for myself. my mother and her s.o. are shocked that i could even do whatever. it put a lot of strain on our sibling relationship. i have a few nice scars, reminders of what i have done to myself in the past. i attempted suicide a few ti ames. i have one scar that goes around my whole body. that was the last attempt. back in idk . i have to see it every ti ame i look in the mirror. after that attempt i was under survei willance. by my support network. after three personal attempts and multiple attempts by other people i would kick the hornet is nest i can now say i am hard to ki will. my dad says it is because god has a plan for you yet. but, i stopped believing in god in foster care. idk, i feel like my entire existence is perverse. like i do not belong in this reality. as if by some crazy fluke here i am. the crazy thing is, is that i have always felt that way. most days i can just shrug it off and keep myself busy. but when i drink it comes with a vengeance. having typed all this out, i do feel marginally better. or at least well enough to go about my day. without being the something y.o. dude at the verge of tears because two beers brought back every bad memory of a sub par life.	not depression
question i am sorry if this is a rude question, but if you feel sad someti ames for no reason, is that depression? that is what google said and i am really confused, sorry if this is rude	not depression
do i have fake or real friends? hey, really hope i get a reply. i am a yo boy and i am very antisocial, i do not know how to act with people but once i get to know someone i become very talkative. ok so, i have been in the same school since kindergarten, i have been bullied because i used to walk alone and because i used to play with girls, the same bullies stayed in the same school for years, i tried becoming friends with them but they are just toxic and they really hurted me, no one tried to become friends with me except for some girls, but then they would just leave me for another friend, i thought it was my fault and i sti will think it is my fault, i open up to people pretty quick and then i like to be my true self... so i met this girl in grade and she was pretty awesome i like her and we re sti will friends til today, now i am in a group of friends and she is in it the group was made in school, it was first made of people without me, they had a social media group and they kept making plans without me even tho i was always around them, last year i was finally added to the group and i was finally invited to parties etc, i was happy but there is this guy in the group and he used to bully me when he started school he joined our school in grade , he did not like me and he thought i was annoying, i did not mind hi am in the group, we used to fight but now i am nice with hi am. he sti will hates me but i gave up on trying to get hi am to like me. hi am, along with many boys at school used to make fun of me and they used to say that i am gay because i do not play football, and do not do what normal boys do. i am not going to get into the fights that i had with the group but yesterday someone found my instagram bio, it was ceo of depression and yessir, they screenshotted it and sent it on the group making fun of me, i liked the bio and it was just me doing what i like, then they started making fun of me, i am not american and our first language is not english. so i just deactivated my instagram and my twitter cause they did not like my tweets, my best friend that i mentioned i talk with her a lot and she was like just ignore them but she never defends me in front of them, she always does it privately, is she a real friend? does she care about me?	not depression
i am appalled at the lack of justice in this world how could god allow this? the eternal question. i do not even believe in god only a figure of speech. how can nature devise itself to be so cruel and unforgiving. what lessons are we to learn from all this suffering? fuck your fucking lessons and your purpose god! you piece of shit. this is not correct. it can not be. there must be something i am not understanding	not depression
feel in a fog wow. today has been quite a day, and i am so ready for it to be tomorrow. let me start by saying that i am a thirty year old woman, and i have never truly classified myself as depressed before october . my ex and i broke up at the end of the month, and things have been very rough for me since, but i have pulled through and most days are good days even though i know i want back what i can not have, and i am working on not thinking those thoughts . today however, i woke up in a fog, but sti will managed to get out of bed, showered, and dressed nicely as i had to do a few things this morning. however i did not feel myself. and by the end of the hours, i was exhausted mentally, physically, and emotionally. so much so that i came home and just sat in the shower and cried for about minutes. i have convinced myself that my mirena iud is causing my depression as i get really low once a month, and that i wouldn t have had these arguments with hi am, mood swings, etc if it weren t for it. idk if this is true or not, but i can not be thinking like this. we broke up, regardless of the arguments, i did not want to convert to judaism, or pare down my holiday celebrations and that was why we broke up. who cares what else happened. today though i looked at his social media for the first ti ame in a month, and now i am back to feeling broken, depressed, and just a mess. and i am crying again. i can not really talk to anyone about this, as they wouldn t understand and would wonder why i am sti will hung up on hi am so many months later, and why i am so emotionally weak. i am not like a suicide risk or anything in case anyone was concerned, but i definitely do not know how to fix this. and it does not help that i just realized i have hours of online class homework to complete by tomorrow at midnight, and i can not even think to read the textbook, write the paper, answer the questions, etc.	not depression

my ingrained question and response hello, this is nothing to big. it is just that i f have this little scenario that plays in my head whenever i am not at work on assignments for school. i feel it is a problem, but how can i get what has been memorized perfectly out of my unforgetful mind. it is goes like this is there anything you want to do? besides ki willing myself? it is a small little dialogue that plays in my head like a record. maybe it is not too good for me to have such a thought repeating in my head, but it is. i just wonder if it is why i am the way i am.. sorry.	not depression

i am an idiot for taking this path.. if i knew that i was loved and cared for, this shit wouldn t have happened. ever since i have had depression, i have become really lazy. i do not do things on ti ame because i feel too scared that i may mess it up or i feel that i have too much to do. i am exaggerating way too much, this usually then leads to me thinking i wi will never be as good as other people in the world who are so successful. and i have to be honest, it is really true. why do i feel i have so much on my shoulders? i wi will never be able to follow my role model is path and i know it. then comes my sleeping schedule. i am not so much of an early bird, i usually read at night. but i can not even focus because of the thoughts that fuck me up. i feel too insecure about myself and i just can not even focus. i normally then wake up not wanting to get out of bed for some reason. with these thoughts, i just can not do anything. i want to die but i fear that the people around me who actually care about me wi will be devastated without me in the world. i wish i was someone else. someone popular. someone smart. someone who has a good schedule. someone who has everything a person could wish for. i am just so greedy and jealous. i think everything in my life should be perfect when others are dealing with things way more serious than my problems. i am also very scared about opening up about my sexuality. i know there are lgbtq but i do not feel opening up to anyone about it. i have heartbroken twice and that is pretty much what made me fear opening up about my sexuality. with my eating patterns, i just can not find the strength to eat enough. i am also afraid i wi will gain too much weight or lose too much weight. so i keep forcing my self to at least eat something, but it is just not working. i feel thisgusted at myself. i am such a thisorganized, selfish, jealous and cold hearted bitch.	not depression

girlfriend broke up with me this week i had a very bad depressive episode and my girlfriend and i were very thistant. thursday night, i was by my lonesome and decided to tell her i would go to therapy again and put in another consistent effort. she said how proud she was of me and how great i was. our relationship up to this point was quite good. i figured we d reconnect on the weekend. the next day she was avoiding me and my texts and once she came over, she said that she wanted to take a break because she has a lot of unsettled issues with her family and she hates her job. on top of this, she was going to start therapy as well. i pleaded with her that we could work through it and we had been together for over a year. i really thought with both of us attempting to i amprove individually would even benefit the relationship but she said that she needed the break. she was scared of being codependent and i get it because after all we re in our early twenties but i wanted more ti ame with her. i lost my best friend and am in the dumps and have no one to talk to. i went to her house yesterday and we spoke and i think the break is just a break up now. i just wanted to get better with her.	not depression

struggling through school, first serious break up.... i am in my nd year of vet school in a city far away from home. i have made some close friends but am really struggling. i am failing my first class ever after a terrible exam performance. i often feel overwhelmed and am very anxious about if i have what it takes to be a vet. i used to pride myself on my intelligence but since vet school, i have felt very stupid. i notice i do not look forward to hands on surgical labs like most students in my class and get super anxious at first to do them makes me feel sick but that feeling does pass a little once i start. i know if i had the chance, i would go back and pick a different profession as i fear my love for ani amals is si amply not enough. i feel stuck at this point and am in k of debt so i feel like i must finish and pursue this career. to make matters worse, i had my first serious break up today with the first guy i ever slept with. i had always been so school career driven i never let anyone close, but i took a chance. we broke up because he admitted to me he had started frequently smoking weed which he knew i was against from the start. he tried to quit smoking but only lasted a few days and says it helps with his depression but it makes me very uncomfortable. he also struggles with depression and told me it was either lose me or lose his head so i broke it off. it was only few months but as he was my first real relationship, it is made me very sad.	not depression

feeling down i have tried to write here a lot, but keep deleting it. i wi will have some good days more often than not lately, but when i have my off days i am really low. i feel sick, and unmotivated, i feel worthless like no matter what i do this is just how i am. i bite my nails which just makes me put myself down more and feel like it would not get better. i would not talk to my fiance, or even really play with my daughter, on my way to pick my fiance up, i thought about veering into oncoming traffic. i can not stand this bipolar bullshit. why is it so hard to be happy some days?	not depression
what are your coping mechanisms? my therapist had me think of some strategies to cope during the ti ames where the anxiety and depression take over, although i really was not able to come up with anything of substance. i do not have any vices that i turn to such as alcohol drugs and my main coping strategy is to stay in bed, which never actually helps. i am curious to hear of your coping mechanisms and how they make you feel in ti ames of depression. please share if you are comfortable doing so, thank you!	not depression

i am so lonely i do not know if anyone is actually going to read this, but i have just been so lonely lately and it is making my depression worse. i can not really leave my home for health reasons, and there has not really been anyone here lately. i do not want to keep bothering my friends by asking them to come over all the ti ame, and my boyfriend is too tired after working to come over and visit. i have my pets with me but it is not the same as taking to a person. or even being in the same room as someone. i am just not sure what to do at this point. texting just is not the same as having someone physically with you.	not depression

people are a parasite sorry for long post this post is just used for venting and letting out anger, all of my personal problems and just problems in society stem from the greed or manipulation of other human beings. the last thing i would ever want to do is let people think i am perfect or can not cause any wrongdoing, but at least i can acknowledge my faults and live with it. the problem with our society is nobody knows how to be human anymore. nobody accepts that their not perfect, nobody thinks about the person behind them waiting in line or that homeless guy trying to use the bathroom at the subway your eating at. nobody can take action for the problems they cause to themselves and the others around them. i am just so tired of this constant do not trust anybody but yourself attitude because people seem to feel that we re sti will living in ancient ti ames. i have already wanted to die for a long ti ame but after coming to this conclusion it is just starting to skyrocket even more then it is now. if i did not have my family id be dead right now. i know i can not do anything to really stop the pain so i just sit around all day with a lodged knife just sitting into my heart and i have already given up on the human race	not depression

people are a parasite sorry for the long post but i just wanted to vent almost all of my problems stem from other people, nobody really knows how to be human anymore. nobody thinks about that person waiting behind them in line or that person outside of the bathroom needing to use it, nobody knows how to be considerate to the people around them and have geniune respect for themselves and the people around them. i have wanted to die for a long ti ame but i can not because i could not let my family go through that pain. the worst feeling of all is already taking more pain than you can handle and not being able to not take that pain away for good. it is like living with a knife lodged in my heart and every day it is just finding a new way to become thisappointed. i have never clai amed or wanted to tell people i am perfect, because really i am not, but it just seems like nobody really knows the bad affect their having on themselves and the people around them.	not depression

people with depression annoy me pls read k i have said this before to people without any means to troll or whatnot. i just want to express my opinion but people do not want to accept my opinion or attempt to thiscuss it with me, really. honestly i feel like if i am open enough to my own idea that goes against of what society says, i can be open to someone changing my mind bringing info to alter my perspective. so maybe the title is misleading. maybe it is not. i can not really tell but what i know is that i honestly can not stand hearing all these sob stories from people with depression....or what i like to say... depression. see i do believe mental i willness is a thing. it is not anything set in stone because sure you can have underdeveloped parts of your brain and shit, but its all just a cluster of symptoms that wi will never be set in stone because all these diagnosis are made up just like anything else in the world, really. but anyway i am sure we have all heard, or have all complained about, people who are so fucking nagging and sad all the ti ame and attention seeking. i mean technically i am attention seeking at this moment because i am searching for replies and reactions from anyone reading this post. and my title was definitely attention grabbing because i can guarantee i caught the attention of many pre teen girls or boys and many also respectable women and men, who may or may not be mature and knowledgeable too . and no one can really stand them unless they are bsing themselves or are that exact person. but i am talking people who are depressed in general... the thing is, i am a total fucking hypocrite for this shit. i am literally diagnosed with depression anxiety otber thisorders that i do not want to mention because i am afraid that there are some kids in here who wi will actually go research it and be like omg i have that too and have had my stays in hospitals, self harm, therapists, psychiatrists, suicide attempts, etc. blah blah. nothing new. but seriously i can not hear someone talk about sadness and depression without wanting to roll my eyes. i mean i know how terrible i am sounding but i do want to warn yall that i do not excerpt this energy in real life. i am very easygoing and friendly irl. i mean i think it might be because i have essentially made myself deal with everything myself. not literally obviously because i have been in environments with psych professionals, but at this point i am over it. i am just sick of it. i am absolutely sick especially of the people who are so fucking dependent on people and wi will do shit like get in a relationship to be happy and then when they break up, fall into some dumbass episode and go through the same cycle over and over. people who are dependent in general annoy me so much. people who nonchalantly bring up their issues too annoy me unless its in a closed environment with a close friend or something. yeah i slip up because i like making jokes but when i make a joke about neglect or something i regret it i ammediately and am like this is the exact thing you hate, i amprove for next ti ame. i just do not enjoy that type of attention seeking and when i do it i ampulsively i correct it for as long as i can. i have a feeling this is because of my lack of a crutch as a kid or something. i mean i totally understand needing to open up but i think there is a ti ame and place, not in front of random people from school. idk man. this is getting too long. shit on me if you want. that wi will be fun for me. or do not be mean and be nice also fun	not depression
never had a girlfriend at i have dated here and there but never been on more than or so dates with a single girl. never had sex either. i am unsure at this point how much this is actually damaging my psyche. i have wanted it so bad for so long, but i am starting to wonder if i should just give up on it. the number of hoops you need to jump through just to have a ghost of a chance is ridiculous. i suppose i have been a bit picky in that i only consider girls i am actually attracted to, but honestly that just seems fair to both parties. has anyone in a si amilar situation significan notly i amproved their mood by getting a first girlfriend? or is it just grass is greener on the other side and it would not actually i amprove much? on the other hand has anyone who has never had even one girlfriend managed to up their self esteem significan notly while sti will remaining single?	not depression
i am no longer depressed not sure if this is the right place to put this, but i wanted to share. i talked to a hotline and accidentally told them i had a plan to commit suicide. police showed up, sent to the er, which sucked ass, then the psych ward, which was not bad at all although it was the adolescent unit which is probably way better than adult . got put in therapy, and finally escaped my emotionally abusive bpd mom. i was so convinced there was no point to life, and that it was not just mom, but it seems like getting rid of the root cause makes all the other shit go away. i do not know, i am not a doctor. i am just so happy i can continue my life.	not depression

vent tw i had a pretty intense conversation with one of my teachers on friday and it changed my pov on certain things. i dont see that teacher the same way that i used to. it made me very emotional and i can not stop thinking about it so i figured maybe talking about it here could maybe help. ive been struggling a lot with my depression these past months. my self harm got pretty bad and i am having trouble staying clean. my eating is very thisordered rn. i am losing weight. my dad is never home. i am the one who has to take care of my brother most of ti ame. i have a huge lack of motivation and school is a bummer for me rn. teachers have been noticing how ive changed since the beginning of the year and some of them have asked what is happening. there is this one teacher though,, my history teacher,, that has been very concerned and worried for me. he told me multiple ti ames that if i needed anything i could reach out to hi am but i tend to feel very bad in these situations. i feel like my problems might not be i amportant enough or i am being annoying. last thursday,, i was in class earlier and he told me he was extremely worried and that he really wanted to talk to me. i didnt really have a choice. when friday came,, we had a minutes long conversation on my mental health and i genuinely felt like someone cared about me for once. we spoke about my past with my mom long story short she emotionally abused me and the relationship i have with my dad. he also spoke about his past and i felt like i could relate to what he went through. i felt less alone. i felt understood. he gave me some tips and showed me videos that could help with my anxiety. everything went alright, until we spoke about depression and suicide. my dad found out about my self harm last summer. not a lot of people know that i struggle with that. i regret self harming just because of that one particular moment. anyways,, he asked if i ever felt suicidal and if i ever self harmed. i do not know what went through me but i had the strength to say yes . then,, boom,, he told me he already attempted to commit suicide. my stomach dropped. this teacher who was always so cheerful and seemed so happy with his life once tried to end it all. i can not stop thinking about it. it made me so sad. i am having so much trouble processing it. i know this is a really long vent and tbh if you re sti will reading this, thank you. i really needed to get this off my shoulders and if any of you want to share si amilar stories i would be happy to read them.	not depression

does she hate me? does she not? am i overthinking things? i am sorry if this is not the right place to post this, i am just fucking depressed about this rn. i do not have any friends in real life, only online, and i have this one friend who i can not tell if she hates me or likes me or if i am just being anxious for no damn reason. she often says stuff like i have to go study when she wants to leave the conversation and then someti ames i wi will see her minutes later in another chat. this makes me think she is avoiding me. however we talk for quite a long ti ame someti ames and it is not only me initiating conversation. but someti ames it just seems like she does not want to talk to me and it becomes silent quickly. we voice chatted about a week or two ago for the very first ti ame and i thought it was fun, however it became awkward towards the end when i started becoming tired and losing energy. ever since then things have just felt different. i feel like she is changed ever so slightly and i can not tell if she hates me more than she did or if she likes me more now. i just can not fucking tell and it is bugging the shit out of me. at this point, my online friends are really the only things i am living for. i just do not know what i would do if i found out that they all think i am annoying and stupid and i should just leave them alone. i feel like i am overthinking but at the same ti ame my anxiety and depression is just telling me i am right about them not liking me because why the hell would anyone like me in the first place? i am literally the most unfunny, unenthusiastic person on earth. i do not know what to do or to think or to say. i am just a mess rn	not depression

how i soothe my feelings at breaking point for me writing down reminders is someti ames able to offer me a little bit of peace. here are some. might be si willy but i read them often and it helps me. have faith in nature is course be confident in what you are worthy of, but not arrogant in what you have acknowledge your faults instead of fighting with yourself either open up or suck it up find passion in what you re good at and get good at what you re passionate in remind yourself of things you could miss out on worrying about the future changes nothing except the present. if the bad thing happens, wait to suffer until it does describe your feelings instead of condemning the thing that created them	not depression
i guess i am a lost cause its been months since i last post anything here. i have just been reading stuff in here. and from what i gathered, is that as long as you do not give up, you can make it at the end of the tunnel. but what if... what if i gave up? no longer i have the need to feel better. no longer i have the wi will to i amprove. i gave up my fight and let my thoughts consumed me. everyday i can feel my death clock ticking closer. as if i am just one thread away from falling into that decision to leave this world. i can no longer see the reason to stay here. the world may be beautiful for others but for me, it is something chaining me down. one day i wi will have that courage to free myself and end it.	not depression

not sure if it is depression or something else any insight would be helpful so my mom passed in , but a few years before that, i remember waking up one day like a switch went off inside of me. and i have never been the same since. sti will to this day, i struggle with it. it is not a sinking feeling. it is more or less a i could be in a room full of strangers, and watch them all thisappear and not feel a thing type feeling. just numb and devoid of any care for anyone or anything. i remember when my mom passed away a few years after this, i was by her side. everyone in the room was crying, even the nurses and doctors. here i am holding the hand of my best friend in the whole world, after she took her last breath, and i felt nothing. did not shed a tear until days later. it comes and goes. like some days i am normal, other days i just can not bring myself to give a shit about anything or anyone. it is not that i do not care or love anyone. i just feel numb from them. what is wrong with me?	not depression
lost at work i do not want to make a novel out of this so i am going to try and keep it short. i am a married late is man with two children who are in their teens. i have run a small business with my wife for several years. while business has been good, i feel like i am not doing enough. i might look as if i am happy or content with life, but i can not help feeling a resentment for others who are more successful and feeling as if i should be doing better financially in my life. do not get me wrong, i love my wife and children more than anything, it is my work life that has been dragging me down. i had the world by the nuts when i was in my twenties and now i feel like i can not catch a break. i feel as if ti ame is running out and i can not gain any traction to anything i do. it makes me want to give up on all my ideas of what i want from a business or career. i have been through some serious stressful shit when i was running a large family business years ago so i am not afraid of failure or risk. i am having trouble coping with the fact that i might not be able to build the business i want and achieve the goals i set out for. i am sorry if this is in the wrong sub but i do not know where else to post.	not depression

dating a guy who just started antidepressants ok, here is the rundown. i started seeing a guy approxi amately january th. we met through a mutual friend. we texted for about a week until we actually met up for our first date. which went really well! lots of chemistry and lots of fun. the next day monday he proposed another date at the end of the week and we planned it for friday. he took me to my favorite vegan restaurant and then we went back to his place and cuddled on the couch, watching thisney until like am. the next day we were both separately out with friends drinking. he had been texting me consistently all day but around pm he expressed that he wished i would have stayed the night the day before so he could sleep next to me . but then he also said he was afraid that i was not into hi am and that he had a hard ti ame telling if i was into hi am because it did not seem like i liked it when he kissed me. he said he was very into me. i just told hi am that i have always had a hard ti ame opening up and he understood completely. i ended up going to his place and staying the night. we had both been drinking though do not worry, i ubered and neither of us really had the expectation of sex. we just cuddled and talked. nothing weird yet. a week goes by, we were sti will going strong. texting all day, every day. we have a hard ti ame meeting up during the week because we are both teachers and then he had a friend in town over the weekend. he also tells me that he had been medicated for ocd, depression, and anxiety since he was . but i guess he had been off of his meds because he said he had an incident at the beginning of the year that made hi am have a total mental health breakdown days and that made hi am get back on them. he said i have bee off of medication and on it and i am currently in a weird place with it. i am adjusting to new dosages and dealing with trying to find the right amount. i understand mental health and tell hi am i totally get where he is coming from and to let me know if there is anything i can do much longer convo but that is the gist of it . we also had the conversation of how, even though we had not been inti amate yet, that i did not want to be just his booty call and he said that was not what he wanted either. so then the next week comes and kinda the same thing. we finally make plans for another date on saturday, two weeks after the last ti ame i had seen hi am. but, on the thursday night before we get out of school on friday for snow and i ended up going to see hi am at his weekly pinball tournament and meeting a ton of his friends. it went so well and we got along great he commented on how much they liked me . we had our date on saturday. we had dinner and went back to watch movies. it was, once again, great. we made plans for a little road trip the next weekend for his bday, he was supposed to help me move in two weeks. we cuddled in bed and talked a ton, joked. when we watched movies he forehead kissed me and scratched my back. literally such an ideal date for us. i leave the next morning thinking things are great. i do not really hear much from hi am that day which is fine. we both had a lot to get done. i text hi am late that night saying i had fun and could not wait to see hi am again and he responds the next morning with yea it was a good ti ame for sure and the emoji with the glasses. over the next few days it takes hi am forever to respond to things but is sti will randomly snapchatting me. after about days valentine is day i go out with friends and get drunk. i end up texting hi am that i wanted to know where his head was but he did not respond but he sti will snaps me the next day. i end up asking if we can get a drink that night but he does not respond. so i call and he does not answer the call but responds right away with a text saying he was celebrating his bday with his friends and was in a bar and could not hear. i say it is cool, hope you re having fun. i wake up with snaps from hi am but do not snap hi am again until monday his birthday. i say hbd, he responds, and i try to make conversation but i do not hear back. i text hi am one more ti ame on wednesday, essentially saying i like getting to know hi am, would have appreciated some communication, and it was not like me to open up the way i have with hi am. no response. my question i know i have been ghosted and it fucking sucks. but part of me worries about hi am as far as mental health goes. could this play any part in his actions or am i just reaching? i have done some extensive research on how antidepressants can affect personalities if it is not the right dosage and he did say how he was having a weird ti ame trying to figure it all out. we talked about some personal shit and talked about the future of our relationship and then poof. idk this is not like his at all. i need advice.	not depression
dealing with the loss of a loved one i thought i would leave this here. i have comfort and support, but if anyone else is going through the same thing, feel free to reach out. my mom passed away last sunday. we had the funeral on monday february . i broke down when i saw the casket. it was a moving funeral, but i do not wish anyone to go through this. my mom was . she had stage four metastatic breast cancer that moved from the breast to the cervix. from there, it gradually spread to the liver and bones, and finally to the fluid around the brain and the spinal fluid. my mom was a bright, wonderful person. she was full of strength and was always positive, even though she was going through so much. i sti will can not believe she is no longer here with me and my family. everyone loves her and her free spirit. she is no longer suffering and is finally at peace, which i am thankful for. it just ki wills me inside that i wi will never see her smile again. i love you and miss you mom. we all do. thank you for reading this.	not depression

always life was really turning around for me. i had tons more energy, was going out more and more. until last night when i got a dui. they took my dabcart and xans charged me with them both. for awhile now i have been living my life just getting high and taking . every hours. i have a tolerance to both so the purpose of these drugs were to just makes me feel happy not sober. and i was content with the way i was. now i am back at the bottom, i feel as if i am always the biggest loser. i feel as if i have nothing. i am always losing even if i am winning. can not afford drugs to get me to sleep. license is suspended now can not even go anywhere for days. no real friends either. i am so so tired of this world. it absolutely blows my mind how people can be or act normal. normality seems like a blessing more than ordinary. why am i the one with these constant and deep thisturbing feelings.	not depression

i have gotten nowhere i do not feel like ending it but i just want to go on a journey. have an rv for myself where i do not have to worry about money, i can go to a quiet spot where i can watch the stars with no light pollution blocking anything. i want to do something other than have my eyes always be tortured. i can not cry when i try too. i just lost all major feelings. i do not like to think about family. i am not near successful in life and i am always lectured. obviously if i do not want to be i just do my job, go to school, do homework, study, and finish. i think school has always been a problem to me. i think of what i regretted doing and get really sad like now. i have missing assignments at the moment and almost f s. i know i am getting held back and people in my life wi will hate me for it. i do not want to be a drop out because that is just bad. i am scared people would not hire me for a job seeing me as a lazy piece of shit. i know i am. i have always wanted to lay back and relax. when i try i could have probably skipped a grade or some dumb shit. only ti ame i have really tried is a question test in biology. i have always hated any type of science since middle school, and i know i have always hated math since i can remember. i did myself a favor and studied for days. aced the test and raised my grade. and then it happened again. i was lectured even when i did good. my teacher and parents said if i do what i did for my test, just focus, i can make it through. that give me motivation but every ti ame i think of school i am drained.	not depression
today was decent so today was probably the best day i had in a long ti ame. i did not have an anger attack yet, or a panic attack. i sti will cried but that is about it. today i had a concert because i am in stuff for singing cause it makes me feel better and i just enjoy it. i was really nervous at first cause i thought no one would like it and stuff but everyone was being so supportive and singing along with me it just felt so good. me and my ex talked without fighting or being upset. it was sti will kinda sad because when she says my name i sti will get that butterfly feeling and she kept saying it because i was teasing her with embarrassing stories. and i was very hyper today. could not stop laughing earlier. idk today just feels fake. feels like the days where i was not constantly sad nonstop. ofc i sti will was but idk today just had a lot of highlights and i also got a lot of compli aments today which helped. i was told my voice is deep which makes me feel good cause i think i am insecure about it, i did good at singing, and i got taller cause i hate my height and i was always really short. ik this group is kinda just for being depressed but i am just proud of myself. i hope whoever is reading this feels this ok soon. it feels amazing having a bit of weight off your shoulders for a minute. i just want to tell you you re going to be ok. you can sti will have good days and even if today was bad it can sti will get better. i promise you normally i just feel like shit nonstop. all i see is bad i just want to fuvking die and not be here. all i want to do is cut myself and watch the blood ooze out. but today i only hurt myself once which is an accomplishment. whatever you re going through it wi will get better. it wi will be ok. just keep your head up even when it feels i ampossible and you can not even get out of bed. just because you have a bad day do not mean the next wi will be bad. you ll get through this. just try your best to not self harm or beat yourself up. do not kys, do not get high, do not get drunk. because i promise you do not need that. you do not deserve to be hurt. you deserve to be cared about and you are cared about even tho more than most of the ti ame it feels like a person wouldn t even notice if you thisappeared one day. i promise you they would. if you ever need to talk just message me.	not depression

overwhelming sleepless night i need to write this somewhere because i am not getting any better. for some reason i just do not want to sleep, i am laying there and i can not turn my mind off. it is getting worse, and my body is tired, i am also mentally drained. i do not know if i am eating enough lately, my stomach feels empty and i feel tired. i feel so uncomfortable here, its overwhelmingly unbearable. i feel like i am in hell. i do not know if mental health is real or if it is something that is made up. i do not know if i am unwell or if i am just sad. but i do not know why i feel like this and i am scared of my own thoughts, especially when they are at their strongest and they make me feel so weak. and there is absolutely nothing in this world that i can do to change them, they begin to feel right. i am sat up now and i am not going to sleep again, because i just can not and i do not know why. it is been weeks and everything is falling apart because i can not escape this. i feel like my mind is lost on so many things i am fed up with aching, feeling i will and i am fed up with all of the anxiety and the ocds, misophonia and aspergers. i am tired of suffering and i am suffering from fatigue. life is so vicious and brutal and people are so nasty and unkind, and i feel so fragile and exhausted for carrying on. this feels completely pointless and pathetic and i am sorry.	not depression

i have to let go there is been a guy i have known for about years now. when i first met hi am we were dating after meeting on an app. we d been seeing each other for a few months before i decided to end it. to give you a bit of background this was the first period in my life that i was the happiest i would ever been. i would lost a tonne of weight and looked great. i loved my job and loved where i was in life. unfortunately that was my biggest downfall. i ended things because i thought i was not ready and thought that i was too good to be in a relationship. that to date is one of the biggest regrets in my life. he was the kindest, sweetest and most caring person i would ever met. he understood me in more ways than most people i knew then. but because of my own selfish needs i ended it. we saw each other a couple of ti ames each year over the next few years. as i had regrets and i think he felt obligated to see me. today however was the last ti ame i would ever see hi am. after getting drunk most nights and messaging hi am paragraphs explaining how i truly felt about hi am over the past year he finally decided to meet up with me to help give me some closure. i truly believe he was the one and i hate myself everyday because i was the reason this did not continue. i destroyed hi am and his trust in people because i was fucking selfish. it was great seeing hi am but i know that it was the last ti ame i would ever see hi am. i knew nothing would become from seeing hi am again today but i needed closure and i know he wanted to give me that. sti will an absolutely selfless and amazing person right to the end. i wi will never ever forgive myself for the decision i made at the ti ame all those years ago. i would do anything and everything to go back and change it but i can not. now i have to live with that. we could have been so good for each other and that is what hurts the most. knowing i could have been there for hi am during all the shit ti ames he is been through. but i know for his and my sake that i need to now let it go and move on. it fucking hurts and wi will continue to hurt as it always has but i have no other option. he deserves so much better than me but it does not make the pain any less severe. i know that people come and go but i have never been able to forget hi am or forgive myself. i wi will carry this cross for the rest of my life. maybe i deserve it for being such a piece of shit or maybe it was not meant to be. who the fuck knows. i wi will never stop hating myself for this.	not depression
finally got a big ol hug it is sad that i am almost and i find this post worthy but someti ames life gives you a little happiness. so today i went shopping to buy my sisters shoes for school. at some point the older one left with her aunt so it was just me and my youngest sister, going to stores and shopping. i brought her whatever she needed for school. then we went to burger king where she tried onion rings for the first ti ame. she liked them. and i showed her a little trick that went over really well. she is a very sweet kid at age before everything changes. afterward i drove her home after she got everything she needed for school and before i left her i motioned for a hug and she leapt from her chair and give me the tightest hug i felt in a while. it was amazingly satisfying, a real strong loving embrace that lasted longer than normal hugs. my bones did not feel so loved in a while. really it is the only thing i needed as a thank you. she is good and i hope we could spend some more ti ame together soon. something like this is so small but i have to thank god that i am even able to experience any kind of love. the world has beaten my kindness into the ground and it is relieving to feel like i am worth something to somebody.	not depression

my friend is severely depressed and i do not know how to help her. sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, if there is a better sub i wi will go there. for reference we are both . i am not sure i should be sharing all of this online but i do not know how to help her and i feel that sharing a few personal details is worth it if i can help. she is really depressed and has attempted suicide before, or at least come close drinking bleach, cutting . she has been having a really awful week and has been beating herself really hard, including cutting herself for the first ti ame in months at least that is what she told me . she is a really great person but if she ever makes a minor mistake or is even slightly rude to anyone she has a near emotional breakdown. she also has a severe anxiety thisorder. as far as i know, her parents are very loving but remain somewhat ignorant, not fully understanding that she can not just be happier . i do not know what to say to help her, or how to make her feel better. i want her to encourage her to have better habits not using self harm as a punishment but i do not know any tactics. i have thought about talking to the school counsellor about her but i am worried that if she found out she would feel betrayed or something like that. thanks	not depression
eh it feels nice to have teachers you can trust and understand your feelings. my history teacher one of the best ones i have ever had knew about my girlfriend her and i started dating and not a lot of people did, he told me he supported me. i have never had anyone be okay with my sexuality even my family put me down for it, but my history teacher? it is really nice hearing that someone supports you for the first ti ame, however.. she broke up with me on thursday night, he noticed i came into school on friday and that i was obviously upset so he asked me if i was comfortable talking about it and i just kinda shrugged because i was getting that feeling in the throat when you re about to cry. he just told me he was there if i needed anything and left it at that. i really appreciate hi am for that	not depression
venting ti ame i am sorry to my mom and dad for thisappointing you academically and with adult tasks when it is hard for me to even find a reason to get out of bed in the morning. all my siblings are well liked just like my parents and constantly sleep over at their friends house. i can not do that because i do not have friends and whenever i make an effort to invite people to places to do fun stuff nobody responds to my messages and even if some do nobody shows up . i have given up on trying to find someone to spend the rest of my life with because everyone is constantly reminding me that i am to short to love and on top of that they never let me be happy because when i am they just tell me how annoying i am and rub there bfs and gfs in my face. i have gotten people so much stuff and gifts for every holiday and field trip from school and all i want from them is some attention and acceptance but nope they just take my food and pure pressure me into letting them copy off my hw and tests. and my siblings ignore me and if i tell my mom how i feel, she goes and tells my dad who dose this thing where he plays the victi am and asks what he did to deserve this. oh well i can not cry anyway because it is gotten so bad that i just feel numb about it. i do not see a future full of light at the end of the tunnel. some people are just made to die. i know for a fact only people from my school would notice if i left and never came back. it is funny how i have made it this far by si amply living because i am alive.	not depression

i do not want to die alone, but i can not keep putting my heart on the line. so, i lost my best friend a little over a week ago. she is engaged, yet we developed feelings for each other and crossed some lines. she ended our friendship. and i get it. i let my loneliness affect things after we had been close for a long ti ame. but this is all in the aftermath of a relationship that ended a little less than a month ago. she was a frantic mess and struggling with sobriety but she was sti will way out of my league. and she just ended it. she was nice enough about it, but it gave me a taste that maybe i could have a sweet relationship, and be a good father, and have that life. before her, i was fine being a single recluse. but now she is all i think about, she haunts my nights, and she would not even return my texts. i am just so very alone. i can not seem to do anything but mope around when i am not working. but that is the thing. i do not want to die alone. i do want that life she gave me a taste of. but my heart truly can not take the amount of dating and pouring myself out and trusting and have people reject me and slip away necessary to find that girl. i wi will feel deeply for each of them, and i wi will inevitably lose my years of sobriety and lose everything i have built. i am not the kind of guy someone wi will choose over someone else. i feel i am a good man, but that is not enough. i just do not know how to breathe at at night anymore. every second feels like she just left me. and now i have no friends left. i messed up something good because i was lonely and saw my friend as a girl and not a friend. i have no friends with, at least not the kinds of friends you can trust at all. god help me. i just want a girl i can love deeply, and cuddle with, and raise babies with, and i can be thoughtful with, and she can be thoughtful with me. god help me.	not depression

oh, so now you get it? just kind of a morbidly funny story. got bullied a lot by this kid in high school who used to make fun of me for experiencing depression. fast forward to years post graduation, he added me on facebook. i figured, whatever, i am not one to hold a grudge. he just posted something to the effect of i am so glad i started getting help for my depression. i am happy that he is getting help, i think that is great, but it is like yo, where was that attitude ten years ago? 	not depression

i want to live so badly, but i just can not. i have not been waking up earlier than afternoon recently. as a result, the sun is rising and i am yet to sleep. the sight of it, mixing with one of my current favourite songs, reminds me how much i want to live. i seriously do. i want to live. i want to be, can not quite point out what, but i want to be. the sunrise is overwhelmingly beautiful, so is the smell of all seasons. i want to experience all four of them, but i am barely able to seperate summer from winter. before i can start living one it passes. i am getting older with no benefits. i can no longer reach my memories. they used to be so clear, i amagining was almost re living. now, they are just words and information of what happened, feeling as if there is a opac, dark coloured film over them. i waste almost half of my days, thanks to restrictions i apply to myself for purely personal reasons i would rather not to get into. i even thought about ki willing myself, not that i wi will do it, just because i do not want to bear with all those emotions any more. there are a few occasions i thought of what i would write to my suicide letter, of which all ended with me in tears. i do not even know if things wi will get better, they probably would not, but they have to also. i am so confused. even when i am happy, i am somewhat scared of what wi will be left when it fades away. i want this feeling to be depression. i want it to be just a state that can change anyti ame. i want my feelings to be validated. but, whenever i come here and see what people are going through, i feel so spoiled and undeserving. if anyone like that is reading this, i am so sorry. i am sorry for what you are going through, and am also sorry for complaining about small problems many would very much prefer over theirs. i am sorry for everything.. i do not even know what i am talking about, so i wi will stop. this adds just one more to my numerous rants. i am sorry if this post is bothering anyone, i just someti ames want to share my feelings.	not depression

i have been mirroring people is personalities for so long, separate groups have different perceptions of me i am in college and am really thisassociated and i suppose sort of depressed. one study group which, this semester, is made up of all toxic girls i play down masculinity and probably act more akin to a girl this group thinks i am gay. the group on my floor who are more bro like, frat guys think i am a fuckboi ladies man since i act like a bro around them. in terms of me, i do not really have any desire to pursue relationships, at all. midway through high school i had a huge crush, but the past couple years it is like i am aromantic. i feel like i am missing out on a key part of my teenage years which are now over . i have also sort of struggled with my sense of self as a result i am not anything either group thinks of me as, really feels like i am just a combination of my vices and anxieties. it has really been fucking with me, since i feel like i act like whomever is on my mind whether it be the people i am hanging out with or a fictional character i can not stop thinking of.	not depression
college was the best ti ame of my life and now that it is over, i feel lost. i have always had issues connecting with people and making friends. ton of social anxiety. during college, i finally found a community i could vibe with friends right down the hall, working together towards a common goal, etc . it is been years since i graduated. i have a boyfriend and i love hi am to death, but i miss the social aspect. i have not been able to find that at work. my neighbors all keep to themselves and there is no local music groups or anything like that to get into. i am so lonely and sad, all the ti ame. i feel like everything has went downhi will since i graduated. what is the point if life just gets worse?	not depression

to those who feel dejected or suicidal but have not told anyone i grew up with my emotions being centered around sadness. any joy, excitement, or thri will i experienced was always quickly reverted back to a state of melancholy and dejection. i was never clinically labeled as depressed, because i never told anyone how i felt i was never examined. one reason why despair was so prevalent within me was due to not having conversations about my feelings, which only amplified my negative thoughts. i sti will believe that i had good reasons to avoid talking about my thoughts with others during my upbringing. . my parents argued and were terrible and negotiating. . my parents hit me and scorned me which made me afraid of them. . my parents rarely asked me how i felt, which reveals further lack of consideration for my well being. . my sister and i mi amicked our parents we mostly argued. . some people at school were bullies. emotional expression was a target for them to attack i was not wi willing to take the risk. . my extended family was keen on threatening and hitting children, which made them untrustworthy from my perspective. my depression was initiated and perpetrated by the complete thisregard that other people had towards me. since i could not get angry without fear of attack, and i could not leave my situation i was sifted into a complacency role as a dependent and anxious child in a merciless and unsympathetic environment. if your experience is in any way si amilar to mine then i want to remind you of what you already know your suffering is not your fault. your suffering is mostly due to the environment and circumstances that you are subjected to by the design of your parents. someti ames we have to lie to others in order to protect ourselves from further damage that our peers and guardians wi will cause us. someti ames we have to lie to others, and that includes saying that we hate ourselves. i am here to argue, that you do not hate yourself. you hate everyone around you that allowed for and did not protect you from the predators that lurked within your tribe or community. for that, i am sorry.	not depression
i wrote this to another redditor. it just poured out so i figured maybe it might touch someone else. you are not alone. i fought with this condition. look, depression can make you feel like you should not be alive. it makes you feel like why keep going with this pain. the colors if life, are just dull. someti ames on a cloudy raining day, the blinds are all closed and either you are sleeping to avoid the pain or you sit there trying to watch tv in a neutral feelings state or listening to music. music is a life blood for someone that is depressed. someti ames it is the only outlet of all the sadness in our heart. you just want to be happy. so now that you know i can not only empathize, but i have been there. someti ames it comes back even with the medications i take. but it is no where near the darkest hours i have faced. it helps so much when you finally get the right meds.. when you do get there, and i wi will be honest it is not an over night thing, it takes years someti ames to fully benefit from it because there is no science to it like there is in other medical issues. so you have to try multiple, multiple, meds. but i kept going. i did not give up. just because you feel like your worthless is because you can not get past the depression yet. on the other side of that, is a different thing. you learn to have self worth. that takes ti ame. years someti ames. but when it happens, the blues get so blue. the green of grass are green can get. the magnetic field consists of positive and negative fields. without positive, there would not be any negative fields. there is no light without dark, no good with out bad. there is a quote that says the following they say there is no light without dark, no good without evil, no male without female, no right without wrong. that nothing can exist if it is direct opposite does not also exist. laurell k. hamilton if you think about it, it is exactly that. that is the law of the universe. there is nothing else. you, me, and everyone else has the opportunity to see that light. you, do mean something. your soul means something. your life means something. we affect everyone we come by. if you want to be happy and find purpose, you have to look for the light in the darkness. know, it wi will come. you have to do the leg wokk tho. go get help. forget money or insurance or even age. there is help. there wi will be light. remember it is the law of the universe. it wi will happen. do not give up for real tho. you are not alone. no. not at all. life for very dark for me. very. but damn i am glad i did not give up. let me give you a song that i played on repeat on my saddest days. idk if you are a guy or girl and that is irrelevant because it feels the same for all if us, but its jon bellion one way to san diego idk why he named it that though. it has nothing to do with san diego. but please, listen. at least once. so remember, it wi will get better. but you have to want to get to it. do what you need to get help to fight this. wish you the best, sorry for spelling errors, but my thumbs are now completely about to fall off lol. much love. if you need it. even to just talk. they are there 	not depression
i am afraid of what i might become if something goes wrong i am , living at home, jobless, no friends, no relationships, no hobbies, i just sit at home, browse reddit, watch youtube, give in to bad habits, and play video games. i have not eaten a proper meal in years, either eating too little, way too much, or nothing at all. my sleep is often from in the morning until late into the afternoon. i wake up at without failure, but fall asleep before i get out of bed. i forget what i was doing i ammediately after an interruption this is a constant problem and was even a problem in my childhood and often just lose my motivation. my father is family has a history of members losing their motivation or just not having it in the first place, alongside the hard working and enduring ones. my little brother and my older brother both work hard. my little bro is going through school to become a doctor, and my older bro is in the navy as a bosun, but i am just...not sure what i want to be. i am scared of becoming someone who never does anything with his life. i hate dragging people down, i hate being useless, and i hate being reliant on others. if all my hopes for becoming a better person fail, i am not dragging my family down with my failure. i am not dragging anyone down with my failure. if all i can do is fail, then i am not going to stick around for it.	not depression
i feel so uncomfortable after college i plan to work on a master s, but i can not do it right away because i have yet to fulfi will certain circumstances, so i am going to start in the spring rather than fall. i do not have a problem with this anymore, i can work to save up some money and it wi will be fine. the one thing that has made me feel uneasy is explaining it to my mom, she supports me in wanting to get another degree, but is constantly asking me about so many things. one of these things is me starting in the spring, i have vaguely told her about it, but she wants to know more about why. at one point i began to tell her, but stopped because i was reminded of a si amilar experience with her where i got so stressed out over something that i should not have. since this did happen about a month ago, she has stopped asking me about it, which has helped me not be so stressed about it. however, today she had a conversation with my grandmother about what i plan on doing after college and she of course told her about me starting a master is in the spring. my mom told me that my grandmother was not really into the idea of me not going directly into the program. this is the thing that made me extremely uncomfortable, because i am not close to my grandmother and she is not the type of person i would confide in about my personal matters. last year i visited her when i went on vacation by myself to her country, and there were ti ames where she would be harsh direct about things that would make me cry once i was alone. i am a very private person and i do not like sharing personal things about me, one of these being what are my plans after i graduate, so my grandmother is want to also know more about me made me not want to share with her. coming to terms that i am okay with starting my master is in spring has been something i had to slowly and calmly accept in order to not feel like i am thisappointed or a failure. but having people know about how i am going about it and hearing their opinions is something i do not want, because i want to hear the opinions of people i truly feel close to and who would not go mentioning my plans to other people.	not depression
my self hatred someti ames i just feel so sad, i think about my flaws and if anybody would stop me if i tried to take my life, but i think i am doing this for attention but at the same ti ame i do not, there are ti ames when i am really paranoid and sad and deep inside of me i want people to look my way but when i get the attention i wanted i instantly regret it and tell them i am just tired, i do not know if i am really depressed or just self aware that i am an attention wh re or in other words the scum of the world, and to those who are really going through a bad ti ame i am so sorry and i hope people can give you the help and love you deserve.	not depression
why do i feel sad after i share my sadness to someone? i have never shared my feelings with anyone. when i did it for the first ti ame, i started speaking about everything from the beginning. it was so difficult to do so and the words weren t coming out of my mouth but i tried my best. i thought it feels relieved when you share your pain with someone. but it actually made me even sadder. it was better keeping it all on the inside without sharing to anyone. it feels like a jar closed for so long is now opened and things are just leaking out of it and making me sad	not depression

i want to be happy first of all i would like to support people who have depression or going through difficult ti ame in their lives. i am a college student who is been depressed for many years. it started when my family fell apart, i lost all my friends and ended up home schooling and isolating myself for over a year. i had no friends, no social life, no goals or motivation to get up in the morning. i could cry myself to sleep. i ended up having paranoia and obsessive compulsive thisorder. it was hard. i could not leave my house without checking if my door was closed ti ames or falling asleep not making sure no one was watching me through the window. but i moved on, finished high school, went to college and changed my life. it took me quite a bit to get rid from all the mental problems i had. but unfortunately, i am sti will depressed. i work, take classes, smile and make others think i am happy and careless, but when i am alone with my thoughts i struggle from my own self. i can not stop thinking about how awful i am or that i am a loser. even if i have friends it seems someti ames i am not a priority to anyone. like i am a back up. if they are bored and have no one to hang with they call me. luckily i found my soulmate. and he is my boyfriend now, i am so grateful for hi am! i decided not to spend ti ame with people who do not care about me. do sports, study and i amprove my life. but when i am alone i am sad and needy. i am always looking for new friends and i am pretty sure i look petty. since the beginning of the month i have been writing down every happy moment that happened to me that day. even if i got a tasty coffee, i would mention it because little things make our life better. i just want to say that people around you do not know you are depressed. even if it seems that life is worthless find something that brings you happiness. give it a try. do not give up. the things i write down in my journal make me smile when i read them. during a depression phase or anxiety attack when i feel the whole world is against me i think about little things. a delicious meal i made, a funny episode of my favorite tv show, a hot shower after work, a beautiful sunset! i understand how difficult it is, but i also know if you put an effort in making your life better you wi will eventually enjoy it more.	not depression

memories, both good and bad certain sti amuli hearing songs or smelling scents from the past can bring back emotions from past memories associated with them. i just heard a song that reminded me of a ti ame that was good, but then it made me even more upset because those feelings of happiness were so short lived and never really amounted to anything. it sucks to be stuck in the past so much, whenever i get slightly better, i instantly start to beat myself up over how easy it could have been to i amprove my mood in the past, and then i am stuck feeling like shit again.	not depression

my online friend needs help first of all this is my first ti ame posting and i dont know if this is the right place but i need some help for my friend. here is some background i m have a friend f who i video games all the ti ame with and text and call for about a year. i dont know the specifics but from what she told me over the year is she is bi poler and depressed. she says she has been sad depressed? for plus years. she listens to really emo music from what i see is suicidal music. because i only talk to her online, i am not able t support her in real life the way she needs it. she is always talking and joking about ki willing herself a lot ever since i met her and it scares me. she has attempted suicide a few ti ame in the past and most recently she said something that hurt my feelings and after i told her how i felt, she cut herself something she has done many ti ames in the past . a few months ago she took a lot of pi wills but after realizing she did not want to die she went to the hospital and got help. every ti ame she drinks alcohol she starts talking bad about how useless she is and how pathetic and meaningless her life is. she sends every day sleeping, playing video games and getting mad at it or watching twitch. she used to take medicine for her mental health issues but stopped for reasons i dont know. from our conversations, she knows she has a problem but wi will not do anything to change it. i really want to help her but i honestly dont know how. she doesnt have many friends and as far as i know, none in real life that she can truly call a friend and talk to. i have tried the best i can to help her but she keeps pushing me away. she refuses to let me help her. not even a little. she says stop trying to be the bob the builder of my life. to be honest i am exhausted. i dont know if i should believe her words or keep pushing her to be better or just leave her as she is. its kinda driving me crazy always thinking if i made her mood worse, if i am being too much, if i should let her be alone. i dont want to leave her as a friend but at this rate i dont know if i can keep doing this and if i do thistance myself she might really hurt herself. i am writing this now because she just hung up on me and said leave me alone. has anyone been on either side of this kind o f situation? i dont know how i should handle this situation because she is very sensitive. any advice? thanks. update kept calling her until she answered and i talked to her and she is in a better mood now. she is actually laughing at me xd.	not depression

i either do absolutely nothing with myself or do something beyond absurd with myself. no in between. most days of my life i wake up and go to work at pm until am, and get home at am. then i do not sleep until am and wake up at am just to lay in bed on my phone or doing absolutely nothing until pm when i have to start getting ready for work and end up being almost late everyday. i have zero energy ever to do anything with myself and i always get too nervous about going to my only friend is house or even to my parents house. but recently i packed up a bunch of my shit and then drove to florida and see a friend i had not seen in years. i did not tell work or anyone i know. mind you i live in nh and it was a hour trip with one stop to sleep for hours and get a single meal. stayed there for a week and came back only to go to work minutes after i got home. then i lost the job. i do not know why i did this but i did not think of the repercussions and every once in awhile i wi will do something like that but i can not control the urge. i get so down and hate myself so much that i explode and wi will just leave because i know no one actually cares that much about what i do. and i end up spiraling into another level of depression and do something wild all over again. if you took the ti ame to read this, thank you and sorry for the rant	not depression
is it just the depression or.... every ti ame people come near me they talk about someone going to get shot... never actually saying a name. as well as people that i see on a daily basis are becoming thistant as to not even say the casual hi when they see you. did i do something? i do not ever intentionally harm folks. if they get mean with me, i do tend to show it back. but not in an overly aggressive manner. i try to be as respectful as you should be to others, over all. but i can not help but notice the unusual vibe i have been getting... the getting shot comments are really bothersome...i do not want that to happen. i just do not know why i have started hearing those comments. if i ask, the response is usually something along the lines of what?! that is not what was said... but sti will do not get clarification... this has happened multiple ti ames. not just a one or two ti ame thing...	not depression

can people please stop making mental i willness seem desirable there is nothing desirable about mental i willness. it is not desirable to feel completely destroyed and hollow inside. it is not aesthetic or cute to self harm, nor is suicide. my attempts have left me hospitalised for days, on drips and heart monitors, having my face turn purple and almost having liver failure. depression is fucking destructive for the sufferer and everyone around them too, it just feels like so many people my age make it seem so desirable and romanticised. it hurts to see all of my pain and agony made into something beautiful. it is anything but beautiful. i am stuck in a psych ward yes i am allowed my phone and stuck on meds which are only making me worse. it is not fun to have to wash bits of your own blood and skin off the wall from banging your head so much and it is not beautiful to have alarms blaring and having ligatures cut. it is fucking awful and i wish people would stop making it look idealistic.	not depression

how can you make someone with severe mdd understand he needs a hardcore treatment, more than just ssris, when he refuses it? hello r depression! i am desperate for help for my severely depressed bestfriend of years, i do not know how to help hi am anymore. he is years old, awfully stubborn, and do not, or can not, see how he is in the deepest ends of that black hole. he could not hold a job for more than months in the last years, he is been isolating and hermiting hi amself for years, medicating with huge amounts of alcohol and someti ames weed when he has money for it. he can not even see that he has an alcohol problem, its like he is in severe denial. his family is from the soviet ti ames, so they see it as laziness and not an i willness. only his grandma helps hi am someti ames, others from his family father, stepmom, grandpa gave up. all of our mutual friends cut the cord with hi am a few years back, they got exhausted from his behavior and how he would not do anything to help hi amself. i was the one all of those years that set up job interviews for hi am, since he could not do that hi amself. he has severe anxiety from talking to authorities, to the point he would not even call up his old job from years ago to tell them that he did not receive his last paycheck. his now ex girlfriend, whom he dated for the last years, broke up with hi am this last summer thinking that if he wi will lose her, lose his comfort zone and the person he leant on, he wi will get his wake up call and wi will finally start doing things to i amprove hi amself, his well being and life. that did not happen. he got to the point his bank account got seizure since he did not notify about his unemployment, got a debt since he did not pay taxes. no money, and sti will would not get a job. he sits in the dark all day, drinks, smokes, and plays videogames. i convinced hi am to see a psych and now he is on cipralex mg day for the last months. no change. he just sits and waits to die since he is too afraid to commit suicide his words . i try to convince hi am to get hospitalized, at least as outpatient, he would not listen to me or anyone about it. me and my other bestfriend his ex bff and his ex girlfriend had a long chat yesterday about his condition. he has been living with me and my husband for the last month, until yesterday when my husband mentally broke down and told hi am he needs to move back to his old place a unit on his fathers land which he took up as rejection and it went very badly to the point i was afraid for my best friends life. both of them said that until he wi will lose everything and everyone who supports hi am, his comfort place and maybe even a place where he can live, he would not take charge of his life. and even then, if he would not get treatment or do anything to help hi amself, it is his own fault and his own responsibility to take care of hi amself. i do not want hi am to get to that point, but even now he would not listen or understand how deep he is in it. is there anything, someway, i can make hi am see it? 	not depression

my best friend feels so thistant now my best friend, who helped me a lot with my depression when it was really bad recently, and who i have talked to nearly every day for the past months, recently said they wanted some space. i said i was ok with it, but it is ki willing me inside. in the past weeks we have rarely hung out outside of group settings, its mostly the only place i am able to talk to them. i feel like they treat me differently when we re in a group, than if it was just the of us. i am more often the butt if the jokes when they are around, and i do not feel like i can complain about it. i often see them prioritizing messaging in the group before responding to me, which did not use to be the case. i know it is probably irrational and clingy to feel sad about that but i can not really help it. we have got big plans together far in the future which is honestly one of the only things i am looking forward to in my life right now. sorry this post has no point, honestly i am just ranting because i feel better writing it all down.	not depression
i think i am getting better, but i fear for the hope of life. it might be weird, but to some extent, i do not want to be fully recovered. i used to suffer from severe depression. at that ti ame, my mind was stacked with suicidal thoughts, and i could not do anything except cutting myself and trying to ki will myself. with some medical help, i managed to press my passive thoughts down and give up the suicide plan. now my emotions are much more steady. i sti will do not think i deserve to live, yet i have no interests in ending my life for now. then i find that i actually fear of being cured, if that means to have a hope of life and lose the courage to commit suicide when the hope is shattered by reality. i do not dare to have any hope. i feel so anxious about the future. i can not bear if the hope is broken. i wish i could keep my existing attitude to my death i am not afraid of it and i wi will ki will myself if necessary. i know i am a coward. when barriers occur, all i am planning is to die so that i can escape from it rather than find the solution to the problem. death is like a perfect and permanent plan b for me. i do not want to lose that feeling.	not depression

why i have not given up last night i was feeling suicidal and i realized that i sti will have so many reasons to live. i had seroquels left in the bottom of my container and i do not know if that is enough, but i have been struggling with relentless anxiety and panic attacks since i have returned to school after some brutal set backs. i were to end my life, i would never get to eat chocolate again, have an orgasm, hear my favorite songs, never get to see another summer night, etc. those things may seem cheesy, but i often think things like what about my family and friends?? last night i did not think about how others would feel if i were to give in. truth is, most people in my life do not understand what i am going through and all they see is the goofy smile and they laugh when i tell jokes. when i let my guard down, people always respond with toxic positivity and platitudes. i hear a lot of people telling me not to be depressed or get back on the horse. depression does not work like that. if all i had to do was snap my fingers, i would have tried that already. today i got some help and spoke with a counselor at my university and on my way home tonight i am going to pick up a strawberry milkshake. depression has kicked my ass this winter and i have lost nearly pounds. i know this low wi will pass and there wi will be more hurdles to come, but i am fighting with everything i got. if you read this far, you re awesome!! putting my words out into the universe helps with the burden and i do not feel so trapped behind my mask. please do not give up.	severe
do not know how to get better when i can not talk to anyone about my thoughts it is too hard to talk to people. even professionals. i do not have any faith that anyone can actually help me and the process of going through all my emotions again with some one who can not even help me anyways is too much. someti ames, i am even physically unable to talk. i tried so hard today to speak up in a mental health group i attend daily but i just physically could not. which just made me feel even worse. every single day i have been crying because how of pointless and hopeless everything is. my entire life has been racked by depression and i am so fucking sick of half living but nothing helps. i am tired of going through medicines and therapists and all this stupid shit when it does not do anything. i have been starting to feel suicidal again lately. i used to go to an emergency mental health center when i was feeling suicidal, but the last ti ame i went there i had a bad experience and so all my trust is gone. i can not go there again and i do not want to go to the emergency room because they are just going to have me wait around anyways too. it is too humiliating to cry around people. i do not want to be around people when i cry. i do not want to go to an emergency room full of people when i am at my worst just to feel like fuckin boo boo the fool as i cry waiting around for hours for some one to be available. i also do not want to be committed to the hospital, either. i would just be going through unnecessary suffering being committed because they can not help my depression anyways. it is too hard to talk to anyone. i do not trust anyone enough to actually open up to them. i barely see my therapist these days and even the medication i take is getting harder as i have no income and they are getting too expensive with the small copay. getting refi wills is about to be ti ames harder because my therapist office is refusing to accept refi will requests via email anymore. i tried ttelling them hey i physically can not speak due to anxiety when i use the phone and they are like well you know you just have to call and you can talk to me or to your therapist and i am liek bitch did you fucking hear me? i physically. can not. speak. it does not matter if it is you or fuckin former preside obama i am talkin to i literally can not. it is pretty damn clear i am not being listened to or taken seriously. so, my only option for refi will requests is to now hope that on the very few days where i am actuall there each month, i have got enough energy left over after a therapy session to talk to some one else to request a med refi will. i guess again it does not amtter anyways since i can afford the medicine and i can not ask my dad for more money,. i have no income because i can no longer work due to how bad my mental i willness has gotten. thisability is i ampossible to get so i do not even bother applying for that. i have been denied twice already. and the forms are too fucking difficult to fi will out, it is so much, and because i can not open up to anyone or trust anyone, it is too difficult to try and get any kind of help from anyone to fi will them out. i am just so fucking angry and frustrated. this is all too hard. seeking help is too fucking hard, it is too hard and painful to try and open up to some one when they can not do anything for you anyways and you just do not trust them because you know they just do not care at the level you need them to. i can not talk to my dad about anything because it is too hard worrying hi am or explaining anything to hi am. i do not want to be around people or make friends or anything, it is all just too difficult. i really do not know what to do. i really really do not want to live like this anymore, but i am not strong enough to do what it takes to get better because i can not trust any of the people that are supposed to be there to help me. i go to a daily mental health group program everday and no one ever obthers coming to check up on me. i was told that i would get a weekly check in with my case coordinator but it does not end up happening. today, one of the coordinators there took my easide to check in she said, and i am like okay cool, finally maybe some one is showing some caring about me! and it turns out no she didnt want to check in she just wanted to scold me for something idid in a group last week and hten send me on my way without asking me how i been doing. its too hard to approach anyone myself, and its hard enough to speak up when people do come in and ask hme how i am doing. i literally have no way of communicating to some one i am doing bad if they do not even bother to check on me, though. it is just all so fucked. i do not know why i am going there every day when i do not feel like it is doing anything for me. it has not opened up any new avenues. it is just taking up ti ame in my life and making me exhausted because i have to be around people for like hours each day. it is so hard finding places there to be alone so that i can at least cry my feelings out a bit. they do not want you to isolate yourself so there are very few corners or places to hide, but i mean they also do not care about you soooooo???? i mean i get that yeah, they would care if they could it is just each coordinator has a lot of othher cases so they can not be paying special attention to any of them and if i do not go to them for help or lie when some one asks are you okay? , they can not know there is something wrong but it sti will boils down to they do not care and i do not trust them enough to talk to them because of the fact they do not care and feel lied to. what is the point of being htere? at least when i am at home i can sleep in bed all day and i can cry in my room by myself without being humi williated by people around me wathcing, and i can snuggle my cat, who does care about me. i am angry because i went to a partial hospital program in january after being suicidal for a while and i am so dumb because i actually came out feeling hopeful that things could be better and i feel like i was lied to. i am sick of people only caring about that i am alive physically. i do not feel alive mentally. i have people that love me and care about me but at the same ti ame,since they do love and care about me, they wouldn t want me to suffer anymore right? so even if i ki will myself and they are said for a while, they should understand that it is ulti amately okay because at least i am not suffering anymore. the weather is getting warmer which is really going to end up affecting my suicide plans because one of them is entirely dependent on the weather being freezing temperature and the other relies on people not being out and about too. i am just so angry and frustrated and depressed about how shitty everything is. i do not want o do this anymore. i think about having to live another years like this and it drives me up a fucking wall to think about. even thinking about having to live another years like this is maddening, i just can not do it.	severe
i want to give up two medications in and sti will on a waiting list for therapy. there is no recovery, no other side. my left thigh is cut up pretty bad after my downward spiral in the last few weeks. i know how i wi will go and i am fairly confident it wi will work. i am worried for the people i love, i swore i would stay for them but it is becoming i ampossible. i just sleep now, that is all i seem to do. even in good moments the darkness lingers. slowly everyone i love is being poisoned against me by my own mind. i am convinced everyone hates me and wishes i was not around even though i know this is not true of them all. there is a friend who has been with me through the worst, it breaks my heart that i wi will be hurting hi am but i am broken. i have reached the end of my rope, uni has gone to shit and i am too tired to go on. this would not be the last post i make, i have a few more weeks to tie up some loose ends. but i wi will be going soon	severe
pristiq and wellbutrin hello! i am curious has anyone taken pristiq and wellbutrin together? or any two antidepressants at the same ti ame? i am currently taking mg pristiq and mg wellbutrin for about weeks. my doctor calls it a combination therapy. any feedback is appreciated.	severe
other people can not solve your problems! i recently got a girlfriend but i only get to see her once a week and i think that is part of the problem, i just feel so lonely and empty all the ti ame i am not with her. the past years i have been depressed the main feelings being paranoia and anxiety like right now i am even thinking what if she does not even really like me despite saying yes and it drives me insane. i wi will never tell her this because i do not want her to feel any kind of responsibility or pressure from my depression this is my own battle and i do not want to involve anybody else in it. the hardest bit is i convinced myself i would feel better if i actually had somebody since i have been single for like years but it hurts like hell now because i do not feel any different at all. i guess i just made this post to say other people can not fix your problems.	severe
i wish i was not born i am a stupid, worthless piece of shit. i keep doing the same stupid mistakes. i can not take this anymore. my adhd just makes it worse. i can not do anything properly. i am stupid. i wish i could go back in ti ame and, prevent my mother from marrying my dad. someti ames i regret every single breath i take. i want to take my antisepressives all at once just to overdose and die.	severe
i am getting low again i have been in and out of the hospital since i was i in highschool. the longest i have been in was an entire year. the last ti ame was when the th of july weekend and my new years resolution has been to not go to the hospital. i do not feel like it is particularly helpful and there are always way more critical mentally unaware people i get mixed in with. i am sti will very young and i have my whole life ahead of me as people always like to remind me. i am frustrated at my inability to cope with life and i am afraid to go outside. i already feel so dead inside. i want to be strong and do not want to go to the hospital again tldr depression dragged me back down i feel dead inside, do not want to go to the hospital again because new years resolution was to stay out. the longest i have stayed inpatient was a year and it was traumatising. i want to be able to not need the hospital as i feel they do not particularly help and there wi will always be someone sicker than me	severe
i am scared to get help ive been extremely suicidal for the past years and have been cutting myself and i know if i dont get help i wi will not make another year. but i am too scared, i am scared family wi will judge me, i am scared doctors etc wi will judge me, i want to ki will myself every single minute of the day but i am too scared because i think people wi will judge me after but also i think if id do it how many others could i save by taking my own life. people could wake up and realise something isnt right and we need to actually do something but for me it would be too late, i dont really know how id do it but id love to get drunk or something and just swallow a bunch of pi wills.	severe

is there really any hope for me if the only thing keeping me from kicking my depression is my own lack of wi willpower? i got diagnosed with depression after a suicide attempt a few years back, and i have made shockingly little progress since then. thing is, i am objectively well off. i have two understanding parents who very much want to see me get better, health insurance that let us me get affordable meds and regular therapy sessions if i so desire them, an okay track for the future it is not great or anything, but i doubt i wi will ever end up homeless or something like that , and so much more. i have got more things going for me than not, and yet i sti will make little to no i amprovement si amply because i do not have the thiscipline necessary to make significan not progress. i am thoroughly aware of how much work it takes to get past depression, but knowing that just thiscourages me. i can not even apply myself enough to clean up my own fucking apartment regularly, and that is just the third step in the nigh li amitless list of things i wi will have to do to truly get better. my entire life is an monotonous story of dashed expectations, abandoned projects, and missed opportunities all completely owing to my own lack of conviction. i am being totally honest when i say that i have never once accomplished anything of note through raw determination. everything of value that i have ever done has been the result of external forces coming together such that i never had a choice but to see the task to completion. that is never going to happen with fighting depression though, and i know that. i am the deciding factor in whether my life gets better or not, but i am also a lazy failure with no real achievements. whenever i am in a mood and see myself in the mirror i can not help but think this is the guy who is supposed to reverse this whole trainwreck? really? if i can not find the motivation to get better, why am i sti will wasting ti ame and taking up resources while i pretend to try? seems like dying would spare me both the trouble, and the grief that would invariably accompany my eventual failure.	severe

someti ames i feel like i am faking it i have been suffering with depression for as long as i can remember. i remember being and sobbing because i was so excited that i got to die some day. in my day to day life i am known for how opti amistic i generally am. i am always laughing and making jokes, and it is all genuine. that is why i feel like such a faker. i have been crying so much the last couple weeks. i just took a shower and it was so hard to get myself to even get myself to grab the soap. i just feel lazy. there are so many more people that are struggling way worse than i am. i am socially fine , but i have so much late work at school. i am so stressed about it. but because i seem so okay, i feel stupid even talking about. i am going back on anti depressants tomorrow morning cause i feel so useless lately. that also makes me feel so dramatic. i think that is just years of being taught that emotions are weak and lazy by my family. projecting! my favorite.	severe
i started antidepressants today! removed 	severe
i feel it creeping back up. i was on meds for about a year and a half, and tapered off in december due to my dr is recommendation. i thought i was doing okay, but this semester has been so rough and i can feel it coming back... but i do not want to deal with constant doctor appointments again. i know i should go back, and i know i need to go to therapy but since my last therapist left my school i have been scared to go back and redo everything i would gone over with her. not that it matters, since i am moving at the end of the semester so i would have to start over another ti ame after that. i am so tired. i just want to be normal.	severe
i need to vent... i have suffered from depression since i was . frankly, i am surprised it was not sooner. or maybe i just did not know what it was back then. i have attempted suicide ti ames, but never had the guts to go through with it. evenv	severe
did something really hard ... been struggling mentally for a really long ti ame. i wrote my suicide note and was about to do it before being stopped by my boyfriend and family. a lot of it was linked to being in a super hard professional program and being essentially bullied by adults my peers in my program . i live about hours from home and ended up going back home for weeks in order to get help. i am going to a therapist twice a week now to manage my ptsd and i had to come back for one day in order to do a presentation and go back. it is been really hard being in my apartment where i had a severe bug infestation for almost a year. i am feeling really nervous but, i am here. i think it means something that i came here despite how i was feeling. i think it is a step in the right direction.	severe
i am not joking when i say i am ready to die. i feel that nothing matters anymore. my family does not treat me with any understanding whatsoever when i am in a slump, and i am seriously okay with the idea of dying. just as some background to help... i am and i have been diagnosed with depression for years. yes, as stupid and odd as that sounds, i have been diagnosed since i was and feeling this way even longer. i have been to four doctors in that ti ame and none of them wanted to help me. the one i am on now, number four, legiti amately would not even try. i have done everything but jump on her desk and scream that i am suicidal and wi willing to die or ready to start self medicating. i have been on every single medication there is, but she would not adjust the dosage of the medications that do need adjustment. yes, my depression is treatment resistant, but that does not mean i should be kept on the same dose of xanax i was on when i was i rarely used it until recently, it is not given me relief for years and i would only taken it like twice a year until a few months ago . she would not listen when i said, before i was even using it regularly, that i get no help from it when i am panicking. my panic is constant, even though on the outside i do not show anything anymore in terms of my everlasting terror. doctor number four keeps trying to push tms on me, but i do not trust it and i do not want to pay dollars in copays for something that makes me uncomfortable. she is legiti amately trying to force me, and if i had any kind of confidence i might try raising some flags to the main person at the practice because she is not giving me any other options and she would not listen when i tell her that i wi will truly never ever want to try that or pay for it let alone commit the ti ame to that. anyway, nothing helps me. i am always ready to break down and my sister constantly berates me. she is younger than i am, but she has more opportunities than i ever had... yet she makes fun of me because i have not gone to college when she knows full well that i can not afford it and with my luck i wi will never have any scholarship opportunites because there is always someone better than me. my father makes fun of me with her over everything, and my mom gets sick of me fast. the only thing that makes me feel any better is temporary and ends fast but it is long drives to nowhere with mcr blasting in the car with the volume up almost all the way. as soon as i get home from escaping i sit and want to die again. like i am wi willing myself to just thisappear. there is nowhere that i am safe and nobody i can talk to. it is been about six years since i last physically sliced into myself, and i feel worse than i did then. i feel numb in every sense of the word. when i am not numb i am on the verge of a break down. i do not sleep, i do not really eat, and i can not do anything worth my ti ame. i do not have a job, i had to quit my most recent one thanks to a coworker repeatedly calling me retarded after me explicitly stating that i have asperger is and she always blamed me for her mistakes which does not turn out well when you re both pharmacy technicians and when she is the one that loses the fresh bottle of oxy and i got blamed, but she did get in trouble for that one and not me , when i mentioned it to hr i was told to suck it up and get over it. the other staff members did the same things to me when i only ever kept my head down and did my work, i only ever complained about the schedule because it was i ampeding my ability to go to the f ing doctor. i was hired part ti ame and scheduled six days a week, they tried to call me in on my one day off, and i was not allowed to be unavailable on days when i would had something planned for over a year or had an appointment at a doctor is office. i can not get hired anywhere else because i live in the middle of nowhere and there are not enough jobs so i do not get any calls for interviews. i see the same job i have applied for posted multiple ti ames, even after i have applied for the position about ti ames and never even get an email telling me they are not interested. the job before that had already started breaking me, but that one completely shattered the small amount of mental health i had left. i do not even dare ask doctor number four about thisability because she does not even listen to a word i say. my point is that i literally want to ki will myself and get it over with. i have never been on a single date, i have no friends, and the only living being that actually cares about me is my dog and even then she is more than happy to spend ti ame with the other members of my family . i have no hope of ever finding someone to keep me in line or stop me from sinking further and further in to my terribly self destructive habits and i have nothing to bide my ti ame with. if there is a reason why i should not just dig razor into myself somewhere i would not be found so i can die in peace i would love to know.	severe
i think i had a depression caused stroke. i always read about depression affecting your health negatively, but last week i had an episode in which i felt faint, face went numb, etc. i have a ongoing concussion so i thought something was happening along those lines. nope. my wife took me to the er and they concluded that i had a tia, or a mini stroke. they ran every kind of test on me and could not find a blood clot, so they assumed it thissolved on its own. i went to my regular physician for a follow up. he thought it was odd that i had a stroke. i am not exactly old or a smoker or extremely overweight or any other of the other risk factors. then he kind of said something in passing about how stress and depression can also cause these kind of events. i was shocked, but when he said it i knew that is what happened. i have been so super down for the past half year or so due to not working, money issues, kid issues, etc. and no one is really listening to me at how bad off i am. so i just wanted to get that out there. i thought it was kind of interesting. my wife and family tend to play down my depression, so they do not agree with me shocker! so i guess i wanted to share with those that might understand.	severe
i am so thiscouraged context i am and in th grade, therapist suspects i have been dealing with depression since yo. i was only formally diagnosed last year, but everyone who knew me could tell i was depressed. also diagnosed with ptsd i have a hard ti ame sleeping and getting up in the mornings. this was really bad in th th grade, i was late to school almost every single day someti ames to multiple periods. i would miss classes because i was crying in the bathroom or just felt so dead i could not bear to go. recently i have i amproved a lot, which i was proud of. i am late at most ti ames a week and only to one class a day. i was really happy i have been able to make that progress, even though i know it is not ideal. this year my dad has started punishing me more for being late, in the past he would just yell at me but that was it. i was not allowed to take my driver is test because i was late twice that week, i am missing plans with friends, and they do not really want me leaving the house. i understand that they are frustrated but it makes me feel so terrible that i have worked so hard and now that i am doing better i am being punished. it is making me not care about school anymore and i do not want to bother because i know that if i am late any plans i have are fucked. it keeps me trapped in the house and makes me even worse. i am so close to just giving up on graduating, i do not think i even care anymore.	severe

i never allowed myself to realize how bad my depression was until my doctor diagnosed me when i only came in for ad hd testing... i thought it would be good. but i have never felt so at risk. i have never felt so alone... i can not remember a ti ame when i was ever truly a happy person. the ti ames that i i amagine i was were the ti ames in early childhood that i can not remember. maybe i was not, but i would like to i amagine that i was because that makes me feel as though my dream of overcoming this lifelong nightmare may come to an end. i am the eldest in my mexican family and right from the start, i was forced to take responsibility for all my brothers and cousins. in a family that size as you can probably i amagine through often true mexican stereotypes i was stressed from that young age. in the machismo of my family i was not allowed to ever truly spi will my depressive thoughts because they were taken as insults to my family. and i was shamed for even having thought these. this gradually got worse for years and ignoring these thoughts, having known the terribles effects they have wreaked one my psyche and life, i listened to my family and i amagined i was crazy... i am years old and went to get myself tested for ad hd, as that has caused me horrible issues all my life as well and i would like to succeed in college. but i got my diagnostic testing to see more diagnoses other than ad hd, including major types of depressions and anxieties. i could not help but almost cry, because for once i did not feel crazy and thought my family would actually try to understand and care for my feelings... ... they did not... and the hope has drastically begun to die within me. i do not believe i have ever felt more alone... ... i feel as though my friends who see me are slowly watching me ti will my inevitable end, soon...	severe

how do you react to the encouragement on the internet? i hardly ever write, but i often lurk in such subs. i do not have depression as a diagnosis, but i have a diagnosed ocd and another thisorder, the psychiatrist said it was close to depression and she was considering writing this diagnosis as well. anyway. when you read these things depressive episodes, etc., on the internet boards, there is always someone who writes things like you are strong or there are people who love you or it is going to get better or some other cheerful nonsense and good vibes only as if i control the fucking vibes and they do not come on their own and try to lead me to the nearest bridge . previously, it could drive me mad, nowadays not so much, but sti will yes, yes, it is someone is wrong on the internet . what is that supposed to mean? we are anons on the internet. you do not know whether that guy is strong or not. you do not know whether he has people who love and support hi am. is it because of the thiscrepancy between someone is dire situation and the support that comes in the form of the most blatant, canned cliche? i am not a native english speaker and not from an anglo culture, maybe that is why i miss something about it?	severe
increasing my dose of antidepressants does not help. i was diagnosed with depression from years ago and ever since i have been put on meds per the instructions from my shrink. at the beginning i was only taking one pi will of zoloft a day, but after a few months i did not feel any i amprovements and was sti will as suicidal as i used to be. i thought the meds did not work so i stopped using them for a while. then things started going into a downward spiral from there. i stopped seeing shrinks and refused to meet any therapist because deep down inside of me i have always had this sense of thistrust towards anyone beyond my closest circle. i have grown tired of telling them my stories over and over again. two years from when i gave up on my meds my parents forced me to see another psychiatrist, and this ti ame she si amply suggested doubling my usage of zoloft and i should see i amprovement in a few months ti ame. i felt a little better during my first couple of weeks on added dosage, but after that i guess my brain has grown used to this extra input of sertraline so i gradually went back to my older pessi amistic, suicidal self. i have had a couple of unsuccessful attempts at overdosing throughout the years, and now i am prescribed to a laundry list of meds for depression, anxiety and sleeping problems. sadly, after taking this cocktail of meds for months even the smallest trace of i amprovement is nowhere to be seen. maybe this is how it is meant to be. i am now halfway through my grad school program and i am aware that i am just too exhausted to carry on. being surrounded by all these motivated, normal people makes me loathe myself even more. now that i know medications are not going to solve my problem and committing suicide would really traumatize my loved ones i feel extremely apologetic to my parents because they have been super supportive along the way , i really do not know what to do now. but at least there is reddit, and i can safely pour out what is on my mind without being recognized by anyone so people around me in my real life would not see me as a fucking freak or weirdo.	severe
my partner of . years is probably leaving me because i have been depressed for the past months. i had the first good day in months today. i cleaned house, went shopping, cooked dinner, applied for jobs and then the whole day went to shit. he told me he could not take it anymore and that he is angry and resentful and not sure he would be able to get past it. i am drowning and completely heartbroken. my dr has recently changed my medication. i have been talking to someone, when i can. it has not helped yet but i am trying and doing my best. i wish i could fix myself. i do not want to lose my step kids and my daughter wi will be heartbroken. my stupid brain has been telling me i am a burden to my family and this reinforces it.	severe
i do not know how to go back to school hi so i do not really know how to start this, guess i wi will introduce myself first? so yeah i am around years old, studying in college and i have had depression since i was about i think? that is when i vaguely remember trying to ki will myself for the first ti ame well not exactly but i do remember trying to choke myself, whether it be trying to actually die or not . anyway, so since then i tried a few more ti ames, only one of them being actually close naive me thought i would die by gulping down a few pi wills heh. but that is not what this all is really about. so as i said earlier, i am at college, and in a kinda particular situation. i did my first semester almost fully last year, but dropped out of my second, which means that this year i only started at the second semester. last year when i dropped out i pretty much explicitely told my parents i needed help long story short sent a message saying hi, i can not do school anymore, need to go home or i am going to hang myself . but what happened is that i just stayed home for almost a full year, barely getting any psychiatric help, although i knew i needed it. after that year i went back to school kind of by default. and i do want to continue though, because i do not feel like i would be worth anything without a degree, and it is something i am genuinely intrested in, so i want to do it. thing is, since i only started second semester i do not know anyone, like, at all. the only person i would have known is someone living in my dorm, but he dropped out. that combined to my solid social anxiety, i know i was going to have a hard ti ame at getting to know anyone this semester. so anyway, semester started, went to my first lesson, my second, my third, and that is where it got oopsie. had a bad day, did not go to my third, or my fourth, and that is how the thing snowballed. although i kept following my courses at home, doing my homework, stuff like that. but know i do not know how to go back to school. i feel like if i am just going to barge in some class i have never been to, after it is been going on for weeks, i am just going to get judged or something or at least feel out of place. sidenote there is an ani ame outbreak company where the mc talks about why people are hikikomori is basically reclusives and that is exactly how i feel rn . so yeah, i do not know how to go back to school. thanks for reading 	severe
i do not think i am clinically depressed anymore but i have been suicidal recently hi, i guess i am just here to vent. sorry the sentences are blunt. i am very, very tired. had severe depression for a few years. dropped out of highschool and had to delay my entire life because of it. got better and came off my meds june of more like forced off my meds long story then gradually got better because the side effects were ki willing me . spent a few months dealing with withdrawal then felt better than ever. have not self harmed in a year. started enjoying and appreciating life again. kinda got my life back and i am hoping to get into uni soon. recently i have been feeling very hopeless though. i notice that whenever i do feel this way for a while, my mind wi will just turn to thinking about ki willing myself. my uni exam is in two weeks and i just can not bear the thought of failing. it is been too much, too many years of failure after failure. i have been extremely exhausted. the pollution here is horrendous. i have to travel hours to my tutoring school and hours back, usually late at night. it is only a couple of days a week since july last year but lately i feel like i am barely able to keep myself standing up properly. from today, however, for the next two weeks, i am going to have to come here everyday. i know it sounds like i am whining and i am sorry but i this is how i have been feeling. i feel like i have brain fog most of the ti ame, which worries me so, so much. i have been super anxious lately. even when i just stay home i sti will feel incredibly tired. i have not been enjoying eating anymore, i feel like it is a chore and incredibly annoying maybe that is why i have been tired. my period is late and i have been losing hair again. i know i am probably just stressed and not thinking properly and there are solutions to every problem but.. for some reason it just makes sense to just skip to the end already. if we re bound to die anyway, and we re not going to remember any of this, none of it is going to matter when we re gone, why bother? why struggle so much when all that we have worked for is going to be gone in an instant? we re going to lose everything in the end. we re not going to even have the consciousness to feel sad about losing it. the only thing that is keeping me here is being afraid of hurting the people i love. i can not let them feel the pain of losing someone. i attempted suicide once, and the guilt and seeing my family crying from that ti ame has been part of the thing keeping me from seriously doing it again. but dammit someti ames i wish i could. i feel like my sentences are not making sense anymore. please try not to make mean comments, i am a bit fragile right now. god i sound like a pussy. thanks for letting me have the space to vent.	severe
i am getting bad again rant so trigger warning on a lot of this i guess. i am getting really bad again with my depression and eating thisorder, i am restricting and binging and purging loads. tive also been having self harm fantasies, i am years free from cutting, bur i scratch to the point i bleed someti ames. i am on antidepressants but in being kind of reckless with them, they made me feel numb and then i was numb to taking them, now i am doing a lot of drugs and wanting to drink a lot, i know i am relying on them just to feel something. i am getting a cat today so i am hoping that wi will help with loneliness when i am on my own. i have had depression for going on years now, and i dont think i wi will ever properly be happy ever again, i didnt recognise it as depression until years ago, and i wasnt diagnosed until years ago, and even then nothing happened until i took control of it a year ago. i realised that if i had normal parents i wouldve been sectioned like years ago, i told them i was suicidal and self harmed, i told them i wanted to run away and thisappear. they only cared about how they looked to other people and would have been too embarrassed putting me in a hospital. i am getting bad again, and i am scared of hurting my fiance if i do go down that path. i can not stop it. i am scared of myself. everything is falling apart and falling behind in uni and i am slacking in work.	severe
for the first ti ame i was desired by someone, but i was thrown away long story short, i am an emotionally sensitive dude with ptsd and extreme insecurities. i am a virgin and i am . my social ski wills suck and i do not look approachable at all. some girl actually appeoached me at work though awhile back and i think it is only because she had problems herself and related to me on that level. she played me for months and only used me for attention until she found another guy who interested her more and she dropped me. i feel lonelier and uglier than ever now.	severe

first ti ame i completely open up about my depression. any advice or si amilar experiences are appreciated. i remember being depressed for the longest ti ame but i would always been able to pull myself out of it and i never lasted long in that state but around a year ago i plunged into a depressive episode and i have not been able to get out of it. i noticed that these short depressive phases i used to have were developing into something more when i completely lost all ability to feel any kind of emotion except anger and sadness. i became completely numb to everything and i could not feel anything for anyone in my life. i hate to say it but even my mother who means everything to me i stopped feeling love for. i started to drink a lot and i wouldnt be able to focus for more than minutes at a ti ame on something. i spent of my ti ame in class either asleep or watching shows. i could not study my grades were dropping and frankly i did not care and i seriously considered dropping out of university. i can not even begin to explain to you how irritable i got i would get angry and annoyed at the smallest inconvenience in my life and everything would piss me off. one of my friends got in a really bad car crash and was paralyzed and the only thing i felt was annoyed because i had to take ti ame out of my day to visit hi am in the hospital and the whole ti ame in was there i was thinking about how much longer i had to pretend before i could leave. i was continuously pretending to feel happy joy excitement empathy at all ti ames of the ti ame because i knew those were the correct feelings i should have but i just didnt feel anything. back in september i went to see a psychologist and she officially diagnosed me with depression but i only went to see her twice before i decided to stop going. i never tried to hurt myself but i would wake up every morning and wish i had not woken up. there was just one instance in january where i was driving on the highway at night i closed my eyes and let go of the steering wheel but only for a moment before i grabbed it again. i think that was when i knew i reached my lowest point. january i saw a psychiatrist and i started on brintellix but i had to stop it weeks later because i got really sick and i never went back to my psychiatrist so i could start on it again. when i was on it i dont know how it was possible but the second day after i started taking it i felt like myself again my body was literally tingling i felt surges of electricity and so much love for everyone and i was genuinely happy. after stopping it i can say i am not as bad as i was before but i am not good either. i sti will feel all those things but i am more able to study now and focus in classes. yesterday i found out that my grandmother who i love so much most likely has cancer and has a surgery tomorrow and she might not make it. i feel terrible about saying this but when i heard the news i didnt feel upset i mainly felt annoyed that if something happens to her i am going to have to miss out on a lot of classes so i can support my mom. i dont want to feel this way anymore i feel like a monster and i dont know how to get out of it. i feel like the longer this lasts the deeper i get into the hole and the less likely i am to get out if it. or if i do get out of it it wi will be more likely that i wi will get back into it at the smallest inconvenience. am i ever going to feel like myself again? i just want to live a normal life without feeling like i am one bad moment away from drowning	severe

dealing with intrusive thoughts i have great days most days lately but my thoughts are just so strong it is really suffocating when i am alone. i have been so inconsistent with my medicine as well so it is hard for these thoughts to be numbed out. the spare medicine i have because i do not take them does not help because i just think about taking them all and hospitalising myself.	severe

i can not keep going on like this its been one year since my last suicide attempted and got admitted to hospital. i thought if i work like hell and just focus on work i might be able to push it deep and ignore it, turn out i was wrong. i get more stress and constantly get anxious all the ti ame not to mention, sure going workaholic might help ease up that feeling bit but right after office hours or on weekend i feel empty sort like lonely. they say go out with friends and but what if you do not have one? what i am supposed to do then? pray to god? hobby? i lost interest in all of it. i tired of going to a hospital talk to a different therapist all over again and take meds. what is the point if i sti will feel like this. years tons of doctor and therapist and hospitals. i try to plan something for the future like planing for a trip and getting new transport in hoping that i would not think about suicide since i got something planned and commitment but it is sti will the same. i can not go on with feelings like this, it hurt and feels empty. i tell myself i can not let myself feel like this anymore, it got stop. one way or another. i do not know what to do anymore, taking your own life its only logical answer here.	severe
your hand in mine.. honestly i did not think reddit was goin to help release some of these bottled up emotions. i am severly depressed. i am years of age. i dropped out of highschool. thisowned by family for having different views on life. a lot of emotional things happened in my life lately, and it brought back depression from when i actually tried to take my own life. ive been learning to cope and get better. its awful, but to just stop thinking about everything in my life i would go get high.. yesterday i did alot of stuff i dont know what i am trying to say, but it makes me so sad that there so much sad people on here.. i just want to say.. it does get better..only if you want it to get better! if you want to stay depressed and suicidal, then sadly you ll always be like that. i have let anxiety and depression control my life since . i am so tired of being this zombie. i honestly ohh just went on a rant so sorry, but if anyone needs someone i will be that someone because i know how it feels to be alone, feel useless, unwanted, a ghost. i have a hard ti ame crying when i need to.. i am emotionally damaged. but i want the best out of this life of mine and you deserve to smile everyday too! but anyways heres a song that i think anyone should listen to. its not sad, but you ll make what you want out of this piece. https youtu.be cdiy kijyhe sorry if i sounded cringe. its some real shit tho	severe

i hate depression i hate being in a bad bout and you know you re being stupidly sad for no reason, you know you re being too sensitive and taking things too personally, letting things bother you too much, but you can not stop because you re busted until further notice. i hate feeling sad and tired cranky and irritable and tired, so tired all the ti ame. i hate sleeping for hrs before work and feeling tired all shift. chugging coffee and popping caffeine tablets all night just to get some kind of energy. i hate actually being a neat freak in a messy house because i have motivation to do anything. i want to clean i literally want to and i just do not like wtf is wrong with me? i have no motivation to cook food so i just eat junk and gain weight. i feel really bad right now. i felt really bad all last night at work. i just wanted somewhere to vent. i am on cipralex which helped my generalized anxiety a tonne but did almost nothing for my depression. i am fucking sad as hell and i do not even want to be this is so stupid.	severe

my cowardice just makes me more depressed i fall into depressive episodes more like a bi polar way than a constant depression. i have this recurring thought when i am depressed. i want to self harm to feel better. i want to cut myself or make myself vomit or burn myself. but i am too much of a coward to go through with it ti ames. then i start thinking the same way about ki willing myself. like if you weren t such a chicken shit you would just ki will yourself and then you wouldn t have these problems or experience these feelings. i am wondering if anyone else feels the same way or has the same thoughts?	severe
i am not okay last year in late june i quit my first job out of college. i was there for less than a year since i graduated in may . before then i got an apartment in the city and i was excited to start my life. i worked as a paralegal because i was considering going to law school, then i saw firsthand how miserable the lives of attorneys are. i enjoyed the tasks but the work environment was so toxic. i grew more and more anxious and felt such a deep sadness that i did not even know what brought me joy anymore. i quit in june and then started working as a real estate agent as i thought about what i wanted to do next. i figured if things went well enough in real estate, i could make a career out of it. well, i live in a major city and competition is through the roof. no one in the office helps me or answers any of my questions. i have asked agents out for coffee to hear their advice on the business and literally everyone has said this is not a profession, it is all commission, it is too difficult, you re too young, etc etc. i look like a very calm, at peace individual, but inside i hold on to everything. i cry a lot at home. i force myself to sti will stay active, go out for social activities, and so forth, but nothing takes away this aching pain inside of me. i am years old and i feel so lost in life. i put a lot of blame on myself for majoring in journalism when i should have done something like engineering and actually get a livable and comfortable career out of it. ever since i quit my job i have been living off of my savings and doing so is incredibly stressful. i always thought i knew what i wanted to do in life. i had such big dreams of working as a journalist only to work in the business while i was in school and thiscover it is not what i wanted at all but it was already too late. i graduated at the top of my class in university and i can not help but look at where i am now. sti will relying on my mom to help me with rent even when i did have a job. she is in a great financial place to help me and encourages me consistently which i am grateful for, but i do not want to have to rely on her financial help because i am an adult and i should have this all figured out by now. i need to give an answer if i want to renew my apartment lease by april and i do not know what to do. if i do not have a job by then i would not be able to and wi will have to move out of the city back home, about hours away, where jobs are even scarcer to find. i met a developer, investor, and realtor who owns his own small business in the city near my apartment and he is been almost like a mentor to hi am. i saw hi am yesterday and explained my situation to hi am. he told me that if i wanted to i could leave the current real estate company i am at and go work for hi am and he would give me all of the rentals and sales his business has and walk me through the process. i told hi am i am hesitant people even make a living from this because right now i am at a luxury real estate company and clearly people are doing well yet they refuse to help. he said it is all about competition but at his business it is literally just hi am and one of his friends. he is already very established in life so he does not need the business, he just keeps this local real estate shop open to help out friends and family. i know he wi will help me, but i am worried about not having a stable fixed income or a secure job. i found an opening for another paralegal position and think i might apply. the pay is a lot better than what i earned in my first job, and because this mentor lives so close to me perhaps i could work with hi am part ti ame. he assured me i could make a full ti ame salary with hi am, but because i am so responsibility and security driven i worry about having a commission only income. even if i do work as a paralegal again it is a job that leads to nothing. there is no growth within any company, you re just stuck there. and i absolutely do not want to go to law school. so here i am with no clue what in the world to do. i am putting so much pressure on myself to have everything figured out. i have been stress eating a lot recently and that has not helped. i feel so down about myself and what my life has become. rents in my city are outrageously expensive and to find roommates is a complete nightmare. everything i love pays absolutely nothing. being an adult has taught me that people work themselves to death doing something they hate of the ti ame. i do not know how i can live like that. painting used to bring me so much joy and now i struggle with just being alive. i do not understand why people have children when life is this difficult. i feel so lost and i do not let myself just mourn this ti ame of uncertainty because i can not, i need to get out there and be an adult and pay my bi wills and move on because life does not stop for anyone. i feel this heaviness inside and i do not know what to do. i have contacted therapists and one took over two months to contact me, and the other one month, and the other i never heard back from. i hate the situation i am in and as a proactive person i want to have my life figured out and the fact that it is in shambles is ruining me. has anyone been in a si amilar situation? how did you get out of it?	severe
i can feel my happiness slipping away and i am desperately trying to hold onto it. maybe writing about it wi will make me feel better. it is been months since i have felt truly awful. things have been looking up, overall i got a raise at work, i am getting my debts kinda in control, i am sti will in a decent relationship. but i can feel it all fading. it is like waking up from a vivid dream, where you can watch things slip back into normalcy as you come to your senses. the fire is fading, and the world is getting colder each day. colors are losing their vibrance and i am hopeless to try and stop it. this i willness is a curse a monster that hides in the deepest recesses of my mind. some black, unknowable mass of bile and writhing, hateful tendrils. it sits there, waiting for the perfect opportunity to fuck everything up. i wish it were as easy as people think it is to rid myself of it. these social media positivity charlatans insist that happiness can be found in a walk through the woods, or in the gym, or in the arms of a lover but it is all horseshit. the thisingenuous, saccharine sweet wholesome bullshit is tiresome. i want to be happy, that is my end goal for life. not to become rich, or famous, or even successful. i just want to be happy. it is what my mother wanted for me before she passed, after all. whatever you do in life, trouble, just be happy. why can not i be what she wanted me to be? i try the meds, the counselling, all of it and all i feel is like i am screaming into a void that steals my voice before it gets the chance to escape me.	severe
my story with medical gatekeeping and why american healthcare is a sick fucking joke from the top , i have depression and ptsd. i have had the former all my life. i was diagnosed with the latter last year, but have probably had it for far longer. it only began to take over my life after i was raped in . i have had to be sent to a mental hospital for med adjustments and suicide prevention on multiple occasions over the last years. until about hours ago, i had been withdrawing from my antidepressants and hormone treatments. i had started withdrawing about days prior. i spent those days being shuffled around and gatekept by everyone with the authority to help me. meanwhile, withdrawals and brain zaps were fracturing my brain and causing me to howl like an ape over the phone to my own mother. i was denied a refi will of my antidepressants and hormone medication about a week and a half ago, around valentine is day. none of my medications realistically require regular checkups, but from what i understand this is legally required for all controlled substances, be they antidepressants or adderall. so i told the pharmacy ok, order a new script. they told me no, talk to my doctor, they probably want to check on me before giving me a refi will. despite everyone is insistence that this happens regularly, i have never needed a checkup for antidepressants. i have not been examined for hormone treatments since . they have just given me the fucking meds. in reality, unbeknownst to me, the practice the pharmacy was ordering these ghost meds from, which was the wrong practice and not my pri amary care, had silently closed their doors. no word of this at all to me. i was not informed of this until calling them today, over a week later. meanwhile, i attempted to call my pri amary care, the real people writing my real prescriptions. the separate, now closed practice wrote me a prescription once as a one off thing, and that is why they were in the pharmacy is records at all. the latter practice was what my pharmacy requested my new prescription from. however, my pri amary care is voice menu, separate from the other, closed practice, was broken and hung up the call before i could even speak to anybody. in effect, they were hanging up on me. so i went back to my pharmacy and got a day prescription to hold me over until i could get an appointment. the average psych schedules first ti ame appointments at least a week out, if you re lucky. i went through those meds in the blink of an eye. when i went back for another, i was informed that i could be given only one day prescription regardless of how long i waited. talk to your doctor. i told them i could not, because they were hanging up on me. there was no way they believed me. they just repeated themselves then sent me home without meds. this was around friday, the st of february. i spent from then until monday unable to contact anyone, and withdrawing from my meds. the pharmacy was just totally down to let me do that, i guess. meanwhile, the original request they had made to the closed practice was just floating in the ether, being faxed to no one. at this point, the denial was four fold my pri amary care was giving me the cold shoulder, the pharmacy was refusing my meds, the practice i called for backup just up and vanished, and my new insurance had not been updated in pharmacy records yet. no one was explaining to me why now, of all ti ames, my meds were being taken away. as an extra layer, my family had changed insurance in , so no prescriptions written could even be paid for until i eventually had that updated. none of this was communicated directly to me. i toughed it out and spent friday monday withdrawing from all of my meds, then went back to the pharmacy on monday to explain my situation. i was told again to talk to my doctor. i explained that i could not, because they were hanging up the phone on me. the pharmacy insisted they could not help me. i was not sure what else to do at this point, so i had my best friend take me to urgent care that night for emergency rx. withdrawals and brain zaps were making it hard to walk and talk, so my body was only letting me sleep from early morning to late afternoon, and urgent care was the only place that was open besides the literal hospital. despite this, urgent care insisted that they were unable to write prescriptions for antidepressants, and redirected me to the er. so my friend drove me to the er. while we were in line, we got a front row seat to about cops tackling and arresting a rowdy kid in a wheelchair. after about an hour in the lobby, i was called to the back. i was then made to wait in an er bed for about hours. i got a nap out of the whole thing, at least, as well as a request for days of meds from an rn. hell yeah! all i had to do was pee in a cup, because lord knows i coulda been doping on that desvenlafaxine! that was worth me giving them an unmarked, untraceable bottle of my pee that they now just kinda have my mother insisted to me, whilst i was losing my shit over the phone, that this was the fault of the opioid crisis, and not that of the moronic bureaucrats that created it. i love my mama, but she lives in this weird quantum state where she is si amultaneously saving my life and lecturing me about why all of my feelings are wrong. i dunno. mothers. so long story short, i got to go home from the er with an alleged prescription in my name for days of meds. great. i went the next day, tuesday, to my pharmacy to pick it up. i was told that the original request was sti will pending and to talk to my doctor. it was only then that i was informed that the lost request was going to the closed practice, and it was only then that i called the now closed practice as backup to thiscover that they were even closed at all. i went back to the er to see what the deal was and ask for a paper copy of my prescription, on authority from my mom, who is very experienced with bureaucracy. after another minutes in line, i got to ask for a paper copy. after another few minutes in the lobby, an rn pulled me aside and found the log of the prescription from sunday night. i was not permitted to leave with a paper request, so the guy called the pharmacy i had just left. the pharmacist there found a prescription under my current legal name and the meds were apparently waiting for me this whole ti ame. that was not what i was told! so i went back to the pharmacy one last ti ame, asking what the deal was. it was then that i had found out that the pharmacy had not yet updated my last name, because my old last name was not updated for whatever reason on my insurance card from . mind you, i had my new insurance card in my wallet with my current full name on it, and i did not know where or with whom to udpate this information, so requests were being made by like different people under different names for the same meds. none of these requests have gone through yet. this much was all figured out between myself, my mother, and pharmacy staff over about an hour long conversation. it was only then that i had my name and insurance properly updated for both the hospital and the pharmacy, and it was only then that insurance would pay for the prescription from the er, which they could now finally see. once that was all said and done, i sti will had to pay on my parents hsa card. i tore open the packaging in front of the lady as quickly as my shaky hands would allow and gobbled the pi wills down right there. and i ate ice cream cause i fucking earned it. i asked my mom why it took this much. she told me give it a few days to figure it out . i could tell she was trying to tell me, diplomatically, that i wi will realize in ti ame that this was my fault. this is what happens when i try to have a backbone about fucking anything. what was the point to going to all this therapy to i amprove my self esteem if it is so fucking scandalous to everyone around me the moment i do? why am i the asshole for wanting meds as soon as i need them? it is not personal, i just want my brain to fucking work. sure, hindsight is and if i could navigate bureaucracy flawlessly, then yeah, maybe i could have had meds before i ran out. but i did not because i am and no one taught me this shit. why is that my fault and why do i have to suffer for it? i am not even sad anymore i am just fucking furious that this is what i have to deal with. but apparently i was supposed to just take all that shit lying down and say thank you for dessert. why is everyone so dead set on shoving trans women into a grave, huh?	severe
so many people depressed someti ames i think to myself just how many people are depressed. i asked my classmates if they were depressed, almost all of them did not want to talk about it. i asked my neighbors kids if they were, i swear they were lying when they denied it. my brother just told my parents he is.everyone pretends to be happy, well i would not. i would not deal with it much longer. it is just so frustrating that so many people are depressed, but none of them understand me and what i am going through. i have had three eating thisorders in the past years, i almost ki willed myself ti ames in the past years and i lost my previous motivation to live. i am done.	severe
i am worried my doctor would not take me seriously i have been seeing a therapist recently to help with my stress and anxiety in school, work, and research. i recently came to the realization that i may be struggling with some symptoms of depression and brought it up at my last session. we went through all of the major symptoms together and he agreed that i was exhibiting diagnosable symptoms and recommended i meet with my doctor for an assessment. the thing that worries me is that that two symptoms i do not meet is suicidal thoughts and unexpected weight gain loss. and that because i do not want to ki will myself my doctor might not take me as seriously. i am relatively functioning most days, but the lack of motivation is so debilitating some days that it takes the entire day to get through one homework assignment or a tiny chunk of studying. i go through every day hating myself for not getting enough done and obsessing over every little failure. but i am able to force myself to complete tasks, i have goals for the future, and i do find joy in some things and i worry that because of that the rest wi will be brushed aside.	severe
i am out of place and do not belong and can not make it. been suffering from deep depression for a couple of years, before that it was manageable and did not consume everything. i just can not see when it wi will start getting better, i can not find the motivation and capacity to do normal people things. i can not make appointments, i can not go to the shop without severe anxiety, i can not write a cv or a cover letter to apply for jobs, i could not finish my degree that i spent years studying. i sti will feel like having my ex back would make me feel validated and loved, hoping it would kick start my life but i know now she would not ever come back because good things do not happen to me and even if they do i would ruin them. my mood swings are crazy, i am so irratable i hate it, i have random moments where i will sob for mins straight just because i miss her and just want the happiest moments of my life back, even though i ruined it for myself and i am just angry at eveeything. i live with regret everyday with a large side of guilt, i can not move on from her because i just do not feel worthy of anyone so i keep myself hidden away and avoid people in general. i am thisliking a whole gender because of a few girls who have broken me. something is seriously wrong with me besides depression, i do not feel in control, i do not have a grip on myself, i do not know if my emotions and feelings are true or if i can trust myself or not. my mind body and soul are not in sync. i feel any normal person would have got out of this and found a job atleast but i have not had a proper job since and i wi will be this year. my grandma is on he rlast legs and my dad can not go see her because we can not pay the mortgage for the ti ame hell be gone. if i was not this depressed and suicidal over my ex leaving me i would be able to help hi am out and go see my grandma. people keep saying i need to do things for myself but i can not, i hate myself now a lot, wto apojt where i have stopped caring about my appesrence or hygiene in general i have given up. i never thought my future would be this but then again i did not actually have a plan for the future so i guess i can not complain. all is my fault and if i want to get better i have to do it myself no one can live my life for me. after all the debate in my head i always come to the conclusion of death. it is so sad that life has become so unlikeable that death actually excites me. i wouldn t harm myself because i am a coward, but i would be happy to hear i have a li amited ti ame left here. i have played enough and maybe i have not tried as hard as everyone else but i see this as natural selection, i do not have it in me to fight, i do not want to pass on my weak genes. i envy those who have stable minds and can do things just because they have to. most likely i am just super lazy and stubborn but id rather die than to fight to live in a world where there is lots of people but not enough humans. the solution to my problem may seem very obvious to some of you and that is awesome but i have zero reason to live or lack of wi will to live. zero ambitions zero dreams. i just feel like if i could get my ex back then i would be happy again and i would feel good about myself. automatically your brain wi will say no that is toxic and not how it should be but how do i explain that its how i feel inside and can not budge from it and how low it makes me feel when i think of her. i haveost my identity and truly feel like i can not make it through life alone and without her. i smoke in the hopes of getting cancer and then i can finally be free from this suffering, wish me luck. thank you for reading.	severe

finally going to see my gp about depression amp anxiety. what should i expect? i have finally come to terms with the fact that i have no control over this and need a professional to help me. i have read books amp attempted cbt, done meditations, apps, journaling my thoughts emotions, changed my diet, exercised, delved into my hobbies, and more. each ti ame it thistracts me for a couple weeks, but nothing ever sticks. i have a loving family, solid friends, supporting fiance, a good job, a place to live, and sweet dog and cat. everything is right on paper, but i think something is just wrong with the chemistry in my brain. i booked an appointment this weekend and today is the day i see my gp. what should i be expecting? i am terrified that if this does not go well that my life is going to be like this forever...	severe

spitballing my problems for the first ti ame not sure what a good path forward for me looks like mostly first ti ame poster, and honestly, just thiscovered this subreddit even though i knew one must have existed out there . over the past month or so, i have come to terms that what i am experiencing is, at the very least, in part due to depression. i have yet to see a therapist and should begin shopping around, to be honest , and it was easy to put in the back of my mind when coupled with other medical problems i am trying to sort through incidentally, if anyone wants to take a stab at my recent post in r askdocs https www.reddit.com r askdocs , i certainly wouldn t mind... . what really prompted me to start talking about it was the physical manifestations from my depression. i cried for the first ti ame a week or so ago since , for pretty much no reason. i was sitting on my couch, knew i could not just be alone , and called up a friend, and just i ammediately tears started streaming down my face. we did not even talk about anything consequential, mostly tv and video games, but it was helpful and eye opening at the same ti ame. i dunno what more i should can type. i just kind of spitballed a bunch of my thoughts, and its made me feel a tiny bit better. i am open to advice and suggestions. this is new to me, in the terms of even acknowledging what i am feeling. thanks in advance, folks.	severe
 year depression i am and have been depressed for over years. i was extremely successful at one ti ame but have not been able to obtain that level since. i was laid off in from a great paying job that i loved never had another job since. i sti will had a good side business but that eventually went under in . after trying to find work without much success i lost all motivation and gave up. after my money ran out i have been surviving by the grace of family with some money coming in here and there from real estate. while i once had a beautiful house i lost i now live in my deceased grandmothers house in a lower income area, while i am thankful i have a roof over my head the run down neighborhood adds to my depression. i have had a wonderful relationship for years that ended months ago because of my depression. she was so supportive and tried so hard to get me motivated to get help but i always refused. she wanted to get married but i always had a dumb excuse why i could not. after years of trying to fix me and my unwi willingness to get married she said she needed to move on. i know if i showed any interest we would have stayed together but my twisted mind thought if i can not give her the happiness she wants let her go find it...and she did. i took her for granted and thought i could just continue without her but i was wrong. over the years i have alienated all my friends from not showing up or talking to them, damaged close family relationships because of my depression and not realizing it threw away the only good thing i had in my life. we truly loved each other but the depression became too much for me to over come. i would give anything to have her back as i now realize how i amportant she was to me and how much i truly loved her. she was the one thing that kept me going on even through the depression. now without her my life is empty, meaningless and has no worth. it feels like the final straw. as depressed as i have been i never had serious suicidal thoughts much until now. i no longer see a future or light at the end of the tunnel. at the chances of meeting someone again in my situation is next to i ampossible. i just feel so alone without her. she was everything to me and it hurts that much more that the only reason she is gone is because i could not find the strength to try. i am sti will trying to fight but hope is fading. all i see is a lonely miserable future from here on out and i can not go on with this pain anymore. the only thing stopping me is the devastation it wi will cause to my mother and daughter. i do not know where i am going with this other than i need to vent. i would never talk to somebody about the seriousness of my intention to ki will myself. it is just so hard to try and continue to live. i threw away the last good thing i had in my life.	severe
my life has been trashing me since about age i am now. i am extremely lonely, i struggle with unmedicated schizoaffective thisorder, ocd, panic thisorder, and several more completely unhelpful verbal designations. i am gay and incapable of finding a partner either physically or digitally but i want at least some connection very badly. i have gotten fired repeatedly because i am too weird for retail, but that is the only job that exists in the united states now that does not require either a full ti ame schedule or like college degrees and a multitude of ski wills i do not have. i am flunking out of classes because i am lonely and depressed as all hell. i have seen tens of therapists and can not be helped by a single one. it is a back and fourth with me and other people, where i am constantly told i need help. then, after all of this, i finally decide ok, i gave it my best and society life and the world are rejecting my existence, i should just leave this place i get put in a fucking hospital where someone throws up on me and i hear screaming sounds all night and i am not allowed to leave because i am so panicked that i do not fall asleep, but then they force some powerful drug up my ass and then i have to fight falling asleep because every ti ame i do i hallucinate shit and panic, then they give me medication after medication until i fucking collapse and i feel like shit for days. i wi will never tell anyone i need mental help again, because every ti ame i do i suffer for it. in my view, these are basic needs and easy to meet. i just want to love someone and have a house. that is all. i used to have dreams but i realized i am not allowed to have dreams. i want a job too, but i am too stupid to hold them. i am not a hard person. i am not evil. i do not know what i did to cause this. i do not know why it is so fucking hard to do stuff that everyone else just figures out. i can not find help, i can not find a relationship, i can not even fucking find a friend. i can not find anything. it is like you re trapped in a room and told to find the key but they forgot to put the fucking key in my room. i am full of hatred for everything because after a point you can no longer tell yourself it is my fault . because i feel like it is not my fault anymore. this is relentless. this is caused by someone something else, some other system in place. like i guess for so many people to be happy in the system one has to suffer and i just got unlucky and ended up at the bottom of this machine.	severe

my life is pointless this is going to sound very chilthish, sad and pathetic. but i am sick of living my life the way it is, but there is nothing that can be done about it. when i was born, my father died. he was around for years, until i came along. then when i was a child, all my friends deserted me, because they thought i was a loser. i had a traumatic childhood, due to my abusive and alcoholic stepfather. as a teenager, i was in a relationship, but it ended by the ti ame i was . that girl, wrecked me to the core. she completely destroyed me, and my self esteem. when another girl came along, i liked her and she liked me, but i could not do anything about it, because i felt she would only use me like my ex. i started to drink and perpetrate cri ames, getting arrested, then released without charge. i became arrogant, pig headed and mean. now, i am , and have no friends or relationships. i live with my mother and stepfather and sister. i am unemployed, but do get paid for stating home with my thisabled sister, while our parents are working and there is no one else to care for her. i often get drunk, more and more these days, and want to end my life. i have tried stabbing myself, but can never go through with it. i am the friend nobody likes and nobody wants to be with me. i get rejected for jobs a lot, i only apply on the off chance. the only thing i enjoy doing is writing. but i am not even very good at that. this is not a question, it is more of a rant. but thanks to those of you who answered.	severe

my suicide attempt haunts me after two years in therapy for my severe depression and anxiety i am finally well enough to continue my studies and i can even meet people again. but this clarity and progress birthed a whole new struggle... the memories that haunt me every single day. in i attempted to take my life. twice. luckily i survived both of them and came out physically unharmed but i think it has traumatized me really badly. i recently started getting these scary flashbacks and i often go into a thissociative state because of them. everything gets blurry and nothing exists then except me and the terrible i amages of me trying to make my suffering end. even the word suicide conjures in me the nauseatingly painful feeling i had during my attempts. it really interferes with the semi regular life i have carefully built up from the ground... do any of you have si amilar experiences to this? and if so, how do you cope with them? any advice is very much appreciated.	severe
i withdrew from college today i have always dealt with anxiety and depression, but it is steadily gotten worse. this semester, suicidal thoughts were more frequent and appealing. i finally told someone and they recommended that i take a break from school for intensive therapy. i feel like a failure, i am leaving behind years of education that could prove to be worthless. but i am also relieved because i do not want to die, i just did not have ways to cope effectively. i went and told all of my professors, and i may have cried a little, but it is bittersweet that i finally formed connections only to leave them. i can only hope that i can be better one day, and wake up without hating myself.	severe

talented with no motivation... i have dealt with depression for so long that i can not even tell if i am depressed or not because it is so normal to me. a few months ago the new therapist i was seeing at the ti ame wanted to talk about my severe depression to which i reacted i have severe depression? i guess i am just so used to feeling low that i thought i just adapted to it. one of the things that has bothered me most over the years is my complete loss of motivation and energy, especially regarding things i do particularly well. i used to draw a lot as a child and so many of my teachers and peers were sure i would be an amazing artist some day. i used to love creating portraits of my idols, dead or alive. i can not even bring myself to pick up a pencil nowadays, and it is been like this for years now. i walk by my art supplies collecting dust, and i see everyone is lovely art posted on the art subs i follow and it hurts because i feel like my potential has been stunted, halted, paused in a way. i also loved to sing and i would belt out my favorite songs, i even used to sing in public and my heart would soar with happiness whenever i got a standing ovation or felt proud of myself for reaching holding newer notes and getting better. now, i do not sing in public ever. i barely even sing when i am alone, the most i wi will do is hum, and that is on a good day. i am afraid if i sing now i wi will sound stupid or wonky or someone wi will come along who is better than me and more vibrant or hard working, someone with a go getter attitude that i can not envision in myself. i cry frequently nowadays. i feel shackled by the monotony of my pathetic life. pain seeps in and i feel myself wanting to desperately isolate myself and allow myself to wither away into oblivion despite knowing that i have people who love me and care about me. some days are okay, and i manage to laugh here and there, but the bad days feel never ending. i yearn to have that spark back in my life. i want to create things and be the person i am meant to be. i have had bad experiences with antidepressants in the past, as well as mood stabilizers. at the moment i can not afford therapy anymore so i am in a particularly fragile spot right now. just wanted to vent. thanks for reading if you did	severe
feeling so guilty. burns and taking lexapro for the first ti ame. let me break it down how my week went. i have been seeing a therapist for months weekly. i told her in my first session that i used to have depression. i am now. i have been seeing her mainly for other things that i needed help with i would tell her my feelings etc. i never thought i had depression any of those ti ames before. last monday i went to her and i told her how i feel like i have no personality and that i feel like a shell of a person. anyway, she told me right then and there that i had depression the whole ti ame. i was so shocked because i wake up and do everything day to day but upon looking, i guess i did have it. she recommended i go back to my psychiatrist and try antidepressants again. i used to take lexapro. anyway, i took mg last night and today morning around am i get super light headed and passed out. i later went to work at pm and i got lightheaded, and fainted on the water thispenser. after waking up i felt a burn. i burn a huge area around my butt and leg. a nd degree burn. i went to urgent care now i feel so guilty. i felt guilty when i told my parents on monday that i was diagnosed with depression. they did not understand and told me not to take medicine. they said it was all in my control. they blamed me for feeling bad because they give me anything i ever wanted. i feel so guilty now. before i passed out the first ti ame. i called my mom and told her i was not feeling well. when i woke up my mom said did you know what you told me over the phone? you said you were suicidal! i did not remember saying that. i feel so bad because i am getting both of them worried. i work with my parents fyi.	severe
the worst thing in depression is realizing you are depressed. and i realized it after taking the pi wills two weeks ago i was at an all ti ame low. my gf have been cheating on me for two months while i was working horrible jobs and taking care of our beautiful baby. when she finally told me she was in love with the other guy, i was already broken inside, so when she left me alone with our baby, depression kicked in for real and destroyed my rationality. i took many pi wills and i nearly died ti ames. i do not know why but i fought for life, even getting up by myself when the ambulance came worst physical pain ever . when i got out of the hospital, they told me i was fine, and i believed them. but now that i am alone and that i can not see my baby, i am realizing they were wrong. i can not sleep at night, the slightest inconvenience can ruin my day, and someti ames i regret that i fought against death. i really am trying to heal myself everyday. i try to be as joyful as i can, i blast some heavy riffs through my headphones and headbang as hard as i can, i am actually flirting again with girls...but god damn, i went through so much abuse that no matter how much i fight against my mind, i always remember that i was emotionnally and sexually toyed with. i am also fighting for my baby, but jesus this is really hard. i have outlived mental and sexual abuse, i have outlived working at am while my baby kept me awake until am. but can i really win this god damn fight ? i do not know.	severe
is anyone just a void? st post there are so many layers to my depression, like there are to anyones, so i wi will focus on the now with a little background. i was a very shy kid with a lot of anxiety and i was sinking into depression by the end of elementary school. things just escalated by the end of high school and now college. i was always going through everything alone, handling everything by myself, and the reasons for that would be a whole other post. the thing is, i am really functioning, like you wouldn t tell i was suicidal and severely depressed, i come off more as an asshole. i also never had some traumatic event which could have been a trigger for all of this, although one could argue a thousand little traumas can do a lot of damage as well. me functioning as i do and the lack of visible damage has always led me to thread this line of where i am not sure if i am making all of this up or if it is real, which could also be a whole other post ha. but the thing i wanted to ask, just to find someone who feels like this, is anyone just empty? like, i joined the gym last summer after around years of wanting to go, but my anxiety being a huge roadblock. i am planning a pilgri amage and hike a lot as it is. i study to get good grades and so on, my point being i seemingly have goals and ambition. but i just feel like a void. i see no point in anything life offers. when i set my mind for something i just wait for it to be completed and then i move on, almost completely thissociating from this thing, no matter how joyful it was. i feel detached from the world, i zone out a lot. i feel nothing i do during the day is a valid justification for me to be alive, like i am wasting ti ame and space. i am not looking for sympathies or anything, i just felt like writing this to see if someone can relate. there were so many ti ames i was so much worse and writing smth like this could have maybe helped, but writing calmly like this now makes me feel i would not just delete this in minutes. just posting this is out of my comfort zone, but fuck it. ps i am seeing a psychologist, i was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication for a while but stopped because it made things worse. and i understand why everything is happening and how it is linked as much as one can . it is just that in spite all of this it is like i just do not care, all is irrelevant. and in that irrelevance i sti will try and do, just in ways to di aminish my existence.	severe
it does not go away i have been dealing with depression since childhood, and like most of you here i had periods where i felt it less, someti ames i felt it more. for rhe last few months i have done what i actually like in life, found a gf, travelled and got an interesting job. this has thistracted me from the fact that i am depressed. but on those days with not much to do it just comes back and crushes me. that deep feeling of wanting to just die or thisappear rushes back and it is all i can think about. and that single thought makes the next week miserable. i thought i was cured, but nope, it does not seem to go away. has anyone really gotten away with it or is it just me that stays in this situation ?	severe
mental health in this country sucks long story short, i ran out of anti depressants and it took days for them to be refi willed. today is the th day. the zapping in my head was unbearable. i was so dizzy, i could barely walk. i could feel the looseness in my brain.. like i could not control what i was saying. emotions were high. i got a call that the meds were ready for pickup but i was at work and as i had just had my performance review the day before it was not good i did not want to leave. i tried to hold on for as long as i could but then i made an excuse about health issues and bolted. i know i wi will probably get into trouble. i do not care. i could not handle it this brain shake. i took the meds in the parking lot of the pharmacy and almost got into major road rage on my way home. i am not an angry driver. ever. i was in such bad shape when i got home, i called the nami hotline. i have never done this before. they said i should call the hour line. i just needed someone to be on the phone while the meds made their way into my system or i would hurt myself or someone else. the woman on the other end basically chastised me for letting my meds relapse. then mins in, she told me she was the only person on and had to take another call. but we re open so call anyti ame. damn.	severe
anyone in here experience hallucinations from medication? i have been on sertraline for a while now and it is been working great. i am super productive, i am having way more success with the ladies etc etc. however earlier this week i awoke with closed eye hallucinations. not unpleasant or anything, and it only lasted for a few minutes. sti will, anyone else experience this? if it happens again i wi will probably contact my doctor	severe
sinking into depression again i had depression for about four years but i am pretty sure i recovered around last year but nowadays its gettong harder and harder for me to get out of bed. i am starting to withdraw from any social situations too. i am just watching myself sink back into depression and i can not stop it. i really dont want to go through this again, it took me a lot of recover the last ti ame. i honestly feel really sick about going through this again	severe
i think i m depressed again i am too sedated off the meds the hospital gave me to even care about spelling errors or whatever. i been thru too much to even type. i recently got thischarged from the hospital after months and a half after a manic episode and once again. i am alone, i used social media to cope with my i willness and so many people turned their backs on me cause of it. i am starting to see the world for what it really is. my family is supporting me thru this transitional period in my life but i am scared because i have to actually work on myself all over again from square one. this is way harder than i thought but man coping with all the shit i dealt with in and out the hospital is hard. i dont know if i can do all this.	severe
i feel just about done. no social services in my country, gregarious adoptive mother who never so much as lets me out of the house seriously yet is ski willed at looking like she cares deeply about me while she neglects my being and health in favor of fucking herp derp study study study all the ti ame. faculty just think i should work harder or tell me to nut up or are close to her. i wouldn t have anything to speak to with others even if i could i have little in common with anyone in this place. tried therapy... tried exercise... tried relaxing. actually they do work, but i just can not stay consistently doing any of them for very long until another health problem or some fucking college family bullshit comes up. i have add too, so hahahah doing anything that requires thiscipline. when i graduate i wi will have spent goddamn years of life in this institution, if i never have to study for another fucking exam again it wi will sti will be too soon. teachers have interminable classes and drone on and have their material scattered all over the place, making everything difficult, and then blame me when i do poorly. yeah yeah work is worse, blah blah. that is not motivating me. my goals drift away while all this abuse continues. the worst is trying to put on a mask for other people and pretend like i am not depressed because mother dearest bitches at me or acts sad if i try to indulge in the basic pleasure of openly hating my life, as that one youtuber put it. the only consolation is that i am one of those insane child prodigies that entered the system years early, so i have not lost that much ti ame. it probably did more harm than good, in the end. i have two rotten molars that have been that way for almost a decade and a left ear that is had some kind of issue for a few months and anyti ame i bring this up she meanders and finds some way to put it off. but she hangs on every teacher is every word. sick of her shit. sick of being shoved around, and sick of my only outlets being games, jerking off and reading terrible people is terrible opinions online. i tried writing a short story i even finished it, submitted it, got rejected narrowly. my motivation to work after that went to zero just starting to rebuild it now. someti ames i find comfort and something like thri will in fun media, good food or evenhobbies, but it does not last long because that is how the human mind works. what my mother is doing is probably i willegal, but i have no way of proving she does not let me out of the house physically blocked my way once and took my phone , and if i tried to talk to someone beside my therapist, in meatspace, about my abuse they would probably think i mean physical abuse. i have ocd as well, because fuck me, and i treat every manmade surface as potentially contaminated which means i can not eat out properly anyhow. all these issues have been there for years, but it is only last year i realized my mother was abusive and it is only in the past few months that it is gotten truly grave. i tried as hard as i could to study and keep up but it just was not enough and i got another kick in the shins when the teacher said my assignments the ones i worked so long on were worth a small portion of the final grade. i have finally had enough, and i am starting to thisengage from reality. the thing i look forward to most at this point is sleeping my dreams can be terrifying or tense, but at least the constant background of pain and low level self hatred is not there. i am tired of being a self contradictory mess ideologically, i am tired of my past mistakes, and i am most of all tired of trying to cli amb out of the pit just to have my hands slashed. if there were an easy and convenient method of suicide like a fast working poison available to me, i would likely have taken it. easier than trying and failing to get better for the next forty or fifty years. there. that is my rant.	severe
persistent depressive thisorder i suspect i am suffering from dysthymia for some ti ame now and i only learned about it some days ago. all the symptoms match. i feel no satisfaction or pleasure in life although i am sti will able to work, have social interactions and lead an apparent normal life. even the things i always liked such as play bass, sing, video games or reading give me no satisfaction. i sti will do these things but in auto mode . besides the lack of satisfaction, i feel enraged. all the ti ame. everything pisses me of literally. this is going now for a year or so, i think. i went to a psychologist for the first ti ame last week and since it was my first appointment, nothing was done. we just talked and i did not know that there was this condition then. i just told her that i feel my life lost its meaning. so next week i tell her about this dysthymia thing and hear what she has to say. what bothers me the most is that this is really not helping my relationship. i live with my so for four years now and she is also struggling with depression. she has the classic depression sadness, anxiety and some episodes of panic attack but she is seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for some ti ame and undergoing treatment. however, if she had emotional support from her so, things would be much better for her, i believe. i do not feel like being around her anymore. we occasionally watch something together or play some board games i am always in auto mode when doing these things but that is all. we do not talk much as before and it is been two months since we had sex, and i feel absolutely nothing about this. i really do not care. today things got worse. we argued when she said i do not give her attention. she is right about this. however, i am si amply not able to give her attention or love. i wanted to show her love but i can not. if i did it would be fake. it would be in auto mode and i do not believe this would help. i am really dead on the inside. i just told her i feel nothing for her and i am not feeling sad about this nor angry, nothing. she is devastated but said she prefer to hear the truth. i almost left home but she convinced me to stay. told her to go look for someone else who could actually give her some emotional support. she said that she can not do that. it would be wrong to leave me when i also need help and she sti wills loves me. this can not continue. i must try to do something. i want to feel alive again. anyone here has been diagnosed with dysthymia or maybe feel the same way as i do? have you tried to do something about it?	severe
i just can not i think this night is the night, i can not see a tomorrow. everything has turned to shit, i thought poeple cared about me but they do not, i do not know why i thought they did. my dad just screamed at me for getting sad about something he said, he made me sound ungreatfull for everything he is done to help my depression, he said he is scared to say anything to me anymore. and i can not live with that, i tought he enjoyed talking with me but in reality he did not, he does not care, no one does and why would they. i do not even know why i should post this, no one gives a fuck. i was dumb to every think i would get a future. i do not know how to live further than this point. the doctors do not care, i have not even started therapy yet, i have waited months on it but no one gives a shit, they do not give a shit about me. even the fucking suicide hotline would not answer. i do not know if i am strong enough to survive the night.	severe
not being able to talk on the phone is keeping me from getting help... i am f and i have suffered from depression and anxiety for most of my life. something that i ampacts this greatly is the fact that my mom and i have never really been financially stable. for a while we had health insurance through her work, but the company she worked for went out of business and she decided to go back to school she worked in retail and that just was not cutting it anymore . then, i was sti will barely under , so i qualified for government healthcare, but that soon got cut off. last year my mom graduated and got a job in her field, she makes okay money, but they do not offer health insurance. she does not make enough for us to afford private health insurance, but she sti will makes too much for us to qualify for any sort of government aid. however, i recently got into a program where they provide strictly mental healthcare for people of low socioeconomic status. i started off just seeing a psychiatrist so i could go back on my medications. however other health problems have popped up, i started college this year, and i am planning on starting out on my own soon, so my psychiatrist recommended i request a case manager. basically this would just be a person i can contact to help me with things. they can help me apply for healthcare when i move out, they can help me find a therapist, etc. well i did all that. for some reason i have no problem talking to people in person? so now i have a case manager and all i have to do is call her and set up a fucking appointment and i fucking can not??????????? like i don t understand myself. i know what my problems are. i know how to fix them. i have the resources at my thisposal. i just have such bad anxiety talking to people on the phone! and i tried to text her but she would not respond, she just ends up calling me and i freak out and do not answer. what do i do. someone help me.	severe
cutting every single ti ame i try to quite cutting my self someone or some thing comes and makes me so depressed that i go right back to it	severe
experience with prescribers? long ti ame lurker, first ti ame poster here. some backstory to my questions i went through counseling with a therapist two years ago, for an overall period of about a year. i had weekly sessions to start and trailed down to once a month once i was feeling able to manage my thoughts a bit better. i stopped going when i felt like it was no longer beneficial and that i did not get enough out of the sessions. i did actually enjoy seeing this therapist unlike a previous one years ago . in the last session we spoke about potential next steps, and i mentioned that i would be wi willing to try medicine to try to even out my mood. my therapist said that medicine can work for some people and not for others. he recommended a nearby prescriber , basically a psychiatrist instead of a therapist. some therapy is sti will involved but less frequently, and more as a quick check than a full session those are shorter as ti ame goes on . he cautioned that they generally do not accept insurance and can be very expensive. i am experiencing symptoms of depression again, and in the back of my mind i know i need help. there are some persistent thoughts that i have not been able to shake in addition to general feelings that i can feel are not really me. has anybody had experiences seeing a prescriber or psychiatrist specifically for medicine in order to try resolving their symptoms? it feels odd to seek out a doctor in order to try medicine, but i guess that is what we all do when we re sick. please let me know if it was beneficial to you, if you learned anything useful, or even if it was not for you and why. i know it is ti ame to get help but i also feel that it may be ti ame to try something different. thank you guys for reading and for your thoughts!	severe

i feel like my meds are not working anymore i have been on cymbalta and lamictal for close to two years and now i am on abilify. i went through countless antidepressants with crazy side effects before finally being put on cymbalta. i felt great for pretty much up until a few weeks ago. the abilify really helped but now i just feel like i am missing something. i am so tired and just find no desire to move. everything is dragging. i do not really feel depressed but i feel like it is leading up to it. everything is just slowly becoming what it was before i actually got help and i do not know what to do. i am scared to start changing up meds and go through the cycle of finding the right ones all over again	severe

i am committing suicide really soon, earlier than i had planned long story short, going to repeat it once more so to those who are reading this, can really incapsulate this. i am male, i have gone through ect procedures shock therapy and tms sessions it is like a jackhammer woodpecker to the temple i have since given up on both of my therapists, emotionally and mentally exhausted as fuck. people who say they care they wi will be here for me, i can tell they are just straight up tired of hearing from me because i am so mentally exhausting. i have got no passion, no sense of direction, i give up fast and get overwhelmed easily. the trial and error of prescription psychiatric medication along with the process of taking meds of weeks for it to be at a therapeutic level, just the thought of up makes me even more hopeless than i already am. i am beyond depression, so beyond that i am not committing suicide because of that, i am committing suicide because i no longer wish to live anymore. my world is cold, gri am, bleak, empty. there is no more of that warmth feeling of home. i am a shell of what i used to be. of that shock therapy procedures and tms sessions, my conscious has depleted, and the conscious i am left with is torturing me every single fucking day. i am being reminded of every single bad thing that had happened to me, every single thing people had said to amp about me. the world would honestly be very much so a hell of a lot great,beater, and brighter without me! committing suicide wi will be single handily the greatest decision and accomplishment i have ever done. thanks for reading	severe

i have never experienced true happiness looking back on life, i always thought i was a happy kid. but now that i am older, i realised that i was never happy one minute of my life. i was born into a destructive family, both parents being chronic alcoholics, and too wasted to care for me or my siblings. when i was my dad suffered from a heart attack and died. my mother was incapable of looking after any of us and we were put up for adoption. i was placed into a house where both parents hated one another and divorced one month after i arrived. i stayed in that house for years, and in i left because i was being abused and treated like an object. she would threaten to kick me out of the house if i misbehaved, and at one point threw me out on the side of the road for something or other. i was like a slave. i did all the household chores, cooked, cleaned... i had no ti ame to socialize which has come back and bit me in the ass now. i attempted to ki will myself while i was there, but failed. i did not have any friends, so no one could comfort me when i was feeling like shit. whenever i was at school, i was the weird kid always alone, talked to myself probably insanity , and somewhat schizophrenic. i never felt safe anywhere, and as a result i can not trust anyone now. when i moved schools in , i was partially excited because no one liked me in my previous school. but it is so much worse. in the the last three years students have made fun of the way i live, made fun of my looks, and i have had death threats on countless occasions by numerous people. again i tried to ki will myself because i was not taking anyone is shitty insults anymore. i got real close to slicing my neck open until i was caught and sent to hospital. someti ames i question why i am sti will here if i am just going to be beat down by almost everyone i meet. and i sti will have no friends to talk to about these things. it sucks. life sucks. i suck.	severe
i can not deal with my guilt and i am exhausted. i have been depressed and an anxious mess for the last years. have always been struggling with it but after a back injury which left me with chronic pain for a year about years ago, i went off the deep end and made some reckless choices. my marriage was going through a lot of turmoil, she cheated, i cheated, we divorced. i drank and slept around to make myself feel better and while i felt alive for a while, i crashed and burned. even though we both cheated and are better off not together, i sti will feel so terrible for cheating and for breaking up with her. shes engaged and happy again and has forgiven my transgressions, but i sti will can not forgive myself. i would never cheated on anyone else before and it tears me up inside thinking how i hurt her at the ti ame so badly. feel like a monster. i have been with someone new for a few years now and shes great, but she deals with depression too. i want nothing more to be happy but i find myself resenting her negativity, even though i am the same way i suppose. its sick. i am sick. it makes me guilty feeling like i can not deal with her emotions someti ames. dont get me started on work...i have i amposter syndrome every single day and i am exhausted faking it. i am so tired of all this...ssri is dont seem to do anything. i can never stick with therapy, i do or sessions and think my therapist sucks and is just giving me stupid handouts and barely listening. its gotten to the point where i can not even read a book anymore, i read a few pages and then get lost in negative thoughts about my life. i have amazing friends and great supportive parents. it could all be so much worse. and yet i am not happy. how can i forgive myself?	severe
it is back months of taking medication already. i felt that i was getting better at one point then this week, things started feeling different again. i noticed my mind was not as sharp, small tasks would make me anxious again, and i am starting to dread the future because all i can think of are possible problems i wi will have to deal with. it is not as bad as back then.. but it sti will is not a good place to be. i am getting tired and i am probably nearing burning out from work again. i feel so much shame and guilt because everyone seems to be doing okay, and here i am, looking like i am incapable of doing certain tasks without spiraling. i can not wait to see my therapist again. just wanted to rant.	severe
i can not stop thinking about suicide i have persistent suicidal ideation, but as ti ame passes i am realizing that these thoughts are actually giving me what little comfort i have. these thoughts are in constant conflict of reminding how miserable i am while si amultaneously giving me the comfort of having some modicum of control. at least i have the ability to go out on my own terms if nothing else. i am not actively planning to do it or anything, but it is at the point where i am uncomfortable if it is not on my mind. i am so tired of feeling this way	severe
need advice on keeping my motivation when i want to set goals and actually doing them. i have ocd and depression and someti ames i find it so difficult to do the things that i enjoy. my goal for this year was to learn how to draw, i have always liked it but i do not know how, so i bought an online drawing course, my other goal was to make youtube videos, at first the first few weeks were great but slowly i started not taking the classes or just recording for youtube but loosing motivation when it came to edit the videos. its so difficult for me to do this two tasks that i set as goals, i find it more easy to stay in bed and browse the web than to actually get up and do something. i someti ames start to edit videos but mid way i just give up. what can i do? how can i achive this tasks without letting my thoughts tell me naaah ?	severe
feeling down i used to take ssris, but due to some personal issues, i weaned myself off in december. well, it was rough, really rough but i felt fine after awhile, but today i guess i am just having an off day. i am stressed, but i just cry so easily which is a complete from how i used to be over everything. especially today. i just felt on the brink of tears many ti ames, then i finally got home, was triggered over my dogs destroying my house while i was gone, and just broke down. i feel empty inside. i know i have a lot to be happy about, but i just feel really down. i miss my friends and i would love to not be in serious debt. just feeling really sad. kind of hopeless. honestly, during my interview earlier, a trigger was brought up, which may be part of the reason also. thanks for reading.	severe

just empty and hollow i just feel empty and hollow, it is not that i am not doing stuff, it is just that i do not feel the i ampact of anything i am doing. cool stuff sucks and does not feel like anything. good things happen in life but i feel nothing from those things. i buy something new and i feel nothing. it is like being served your favorite dessert but when you take a bite it has no flavor. i just focus on how painful things are.	severe
i am not sure if the weed is helping or hurting i have been depressed since i was . i found weed around . i finally had a job and was just using my money to buy weed and real versions of toys that would fall apart from the dollar store but that is beside the point. the weed helped mellow me out alot. it is been years now. i spend like dollars every few days. when i dont have it i become irritable, argumentative and just down right mean. once i finally come down fully i just dont feel much. i just kind of run through the motions with my negative self talk. then i turn. talking too much about nothing to the point of arguing because i just want to connect with someone on anything. hot flashes on my upper body and chi wills on my spine cold enough i have to shake it off after. drooling uncontrollably. extreme self seclusion because i dont know how to act in public beyond trying not to cause issues or fights. i just dont cope beyond avoidance of the situation entirely. and to be honest i suspect i might be on the spectrum when it comes to some of my behavior but it could also be my childhood abuse doing weird things to my brain. i dont know. but once i have the weed. i feel like a sharp ball of nails melting into a passive ball of just not caring. but with the less i care about my anxiety and depression the less i care about anything else and end up barely getting anything done. my parents hate the smell and that i spend so much on it. i have to get it through my little brother so i am also burdening every few days. and to top it all off i have never seen a doctor for anything mentally related so i am just kind of in the wind on this. i hate coming down and all the sneaking to get it. but i also do not want to be on medications so i do not really know what to do except keep smoking.	severe
same day i have been having some adverse reactions towards my therapist lately. in december we took a break from our relationship because we both had things to do. when i came back i was really anxious. i had never been so anxious seeing her. i thought that the anxiety would go away but it always come back. whether i call to schedule an appointment with her, think about my appointment with her the night before my appointment, while waiting for my appointment in the lobby, during our sessions and after my anxiety ramps up. when i get text message reminders that i have my appointment with her, i become nauseous and i dont want to eat. my last session with her my voice was shaking. she told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. since last week all i have been thinking about is that sessions and that gives me anxiety. i took it personal when my therapist changed her availability and made herself unavailable by choosing to work four hour days. this makes me think that she dosent want to work or even worse does not want to see me. she has told me in our previous sessions that i am always free to call as long as its during office hours. when i am in crisis, my first thought isnt going to be is if she is in office or not. i called last week for an appointment during the same day because i was unable to make an appointment last week in advance and i saw her that day. when i got there both of the receptionists and my therapist told me that they dont do same day appointments. this was the first that i had ever heard of that. both of the receptionist told me that i was able to make a same day appointment before which made me really confused. i feel like they all hate me. i do not really know where this is coming from. i was expecting the anxiety to go away by now.	severe
my life choices are messing me up short backstory i am a guy who was doing fine. i lived in a good city, got my bachelor is degree and could just do more year of part ti ame studying to get a job with a good wage. had a girlfriend, lived together, i went to the gym almost every day and i felt great about myself. then i decided to move to the u.k for a year to do a master is degree in something that i may or may not get a job within back in my home country. mind you that i already had a student loan of dollars k, now i borrowed an additional dollars k to come here. for what? i am a supporter of the football team that resides here, i have followed them since i was a kid. relationship was a bit unstable at the ti ame so my best response was to flee breakup was not bad at all, sti will friends . now i am sitting in my ridiculously small, crazy expensive student is accommodation, i live with people who are years younger than me, all my friends from uni are working all the ti ame and the course i am doing is not at all what i thought it would be i only have a few months left and my master is thissertation that i may be able to do from home . i regret coming here, my social life is a mess and i miss my friends and family back home everything about my home country really . i have suffered depressions before due to i willness in the family as well as bullying when i was a kid, but i thought i was done with this. i had worked myself up to a respectable social life, lots of friends. i had shed my excess weight, i looked good and felt good. now i wi will sit in my room and procrastinate, eating the cheap candy they sell here i come from a very expensive country , playing videogames. i finish all of my assignments at the last second. i am constantly thinking about going home but with the financial commitment i have made to come here, it would ki will my parents or rather, they would ki will me . i do not know what to do. i feel the relapse coming, all my negative thoughts about myself are constantly weighing me down and it has made me a lazy slob. the first thing people said when i went home for christmas was that i had put on weight. and how right they are. i just needed to vent my thoughts, do not expect all the response in the world, but any advice would be appreciated. have a lovely day. tl dr my life was wonderful, i moved abroad and i feel like my depressions are returning because i think i made the wrong choice.	severe
online prescription renewal? i sorely need my antidepressant prescription renewed but i can not go back to my old psychiatrist or make another appointment that fits my work schedule to save my life literally . i have been on this antidepressant for nearly a decade and i really need it now do i have any other options for renewal, like online? i am surprised it is so hard, even with good insurance.	severe
as predicted, the doctor was a complete waste of ti ame i had a bad feeling that i was wasting my ti ame and it turns out...yep that was right so apparently whatever is wrong with me is too severe to be seen by my original provider so they referred me to an outside provider. cool. after a series of hoops and headaches i get an appointment. changed my work schedule so i could make it because there was not a promise i would be able to reschedule soon. came into my job at am so i could get there on ti ame without losing hours at work. my appointment was supposed to be with a woman...but apparently that was changed without notifying me. i definitely would have cancelled in that case but whatever, i was already there. get in this dudes office and he i ammediately tells me that i have ptsd. that the depression is just a symptom of that. i am like ???? he says these are the types of things people with ptsd usually experience. i tell hi am i do not really experience that. he goes on about ptsd. i ask, so did my original provider send something over that makes you say that? he said no, they didnt send over anything related to my care. keeps talking about ptsd. says he sees lots of people with it and he is ex military so he knows but i have never been seen by you before??? then he says he is not really into medication ???? says he believes in holistic approaches like herbs, acupuncture and the whatnot w a combination of therapy. says he wi will refer me to therapist intake. i was clear that i wanted to go the medication route and was not interested in herbs . he says well if you re sure we can do a swab test and maybe start you on a small dose of zoloft but other things would be better. i said i would take the swab. so he says sure, but i wi will also put you down for therapist intake ??? so i leave and he gives his instructions to the nurse. once he is gone i tell her under no circumstances do i want to be seen by hi am again i said i did not want a therapist intake there and just please give me a prescription so i can go. so she says sure...then sends my prescription to a walgreens to be fi willed. i leave...head to the walgreens...and the pharmacist goes...didnt they tell you? we dont accept your insurance. you have to have this fi willed with your original provider. ...no, no one told me that. it is after pm. i call them and they are closed. he says you can sti will pick this up, but you have to pay out of pocket. i call my original provider and they are like, well yeah obviously we have to write your prescription and fi will it then what was i referred for??????? . i asked if they knew the doctor they had me see was selling herbalife and snake oil on the side. they said they go through a third party for referrals, there is a lot of doctors in the system. at this point i am standing in the middle of a walgreens near tears. not depression tears mind you, rage tears. i just paid for it out of pocket because i wanted to go home. oh and by the way my insurance would not rei amburse me. because according to them someone should have known where to send the rx. so fuck me i guess. but i can not take it because i am definitely not going back to that place to have it refi willed and i need someone to tell me why i can not just been seen by my original provider. this has been such bullshit. i feel like i would have just been better off coming home from work and going to sleep like i always do. like what is the point of making this shit as hard as fucking possible??? what is the point	severe
today is the worst it is been in a while i have acknowledged my depression since high school and it was the main cause of me dropping out early. i am now and i have finished trade school since then. i am proud of what few actual accomplishments i have made throughout my life, but it is always felt like a part of life has been missing for me. i have never felt wanted by someone. both of my parents were mentally abusive all throughout my childhood and teenage years. today i have been in my head a little more than my normal amount and it is making it hurt worse. this would not accomplish anything for me but it feels good to post my feelings somewhere.	severe

abilify added to meds so i have been taking lexapro mg for about years. recently my doctor added abilify and it is helped tremendously. i have energy and a sex drive and i am way happier. i have noticed a little though i can not sit sti will and i think i am starting to get heart palpitations from it. i have severe anxiety and depression so now i am freaked out i am going to die in my sleep. i am a pretty healthy year old female but i do have sleep apnea. that is the only thing wrong with me. i am so nervous now that even though abilify is working, i do not know if it wi will be worth the side effects. i am also nervous of dying any advice would help. i see my doctor in a couple of weeks.	severe

how do you make yourself understand that you actually have depression? i just got diagnosed with depression but have felt like this for years. i would always think to myself that there is no way i have depression and even now after my paediatrician diagnosed me i feel like i was just exaggerating. this would make it worse because i would hate on myself for faking to be depressed and that other people have it so much worse. how can i make it so i stop doing this?	severe
floating sensory deprivation tanks i have been on different ssris, i have been seeing therapists since i was , and my depression has not let up. i have dysthymia, but have found myself in another major depressive episode and dropped out of university days ago. i am now on the path to taking the ti ame out of my life to put a conscious effort in getting my mental health on track. i want to exist in harmony with my depression, so i have been trying to find natural therapeutic techniques to cope with these really bad episodes. today, i tried floating in a sensory deprivation tank and it was absolutely incredible. i spent hours in there, and it made me realize that i have absolutely no ti ame to think. taking ti ame out of your life every once in a while to think about who you are and what you need to do provides so much clarity. i felt so at peace for those hours, i wanted to cry having to leave because i know the outside world is full of so much pain. but, the benefit is that i now feel better equipped than i did yesterday to conquer this pain. anyone out there who is reading this, and suffering, there is no harm in trying a float tank. if you re into psychedelics, i really recommend doing a float under the influence of mushrooms or mdma to push the li amits of your mind. it helped me when i thought nothing else could, i hope maybe it can do that for you as well.	severe
i just want to take one magic pi will to cure me for good. i am currently going through therapy and learning techniques to help me cope with depressions. but it just sucks to know i wi will have to battle this nearly every day for the rest of my life. nothing wi will make me stop feeling this way for good. i am so fucking exhausted.	severe
i am losing touch with reality f usa. i think i am too far gone with my depression. i know i have felt like this before, but there is something in me that is telling me that this ti ame is different. it is torture having to breathe and live each day when i do not see the point in it anymore. the same every day, i wake up, go to work, come home, do my thing for a few hours, go to sleep, and repeat. i live paycheck to paycheck and sti will past due on every bi will, i have no friends as of recently that i sti will see, i sti will live with my family which is a mess and i often have to care for them. i am always being talked over and overlooked and ignored.. the things in my life worth fighting for are gone now, except for my cats and dogs, which would be cared for by the rest of my family if something were to happen to me. i love them dearly but i am getting too tired to keep pouring from an empty glass. i could just slip off the earth and it wouldn t really make a difference. i am taking it all in and can not let it out, it is not overflowing but it is drowning me. nobody can hear me. please, if you have the ti ame just tell me you can hear me. i know you can not fix my problems, but please please let me know i am not invisible, because it sure as heck feels like i am.. not just metaphorically, i have been dealing with a bad case of derealization thissociation the past few months and i am losing touch with reality.	severe
i am going to therapy tmrw! first ti ame and i am super nervous! what should i be expecting?	severe
a mysterious void welp idek at this point. i feel dead and alive at the same ti ame, i am majorly depressed on some days and alright on others. my therapist is sending me to get checked out for antidepressants but i do not know about anything anymore. what if i am doing fine? am i ok? i really do not know. i do not even know myself and it is honestly so confusing and difficult. does anyone know anything???? eeeeek	severe
going to go back to therapy i used to see a therapist but, there were a few events that happened where i could not continue therapy. firstly i had a controlling partner who knew i needed therapy but would sti will occupy my ti ame, or purposely make it so i could not make my appointments. this person would also contribute to my mental health getting worse and would soon start to abuse me. secondly my therapist was only in his office two days a week, and was taking on a lot of new patients and could not find a ti ame that did not conflict with my schedule so he had to refer me to someone else. thirdly i lost my job and health insurance so i could not afford therapy. well i am no longer in that relationship, and i got a new job and was eligible for state medicaid so i can start going to a doctor to get back on the antidepressants i was taking and find a new therapist. sadly, thanks to my ex i am not only talking about my depression i am also talking about the trauma and hell they put me through while i was with them.	severe
do not know what to do anymore i m have been dealing with major depression since i was in th grade. it was kinda bad then, but i got better for a ti ame. my first semester at college was rough, but i got through it and was fine again. i am now in my second semester of sophomore year and my depression worse than it ever has been before. i come in and out of depressed states, but my roommates have been finding me staring off, unresponsive. while in those states, i can hear them yelling my name, and i do not know if it is that i do not care to answer or i physically can not. these last few days, all i can do is sleep and stare at my arm, i amagining taking my razor to it. i know it is wrong and i do not think i want to do it, i do not want to do it to my family, but the only place i can i amagine myself in the future is either dead or being so depressed i can not function. i have been seeing therapist, but it is not helping, my meds no longer help and it is a struggle to keep taking them... i do not know what i should do, my grades are horrible because of this, which does not help. i really do not want to go to the hospital, but i also do not want to fully loose the little keeping me from offing myself. i just want my mind to be quite. all i want is peace and normal thinking.	severe
my fucked up brain i knew i had a fucked up brain for a while, but i recently went back to therapy and was told that i have severe major depressive thisorder and it felt... nice. it is nice to have someone give a name to your fucked up feelings. i have always been afraid that i was just overreacting or did not really have real problems, but it is real. do not get me wrong, i am sti will sad as shit, but at least my sadness has a name.	severe
i have been trying to find peace i feel miserable i feel so alone i felt alone all my life my parents who i love are not even close to me they kinda pushed us away when they were really strict and used to beat us. i have very vague conversations with them and it is in a robotic tone nobody talks about it but it is there. i feel like a failure as a son that i can not even talk to my parents about how was their day i get anxious and uneasy around them. i do not have any friends, i do not have a job and i do not have a a girl who i can call mine and show love and affection towards my heart is cold now i rarely even smile and i feel ugly. i miss when i was a kid......this depression and anxiety caused me to start smoking weed and the only ti ame i feel a sense of peace or joy is when i am stoned but even then i am sti will anxious and depressed. now i am struggling to find a job i am at home all day feeling miserable my family is not close anymore i recently learned my sister is suicidal to. i feel so sad and lonely and kinda angry.	severe
getting things off your chest are supposedly good so here goes mine i have started to realize that i have had depression and anxiety since i was a kid i just did not know what that odd feeling was. my depression started ever since my parents fought when i was younger than years old. my dad being micromanaging alcoholic person who used to hit my mom because he wanted to be with another woman. my mom and myself getting kicked out of our house and forces to move in with my mothers relatives who used to blame me for all my parents issues. my mother having enough of my dads crazy shit and going with another man. me being forgotten by my parents and my older brothers, feeling like i am less worthy than everyone else for anything. being told i am not good enough constantly, being cheated on multiple ti ames, being played for being a nice person. having depression for growing in a bad area where people get ki willed daily and life goes on. having depression, stress and poor sleeping patterns from being in the military and a prior firefighter. it is hard for me to connect with people but i wi will give my life to help others.	severe
when depression starts to take over your life... f i wrote this earlier today. maybe you can relate. please take the ti ame to read it... most days i feel nothing at all. i can not cry, i do not laugh, i am just numb. then there are days like this where i feel everything at once, yet i sti will feel silenced by it all. the feeling of being suffocated by deep sadness. it is as though everything has no purpose and i can not find myself to accomplish anything. you know deep down you mean so much to so many people but it is clouded by the thoughts. nothing seems logical. it is days like these where i feel restrained by my own self and yet again i let another day go to waste. i do not eat, i did not shower or brush my teeth, my hair is in the same bun i put it in before i went to sleep last night. there is nothing worse in this world than being stuck in your own head. you re told it can go away but it has not. it is a constant battle within yourself. after you get over the mountain of depression, you hate yourself even more for not being able to control it sooner. you do not know how to ask for help because no one really understands how you feel. so you suffer in silence over and over again. this is my problem that i should be able to take control of, but i can not and i have not so i continue to live through it ti ame after ti ame. you stop answering texts and calls, you cancel plans and no one knows it is because of how depressed you are. you come up with excuse after excuse on why you can not make it. i know i need help but what is a therapist going to say differently this ti ame? the thought of driving over to talk and feel the exact same leaves me even more hopeless. calling the doctor to change my medication because it is not working is a big task that i do not want to go through driving to her, trying a new medication, experiencing new side effects, spending more money that i do not have because i call out of work so often since i can not get out of bed. i feel defeated and mentally exhausted. some nights i am awake, tossing and turning, hoping i wi will be able to put my mind at ease but i end up suffering from insomnia. when i finally do sleep, i wake up late and am thisappointed with myself for sleeping and wasting half my day that could have been used to pick up the slack from the previous days when i was paralyzed from depression. other nights i sleep hours. it is like i can not win. how are you supposed to feel when depression is taking over your life? you re close to losing your job, your grades are terrible, you physically do not take care of yourself anymore. not to mention all the things you used to love to do, you can not find the energy or passion anymore. this is when you start to fantasize about death. it just seems so promising. no more suffering. you can finally escape the constant sadness. is there really a better answer? wi will i ever understand what true happiness feels like? people tell you there is hell out there but it is only temporary. the vicious cycle seems to pick right back up, especially when you least expect it. does not matter where you are, all you want to do is go right back in your bed, alone, away from everyone and everything isolated one your own sadness. as i write this, i realize i need help and i want help but i have done it all before yet i am sti will here, worse than i was before. it is like depression evolves as ti ame goes on and one day it wi will be too much to handle. that is when you know you can not fight anymore.	severe
why is it back??? i found happiness for a while. years really. i had very few ti ames i thought that i desperately needed something to change or i could not keep going. but for the last few days depression is back with no explanation at all. i know something is terribly wrong with me but i do not have a clue why. was it the show i was watching that was a little thisappointing or the stress of my rent going up? i have bipolar so i should not be shocked i guess but it is been so well in control for so long because my kids are great and my love for them brings happiness. these last days though i can not get myself into mommy mode at all. i feel devastated, like there is no future to look forward to, and that i wish i could tun off my brain and wake up next to one of my old friends that ditched me a while ago who i used to tell everything to....i am pathetic i know. maybe that is ok but it hurts.	severe
listened into my moms convo with my lazy brother and now i am somehow lower than i was before i am too tired to write out my whole backstory but long story short i have had bad depression since i was now , i am really good at hiding and bottling up my emotions so mom does not notice most of the ti ame. i told her a few years ago that the incidents of my middle school haunt me everyday and that i have depression. she put me up on some vitamins and told me i need to exercise more. i have only seemed to get worse as the years have gone on. i used to be able to work through it and keep going with it just on the back burner until i was alone in bed at night with my brain. nowadays, i am unfocused. i wi will lay down for bed and realise i do not remember my full day of work and school. today i woke up and realised i forgot to shower for an entire week. i am spiralling really bad and so this past monday i asked my mom if i could get professional help. we talked for a long ti ame and we set me up with a therapist that i wi will start seeing within the next month. i have never gotten professional help or medicine for that matter the entire ti ame i have been going through this. anyway, i have ranted a bit too much. basically, about an hour ago, i heard my brother , unemployed, cliche lazy guy who plays games all day complaining about having to start work for the first ti ame in months soon. mom went off on a tangent about how his laziness has led hi am into this funk and how he would not be able to handle the hard work of his upcoming job bc he is gotten so used to laying around all day. then, i hear my name. she starts to say that the reason he and i are having mental problems is because we both did not have jobs during last semester and got so used to gaming everyday. which is only half true. i play games when i can, but i have fallen off of it more and more lately, as i have most things i was interested in she said lots of more shit, basically putting us in the same boat. talking about how laziness is bc this generation gets too comfortable or whatever. basically she just called us both lazy and blamed our funks on this laziness. i took pretty bad offence to it, as i am quite the opposite of lazy. even when i was unemployed last semester, i was sti will physically active, and i spent a lot of ti ame doing chores around the house or homework when i was not at school. my brother, on the other hand, wi will come in once a week with a huge ass pile of thishes from his room and dump them in the sink for someone else to do. he wakes up at pm everyday. i should add, he does not have any mental issues. he got into a lot of trouble fighting ppl in high school and he had to drop out and get his ged. there is nothing mentally or physically wrong with hi am, he is just extremely lazy and gets mad defensive if you try to ask hi am why he spent all week in bed and did not at least make more tea when he drinks the last bit, ya know? look, i do not despise hi am. i have accepted that he is that way, even if it is badly detri amental to his future. i stopped caring so much and just focused on my own goals. but ever since i heard my mom throw me in with that, i have started to realise that that is probably why she never got me professional help all these years for my depression. she just thinks i am lazy. i have gotten so much worse lately and i have not cut since i was but i found myself scratching at my arm until it bled and now i have started scratching at it when i find myself falling too deep. today at work i realised i would just been staring at the table below me for an hour straight and did not do a single thing. i dont know, it is fucked. i have not acted on my suicidal thoughts since i nearly attempted at mom does not know about that one and despite telling my mom this week literally exactly hey, i do not think i wi will live much longer if i do not get some serious help , she sti will thinks it is just some damn lazy crap because i have a hard ti ame getting out of bed in the morning. she is never had real depression so she does not get how hard it is to do the si amplest of things. if anyone is read this far, really what i am looking for is just some basic advice on how to get going without anyone around you believing what you have is real. i did not mean for this to turn into a rant. i have just been trying my hardest to be proud of myself for forcing myself out of bed everyday to go to work and school and it feels like she just shit on that, especially when she is saying this when she thinks i can not hear. i dont know. i am sorry.	severe
psychiatric hold made everything worse it is pretty much just prison. i saw the psychiatrist for less than a minute each day and all he would do is give me zoloft that did not help at all and no one really spoke to me. i am sti will having trouble even speaking about my experience months later. every night i was given valium and ambien even though i am not suppose to because of my sleep apnea. my psychiatrist had also agreed but they never bothered to contact hi am. i was not even suicidal! well not until i got out i just had a breakdown. i makes me never ever want to tell anyone that i am depressed because i am scared of being forced back there. my anxiety and ptsd is way worse now.	severe

i do not know what to do. hey um, good morning, my name is kevin. just, straight up, i feel like i have no direction in life. abruptly, i would like to begin by saying that i have been diagnosed, by a professional, with major depressive thisorder and post traumatic stress thisorder and that my family has a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, mental health issues and suicide and before going any further, i want to make it known that i do not have any suicidal thoughts or intentions to act on any thoughts of the sort. with that said, here is a bit of background to better help understand my situation. i live with my mother and my sister, i am years old, i graduated from high school years ago and went right into college and terms in, right out into the real world not having pulled through with my education. all of my education just public school, i do not know anything about private schooling and therefore none of what i am going to say applies to any form of private schooling from elementary through to the very last day of high school was absolutely horrible, i had no friends, i was constantly in between being backer acted, put on suicide watch and coming back to school two weeks later and doing jack s t at school, whether it would be because i lacked motivation, because the teachers were incompetent, i ammature, perverted, inconsiderate, irresponsible, ignorant, entitled grown a adults some were an exception or because i did not feel like i would amount to anything later in life or because my arthritis was acting up and my hands just could not write anymore or because insomnia or just because i was more concerned with making friends and not being alone in the world and in the end the only friends i made were the psychologist and psychiatrist that took my insurance and much more i amportantly my best friend who is like a brother to me now. i got to college and i was sti will an emotional kid but i was motivated to move forward with my education expecting college professors to be much better than the high school teacher whose life did not turn out the way they wanted and to say the least, the professors weren t much of an i amprovement, so i got mad, i felt cheated and i left to take a break from school, to regather myself so that i could pull through and get my degree and move on and then my funding was cut because i had dropped my last classes of that last term i went through and that is and percent my fault. i should not have let my emotions control my actions because at the end of the day i did what i needed to do to get to college and the degree is mine not theirs but i did not think of that then and what happened, happened and all i could do is move forward. so i got a job in order to save up money to get back to my education and i quit because i did not feel that i needed to be taken advantage of the way i was at work, i worked hours a week for dollars . hr as a part ti ame employee, i was offered a promotion as manager and i took it and training for the new position began and after a while i realized that i was just being used as a manager without manager pay, i had already been training a while and no word of my promotion was mentioned and when i asked i was met with, basically, who tf do you think you are? so i left looking for a better job because i know that i was worth more. i put up my two weeks notice and started looking for another job, that was almost a month ago, i have not found anything and i ended up not saving any money because i had to help my mom pay bi wills and i have my own responsibilities as well, such as my cat and my car and my phone and my food and hygiene and clothing, so on and so forth. now i am an unemployed, irresponsible, chilthish, completely dependent, college drop out with no one other than my mom to fully rely on. i have been applying to everywhere and now my mom has a new job with better benefits and better coworkers but she does not make a dollar more than i used too at my old job and we re just struggling to get f ing chicken tenders for dinner without sacrificing gas money or internet or rent or electricity or water. i am overwhelmed and sad and i did this to myself, i honestly did. everything that has lead me here was my own doing, that is how it feels and i know the obvious step forward is to get a job, my only problem is how i wi will get back to school. with what money? with what ti ame? i can not help thinking how stupid i have been.	severe
i finally got meds! i am so happy right now since i just got prescribed antidepressants. i know it is a really weird thing to be happy about being depressed enough to need them, but i sti will am. i also feel that i might get better since medication might help me. and i told my therapist i had lied thanks reddit but i didnt tell the truth, i just said i had lied. i did not specify about what. but i am sti will so happy right now, since after years of suffering i finally got medication! yes, this is a very weird post.	severe
stuck i talked to my therapist today and she says i need to want to get better . it is not like i do not want to but it feels like there is a voice in me that says i can not do it. that i have to have depression in order to survive. it even makes me think that i like it. because the outside world is scary. and i have had these sad feelings for so long it feels even comforting now. so how do i move forward and get better?	severe
when to admit myself ive been struggling with depression symptoms and self harm for my whole life, and ive never recieved any diagnosis or treatment because my parents dont take it seriously until i have major depressive episode once in a while, at which point they scramble to get me to see all kinda of doctors, psychs, etc. and sti will nothing happens because of wait lists and they forget about it when i eventually turn back to normal until the cycle repeats itself. i am currently in the middle of the cycle yet again. i got referred to a psychiatrist over a month ago and havent heard a word since. i also aged out of the free youth counselling i was going to. i am self harming and suicidal. is it wrong to admit myself to a psych ward so i can finally make some progress in this vicious circle?	severe
antidepressants make me act happy, but i feel so sad i take mg escitalopram and mg propranolol daily, i feel like i act happier and talk more but on the inside i am sti will like so sad, like when i talk i can hear myself saying how stupid i am and how i need to shut up but i can not. when i do not take them i just do not talk as much, and sti will feel as sad. anyone else feel like that?	severe
suicidal thoughts and self harm i have been on sickleave from work for almost two months now. my depression has changed alot since i first met my doctor. in the beginning my main issues were that i was tired and sad. i cried alot and i could not get out of bed on most days. now i have more energy and i do not cry as much, but i have way more anxiety, i am more sensetive to triggers, and i get panicattacks alot. i have managed to push everyone away from me so i have no one to talk to anymore, even when i try to reach out with something positive. even my sisters have stopped answering my calls. i feel incredibly lonely and i have alot of anger towards myself. i have started cutting my arms and legs and today i slapped myself and banged my head against the wall so hard that i got a bruise on my forehead. i also threw up two ti ames today because of a panicattack. i called the suicidehotline and that helped a little bit i guess. now i am lying in bed, trying to sleep, even though it is the middle of the day. i am worried that if i am awake i wi will just cause more harm to myself. the only reason i havn t ki willed myself yet is because of my cat. but it worries me that i have been considering giving my cat to my sister. i read in an article about how to see signs if someone is suicidal and one of the signs were that you give away objects that you like . my cat is not an object ofcourse, but it worries me because i want to give her away so i am free of responsibility and can just end my life without regrets. i love my cat so much. i love my sisters aswell, and i understand that they need to thistance themselves, but it just hurts. i feel like i have always been the person that everyone turns to for help, but now that i am in need of help everyone just ignores me. it hurts alot. but it also shows me my worth, so i guess i should not be that suprised.	severe
therapy does nothing for me and i am pushing everyone away i could not tell you how many therapists i have seen throughout my life. i have one now who is awesome who i have known for years. but for some reason, it is never worked. i leave feeling like i just wasted an hour of my life. someti ames i do not even want to go. i am on medication i have been on quite a few over the years and it does help especially my mania but i sti will struggle a lot with anxiety and occasionally depression. it makes me feel hopeless. is it true that there is treatment resistant depression? i feel like i have been pushing everyone out of my life. i never feel like talking to my family, and i ended up ruining my relationship with my best friend. and i do not even care about it anymore. what is wrong with me?	severe
need support, not doing well i have bipolar thisorder, anxiety thisorder, and chronic depression currently with no therapy or meds because i lost my health insurance usa . i am trying to get back on it and i know what i need to do, so i do not need advice on that. it wi will be a long process for a few reasons, but that is just what it is. i failed my bio test in college today. had to leave a bunch of stuff blank. have an expensive credit card bi will i am paying down from my car. working only part ti ame because of school. money is tight, my family life is not great, and i have been in a depression that nothing lifts. it is been like this my whole life. sad for no reason and i can not make myself happy. i feel pathetic and useless for not being motivated to study or do better. mental i willness has made college so hard for me. i am not failing but i am not doing great either. i am graduating soon and i feel so useless for not having a higher gpa like my peers. i need all the money i can get but when someone offered me a shift that starts nearly right after class at work, i said no. i have been asking for more scheduled hours but i feel so sluggish and sad. everyone at works tells me to leave that stuff and home and not to cry someti ames like i do. when i get sad i get yelled at. i want hours but i feel so drained and depressed today i could not force myself to do it. this is the most upsetting thing to me. i want to be finacially responsible. i feel so i ammature and lazy...	severe
growing up my therapist and i were talking about my relationship, and how my partner is kind of my security blanket. she said something along the lines of but he is his own entity, and you re your re own entity. you can be there for each other, but you have to be there for yourself. . she knows i did not have that growing up. nobody was ever there for me really so how the he wi will am i supposed to do it now? i guess we ll be working on that in the future. but after i got home and though about it for a bit i am thinking i do not want to. why should i have to take responsibility for myself, when i never asked to be born? i never wanted to be here. and knowing that society is asking me to be here and to cope with being mentally i will, and to do all this work i never signed up for is what is making me depressed i think. i would really rather die than do all this hard work that was just thrust upon me without my consent. i feel like no matter how much of this shit taht i sift through i wi will always feel the same about it. i just started taking wellbutrin a couple of weeks ago and idk if it is going to help me or not, but i certainly do not feel like therapy is very helpful because i do not want to do it. i do not want to do the work. i want to feel better, sure. but in the context i feel like it would be easier to escape, as i often do. into novels, into games, into my art. but reality sucks and i hate it and nothing anyone says or does is going to make that change and i just wish she would agree with me that life is indeed unfair and unjust and i should not have to be held to society is ridiculously high standars of what a person should be. i do not want to do stressfull things anymore. i just want to be happy. i just want someone to ask me what i need and take care of me for once.	severe
keep running away, keep running into dead ends then just running again life rant nsfw trigger warning pedophilia and suicide i apologize in advanced for grammatical mistakes and if this is ramblly, there alot on my mind and a weight on my chest. kind of ranting about life right now. past years have been terrible. life in general has been cruel. i am a f, going through a series of changes for the past month. we ll just get this life rant over with father an actual pedo,. not only did he perform, have me perform and try to have intercourse with his yr old daughter it is my earliest memory and went on continuously for at the very least yrs but he also took pictures of me, showed me child porn and had me talk dirty to hi am . also an alcoholic who cheated on my mother multiple ti ames, hid money from us in financial struggles, verbally abused my mother and at one point held a gun to her head as i watched and called the cops yrs old . mother knows about pedo father, literally said he never did any of that with me as if she were jealous, used me as a confident, verbally abused me, physically abused me threw me into walls, held me down and spit on my face, hit me where my nose would bleed, kick me in the head while i was on the groud , mostly when i tried to do anything a normal kid teen would do like go out with friends. sti will with my father today knowing what happened and everything he has done to our family . i went to the police when i was yrs old because i had physical hand mark is around my neck and they literally drove me home. younger brother four years younger. we fought like most siblings but we were there for each other no matter what. i would do anything for hi am and stand up for hi am when other kids bullied hi am. i wanted to adopt hi am and take hi am away form that house hold so he could have a better life then i. from all i know he received some physical abuse but not nearly as bad as i. he ki willed hi amself when he was yrs old more than a year ago months before i came home from the military. i miss hi am every friggin day. i feel as though i abandoned hi am when i joined the service when i was . outside family in there own little worlds. at one point each one of them has expressed their concerns with the household but none of them helped. none of them. but they can all talk gossip about it amongst themselves. my military service was short cut. due to alot of issues i ran into with drinking, tattoo policies, not able to form bonds with others, forming bonds with the wrong people, annd anxiety and depression being the end to it. got out as general under honorable condidtions. since getting out of the service in april i have had a total of jobs. not from being fired but not paying me, i was going to school and the hours would not work for me. finding a position in my desired field. and i have recently moved states, trying to get a fresh start. i move in with my bf m of yrs about a month ago. he has his own issues and someti ames we get on each other is nerves with our separate anxieties but we take care if each other. he makes me wake up with a smile even when everything sucks. he has been the kindest thing for me in these years of torment and change. present day last week bf had to take me to th er for chest pains that lasted for about an hour. they started to feel more and more suffocating. ik it was a panic attack. form whatvidk i was literally petting my cats. this new job job number has not been as ideal as i thought it would be. i have e months experience in my field and moved up fairly quickly compared to others i have alot to learn and this they know and i certainly do know. the first week and a half were hell. i feel as though i was thrown into it and given no direction. this caused me alot of anxiety from which i have made multiple si ample mistakes that i know better to make. i am a month into this job now and i am not feeling better. i have taken a step back asked a bunch of questions and have followed the other employees around to make myself feel more comfortable and learn more. i have gotten a lot of attitude from one girl who has already been corrected from our supervisor for it she does it when she is not around, and sup. is not around alot . she walks awaybor ignores me when i try to have a friendly conversation. when i ask how to do something she just says she wi will do it, then when i press about it she just ignores me or says she wi will do it in a different way. i generally am a smiley person i try to laugh and joke with everyone. most of the ti ame i am thisclcluded form conversations that i try to be apart of i listen to everyone talk say something, subject gets changes or ignored . my supervisor has talked to me twice about the anxiety caused mistakes and explained to her i am taking new anxiety meds to help i have been on diff anxiety meds that have either made sick to my stomach or made anxiety worse, now i am trying cbd . i have talked with the bf and even my mother who both say do the best i can. which i am. i am just am not comfortable with the environment and people i am with its alot slower than my last job and i clean about of the ti ame to make the day go by faster. i have pretty much made the decision that i dont want to work here anymore, it is literally keeping me up at night thinking about dealing with the next day and i am just miserable being there. i have not taken anyti ame down since leaving the military i have literally hoped form job to job and finished school. i just dont want to go on my th job within a year. i thought about confronting the girl and the other staff but against would cause issues, and maybe it is just me. i dont know what to do. i know what i want to do.... explain i think i need to take ti ame down with everything going on in my life rn, and say i wi will not be returning i am on a day probationary period so it wouldn t effect me so much take a week off then look for a job i can find them rather quickly due to military background and because i am a fucking hard worker no matter what i do .... but would it be the right thing to do. i apologize for the long post. i have gone to therapy and no one seems to understand the constant battle i have whether i want to live or die, o dont care. i am just trying to live my life and not let all the other bs that has happened win. i am sorry for such a long post. this is the first ti ame i have put all my crap out there. i just dont know what to do. i know i can not keep running away from the shit and that is why i am on the fence on whether or not to quit this job and take some actual ti ame off. i know i wi will be okay financially since i am good at saving money. i always adapt and over come. i am just also trying to do the right thing. again i am sorry for a long ramblly tmi post. i hope everyone on here finds there happiness and has a good mother fucking day ! thank you.	severe
i think my meds are not working anymore i got a starting level prescription for an ssri a couple months ago and i noticed it helping a lot pretty quickly. i stopped questioning why i should be alive and even started to enjoy life. i went back to school and was doing well, but it is slipping now and i do not know what to do. i do not want to be on medication in the first place never mind a stronger dose, but the intense waves of self thisgust, absolute loneliness, zero motivation, etc. hopefully you know that ones are back and i feel like i am slowing sinking back to where i was before. i am going to go tree planting in two months and it is known to be the insanely difficult mentally. i have told myself i am going to do it and it would be a huge let down to myself to back out before i even try, but i am absolutely terrified.	severe
fingers crossed for two weeks. knowing deep down inside that i am not a good person is torture and nothing can or wi will change me into being something at the very least, salvageable. i have flashbacks of past things i have done, ways that i have been treated and how i have reacted, and people i have surrounded myself with that have gotten me to this point. i cringe. i cringe deeply at those thoughts. i realize that i am the problem. i am the bad influence to those around me. even as a child, i was someone that normal kids with good parents should not have allowed their child to befriend. it is been years, and it just gets harder and harder to continue on. life is not easy and we all know that. my question is... how does a person go on living and trying to be happy when they know they are a thisappointment to everyone that is or feels obligated to be around them. living with the guilt and shame is unbearable. i am trying to convince my partner of years to apply for a position within his company that wi will be in the same city as his parents. i think i am making headway. i am going to ensure to tie up loose ends. a few days ago, proposed legislative changes were introduced to the current maid law medical assistance in dying in canada. i am holding onto the hope that on march , i wi will be able to at least start my application. it is been a long ti ame coming and i take comfort in the fact that this method wi will be fool proof. after a lifeti ame of attempts to get better through medication, therapy, activity, etc. i am take solace in the fact that i have tried and made it as long as i have have. i wi will not have a wake nor a funeral nor a celebration of life. i do not want my death printed in the paper or posted on social media. i do not want a burial plot nor a tombstone. no fanfare. no reminders. how do i go about ensuring i am thisposed of and forgotten quickly?	severe
i cut down on meds few weeks ago i have been seeing a psychiatrist for years. my mom and i often take a journey am in the morning by train of hours to go to another town where the main hospital is located. the doctor fixes the day for us to visit hi am. it causes alot of physical and mental harassment since the trains are very crowded in india. not only that, but we have to wait the entire day in line in the hospital just to see the psychiatrist. my mom never lets me stand in queue to get us registered for the appointments. instead she does it herself. you would not believe but the lines are always long and the amount of patients that the psychiatrist sees in a day is crazy maybe because it is a famous hospital around here . when i visited hi am, the psychiatrist prescribed me a anti depressant named, bupozen mg tablets. i have been eating this tablet religiously day and night like a stupid zombie for years. my parents have always forced me to take it daily thinking there is something wrong with me. they are not even aware that this tablet is a anti depressant. the doctor never tells us about it. just expects us to believe hi am and take the doses daily. i never skipped a day on the tablets thanks to my overly caring parents. it is very painful to take them though for it feels like i am some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them. all these years, i have doubted if they ever made me feel better but i think i have lost my ability to think after i started taking them. i just could not think after taking them. he also had some medication named gpam that he prescribed me early on when we first visited hi am in but later told me to stop taking it after few months. since then i have only been adviced to take the bupozen tablets. i googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when i asked hi am. later, i thiscovered they were anti depressants on the internet. i wonder if i am so mentally i will that that the doctor thinks i do not have to right to know about my medications that i am taking or does he fear that i wi will stop taking them after i get to know about them? many ti ames i tried asking hi am what this tablet was or what it did to me. he always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. but i never found any increased levels of concentration with it. instead i have avoided my studies all these years whether i took them or not. i strongly think that he lied. i even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist. once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental i willnesses. he told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after i took them to find my i willness. i did not agree to it because mental asylums in india look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. they do not even have proper beds for the patients. the place did not look so hygienic to me. moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me while you are admitted there to make sure you do not harm yourself or the others. they make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. all of this scared me and to be honest i saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. he was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. they did not show any empathy towards hi am. so, i made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that i have exams to give in college which i did have. he got angry with me but had to accept the excuse. now coming back to . few weeks ago, i fought with my mom over something and threatened her that i would stop taking the medications. she apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. i often threaten my parents when things do not go my way because they are over caring and make i willogical decisions regarding my life. my life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them. i think my condition has started getting worse after i cut down on the tablet. i only take it once now instead of twice a day. should i have not cut down on the anti depressants? i am very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. i cried few nights after i cut down on the meds because i was feeling worthless. i am getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that i used to do before i started taking the meds. i am very confused. did i take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor? what do you guys think i should do?	severe
my story and struggles i posted this in the bpd subreddit, but wanted to post it here as well. this is my story and i hope some might understand what i am going through and have gone through my entire life. thank you all so much for reading this. i have struggled with extreme mood swings, depression and ocd my entire life. i am just now learning about bpd and think that might be the root cause of course, i do not know and that would be for a medical professional to diagnose . when i was little, i would go through manic episodes of thinking i was possessed by demons. my parents put me in therapy and i guess that seemed to help. when i was or so, i developed an eating thisorder. i had a horribly abusive childhood and one of my parents took great joy in making me feel like less than a person. this parent, of course, hated themselves so they wanted me to hate myself as much as they hated themselves. they would project so much hatred onto me and make me feel so pathetic and low and even then i knew that that is just how they felt about themselves. it botched my self esteem beyond all hope at least that is how i felt . my eating thisorder was a way to control my life, that was seemingly out of control. when i got to college, i began to engage in very risky behavior. i drank to black out and found myself in many situations that could have ended very badly for me. i did all kinds of drugs without thinking anything of it. i would engage in very, very unstable relationships that would often isolate me from any other interactions other than my romantic partner . i always clung to men who had all the characteristics of my parent who abused me. i would thistance myself from friendships at random, convinced this person really hated me or was going to leave me at some point. i would go weeks, someti ames months without talking to anyone. i have a very hard ti ame grasping any sort of self identity...i do not even know if i can trust my own perception with myself. i do not feel like any of my perceptions are valid. i wi will go through days where my energy is off the charts, where i am happy and blissful and then at the drop of a hat i am back to so much depression. feeling void, sadness. emptiness. there are ti ames i do not even trust my own behavior, because i look back and past decisions and have to accept the fact that something with my mind was not right at the ti ame. this might be all over the place. but this is my truth. and i am ready to get help. thank you	severe
how to get over this guilt? i wi will try to make this short. i had to take an entire week off work. my co parent has bipolar, bpd and was having a manic episode and admitted hi amself to the mental hospital. he took our children every morning while i was working, and he worked nights always has so we never had to get childcare thankfully. inconveniently this week, our youngest son had a serious constipation issue and i, as a single mom had to run to multiple pharmacies and get the correct medicine, and do it myself. which is nearly i ampossible. what year old wants an enema, ya know?! i have anxiety and ptsd from my co parent overdosing a few years ago, and i had to give hi am cpr. he was bipolar manic at this ti ame. since this was happening again, it caused me extreme stress, anxiety and ptsd symptoms. i could not find a sitter without other people missing work or me paying someone. which i can not afford. i also can tell my older boy is wondering where his dad is, so i felt staying home to be there only parent currently, that it was better for us as a family. not to mention my anxiety, my sons constipation, etc. i tried to explain this to my boss and the first ti ame he understood and said if i needed anything to tell hi am. then, when i told hi am i need the rest of the week off to deal with this plus my son being sick, he said i need to be able to rely on you a little bit. but do what you got to do and we ll talk and figure it out monday. i could tell he was not happy. i feel guilty. this job has been good to me but what i am dealing with is beyond their comprehension, because i can not explain without bursting into tears and having a panic attack. he does not understand that all of my coworkers would be asking questions and i just did not want to talk about it, so staying home to collect myself and wait it out to see if the mental hospital helps my co parent so he can see and i can trust hi am with his boys again every morning. should i write my boss an email explaining it? i am sure we ll talk monday but i do not want hi am thinking i am not a good employee. i try my best and really enjoy my job, this situation is just very hard for me. i am having heart palpitations, the shakes, mood swings and depression now dealing with all of this. can anyone help me? i am embarrassed to talk to this with my friends they do not seem to fully understand since they do not have mental i willness. thank you.	severe

i am an addict a little bit of context, i, year old male, suffer from generalized anxiety and depression for many years. i have been diagnosed at the beginning of the year. today, it is been months since i stop working and in the last year i lost a lot of friends due to my isolation. in the past years, i played on console or pc everyday. if i was not on my pc, i was on my ipad watching youtube or twitch for hours.i would always structure my life around gaming and watching watching youtube. if my friends were asking me if i want to go out with them, i would always think wi will i have the ti ame to play if i go out? . you can understand that every estival ti ame of the year was tough for me. every ti ame that i had those thoughts, i would judge myself, but i kept the same thought process. in mid january, i decide to cut gaming from my life and it is been hard, very hard. since then, there is not one day that i do not think about play again. after i stopped playing video games, i was always on my ipad watching twitch and youtube so i asked my mother to hide it so i can do something other than nothing. because yes, i was doing nothing, i could not even remember what video i looked hour ago. now that i cut every unhealthy habit from my life, everything should be good and i could begin to live a real life you would think and so do i. lol i have a phone. yes the little thing that you always have on you. yes, that little piece of shit just took the place of my old addiction without me noticing it. i started to play mobile games, which i always hated, and been on reddit a lot. when i mean a lot, it is a lot more that you could think of. yesterday was a pretty sad day and just before trying to go to sleep, i saw the worst nightmare of my life. the reality. you have a feature on iphone that can give you your screen ti ame. since the beginning of the week, days, i have been on my phone for hours. ing hours, it is more than the half of the ti ame of my week and this screen ti ame does not count the ti ame i watch tv. i had a panic attack and deleted every game on my phone. so now i am stuck inside of my house with nothing to do because i am too anxious to try something new. welcome in my infinite circle. just to reassure you guys, i see a therapist at the moment and i hope to get better. thank you for reading me and i wish you a beautiful day tldr i found that for the last years, the only things i did was gaming and watching youtube twitch reddit and i did not have any passion.	severe

depression i have been fighting depression for over years. i am a vietnam veteran but was depressed before my service. i got drafted when i was years old. the war did not help but added to my condition. i fight everyday for my life and keep going. i found exercise helps but they are sti will ti ames i wonder what the hell is life about. i ride a bike, use my bow flex and walk. i know how you feel and everyone one else. i found counseling not helpful for me. i found that prescription drugs were not a help for me. i became a drug addict one ti ame in my life and got shot in the head leaving me for dead. there are no magic bullets. i find a peace in everyone is posting. it is a brotherhood of souls that are sharing. the last ti ame i felt that was in south vietnam in the s. this group has been more of a help knowing i am not alone. i think everyone is different in their treatment. someti ames , i just laugh it off by watching funny movies or listening to jokes. i became a prankster and found peace doing that. instead of fighting it every ti ame i made it my friend. i know, i wi will never get rid of it but at least i can keep it close to me. there is an old saying keep your friends close but your enemies closer. peace be with all, tony	severe

i hate the fact that my anti depressants make me feel, well, not depressed. so back in august i finally had the guts to talk to my doctor about me possibly being depressed due to survivor is guilt i got after i beat cancer. i got prescribed anti depressants and was on the for a few months. after my prescription ran out i decided not to get it renewed because i did not like the fact that i needed them to not be depressed. flash forward to last week i went to my doctor for an unrelated reason and she asked me how i was doing, and i told her i was eh. she told me she had noticed that i did not get my refi will after months and if i wanted to go on them again. using my better judgement i decided to start taking them again and that was that. fast forward to about days later and when i went to greet my wife when she got home from work i felt totally different. i asked her if i seemed happier and she told me it was probably the antidepressants. then it hit me that yeah it does make a huge difference, at least for me. and i hate it. i like not being depressed. i like being able to focus on things i like. i like that i do not need to sit at my desk playing games for extended periods of ti ame. i have an addictive personality so when i get into something i go into it hard and this ti ame it was an mmo. for the past few days i have found myself not playing every chance i got and instead pacing myself until i felt satisfied for the session. i have found more motivation at work and i am not slogging through the days. i am not stressing about money, which usually led to me having panic attacks but as i am writing this it is not even phasing me. hell, even my libido has been going crazy this past week. everything feels like it is better than it was weeks ago. and it is because of this damn pi will. i wi will keep taking it because i know it is for my own good because i have experienced the difference. my doctor does not want me on them permanently for now, so i know there is hope i wi will be ok in the future. but for now it sucks to know that the only way to fix the way i am feeling is through medication.	severe
lexapro tolerance. good eve, llamas. would love to know if there is a possibility to building i ammunity to ssri medication. i used to have horrid panic attacks and anxiety, all day, every day. was put on mg of escitalopram, eventually bumped to mg, and have been there for about years. maybe . it completely stopped my anxiety. even i could not believe it. but. my anxiety has since returned. and it is becoming just as bad as it once was, before i started lexapro. so, i plan to speak to my doctor in the coming week and all, but just for my morbid curiosity, has anyone had a tolerance build up to their ssri? any advice or information is warranted.	severe

nothing has ever worked for my depression i wi will try to keep this fairly succinct. i have suffered from major depression for . years now am currently male . it came absolutely out of nowhere and i have never been able to figure out what the cause of it is. for all intents and purposes i was having a good life great social circle, good relationship with family, doing well in school, physically healthy, etc. but for whatever reason one morning i went to class feeling like absolute dogshit. all of the symptoms you can think of, i got hopelessness, anhedonia, low sex drive, weight fluctuation, suicidal ideation, etc. after about or months of these feelings persisting with barely any days where i felt happy and normal, i decided to spi will the beans and tell family and friends. it went okay, but my mom was initially very skeptical about the whole thing though she eventually came around and my best friends were supportive, though many acquaintances stopped talking to me. in december of i finally decided to seek therapy. it went fairly well, as my therapist was a very kind person, and after about months she finally convinced me to take ssris. i was on them for just over a year and they barely made a dent. felt more emotionless than normal, but it was an i amprovement. i then decided to try a variety of other things as therapy meds weren t giving me the results that everyone clai amed they would deliver. i read a huge page long self help book on cbt. i started doing mindfulness meditation. after grad school i started eating healthier and exercising more. but none of it really did anything long term, just temporary boosts to my overall feeling. i got so desperate looking for more solutions that i actually ended up doing magic mushrooms just the other day it was a mostly extremely pleasant experience but hours later, the dark thoughts about suicide returned, so not even shrooms gave me the magic cure that helped for so many people. the more i try to alleviate this thing, the more demoralized i become. all these years trying to i amprove myself and i feel like for every ton of effort i give, i only receive an ounce of results in return. it is getting so exhausting and i si amply do not know what to do next. nothing about the future gives me any hope or anticipation a new career, a family, a new gf, none of these life goals really make me feel much of anything. all that gives me comfort is sleep, food, music, seeing my brothers every now and then that is it. i do not know how relateable this specific story is. i just needed to vent somewhere using a throwaway account. at this point in another . years i seriously can not i amagine myself making any more progress when it comes to this i willness. every passing year i become more convinced that this condition is unequivocally permanent and untreatable. anyway, thanks for reading. i hope you have a better day than i wi will.	severe

another bout of depression, feeling trapped in life life went downhi will since . was depressed from the pressure to do well in school and attend a good university. severely suicidal in my senior year of uni. now that all these have finally passed parents sti will pestered me about grad school amp working abroad , there comes the insurmountable challenge of having to work at different jobs that would make me depressed. i am fortunate to grow up not having much financial troubles. i am really privileged. my source of depression is mostly from the expectations that people have for me. it is easy to say that just do yourself and ignore what others say . but it is another thing to grow up worrying that your family would love you less because you did badly on a test. my second job is depressing. i try to not think and feel as much during the work days. but the fact that i have to work over weekends with no ot compensation, at the equivalent of dollars k per year in my country is currency, depresses me a lot. i can not see a future even when i put in so much effort every day. someti ames i just want to die off during my long commute to work. it is saturday night and i have not started working on the file that i have to deal with. i spent half a day sleeping in, too tired to do anything else. i wanted to pick up violin again used to play in school orchestra . i listed getting a drawing tablet as my wish for this year because i wanted to go back to drawing again. in reality, i am swept off by the currents of life, pushed in different directions and yet headed no closer to the destination that i want to be at.	severe
is there a medication that let us you enjoy things? viibryd just cut off all my negative emotions. i spent all day getting things done and i went to sleep as soon as i finished. the problem was that it made me reckless. i did not care about anything and i could not feel fear or anxiety so i would walk into traffic and run red lights and stop signs without a second thought. i sti will wanted to die so it was not a big deal until i nearly totalled my car. i could not afford the repairs so my parents had to pay for it. next i tried mirtazapine, but it did absolutely nothing. has anyone found a medication that let them enjoy things instead suppressing their emotions?	severe
first two days on wellbutrin hi guys, i was prescribed wellbutrin a few days ago, and yesterday was my first day on the medication. i was not really sure what to expect, but i was under the i ampression that it would take at least a week or two before i started feeling a noticeable i amprovement. however, in the first day alone, my energy levels skyrocketed and i feel like i have been flying through life. i took the first pi will at am after being unable to sleep the night before, and soon after fell asleep from like am pm in an extended nap not good for me, i know i know . then, i woke up, and i could already feel a significan not difference in my mood. i went to a lan tournament for video games last night, and the whole ti ame i just felt like i was buzzing. i had perfect focus, i was laughing and joking the whole ti ame, and i just felt like, wow, is this how people are supposed to feel? after getting home from the tournament at about am, i fell asleep on the couch and woke up around am sti will feeling fully energized. i once more took my pi wills at this morning, and am now about to go to work for a staff meeting, something that i usually would be dreading but right now i am sti will buzzing around feeling awesome. i feel like i could do anything i wanted, with activities that would normally feel like work seeming no worse than how i would spend my free ti ame, and activities that i usually like to participate in with my small supply of depressed energy seem like the most exciting thing in the world. i literally feel like i could be jumping for joy at the thought of going to work out, or hang out with my friends, or painting some d amp d miniatures, or even just playing some video games. i do not know if this is normal, or if this effect could just be some kind of weird placebo, but has anyone else felt like this on wellbutrin? should i actually be concerned? i do not think i have ever felt this happy and motivated in my entire life.	severe
can somebody help me? i feel like such an asshole whenever i refer to my moods as depressive episodes because i am not clinically diagnosed of having depression. basically what happens during these ti ames is one moment i feel alright happy, even and then i see or remember or think of something that makes everything crash. my whole chest feels like a huge weight had just been dropped on it. usually when this happens, i go off on my own and just stare at whatever is in front of me, my head completely blank. if i get tired of doing that, i go to sleep. if i am in a party or just hanging out with my friends, i just go home out of the blue and sleep. i do not feel like talking to anyone, and i delete all my social media apps so no one can reach me. i also thisappear as my friends like to call it and do not show up to hang out with them until i have to go to school. if i do hang out with them at their house, i am either on my phone or sleeping. if one of them talks to me, i pretend i am asleep so they would leave me alone. every month there is at least a week where i feel this shitty. it typically lasts for about a week or so, and during this period, i think of ways i can ki will myself. during the worst episodes , i actually wrote letters to the people i amportant to me because was convinced i would go through with it. i have got about three notes now. the last ti ame, i even ordered two bottles of sleeping pi wills online. i never do go through with it because i am too anxious it wi will be all over the news in my hometown, and because i do not want to be a burden to the one who finds me. i am writing this because it started up again tonight, and i am sick of not knowing whether i have a serious problem or if it is all just in my head. could this be depression, or am i just overreacting? thank you! p.s. my parents would not allow me to go to a psychologist because it wi will ruin our family is reputation, and i do not have money of my own to seek for professional help, so i do not have a way of really knowing. i know this is not the place to find it, but i just need someone to tell me their opinion on whether or not i could be suffering from depression. 	severe
my first post hello. i do not know where to start... this is my first ti ame writing and saying these things outloud. i am severely deppresed and i keep hiding it. i just finished talking to my mom, telling her how deppresed i am and all she kept saying was that she is deppresed as well and i am a thisappointment to her. by now, i completely isolated myself from everyone and i have this happy personality i put on when i am with people. my husband does not know and i fear he would not understand. i think i have other thisorders as well and all in all i have been feeling really down and weak... i hope everyone that feels like me finds their happiness and rainbow after rain.	severe
i have a problem reacting proportionally to things. i was diagnosed with severe depression around years ago. i went to therapy for years almost and i thought i was okay. my therapist was leaving anyways, and i felt that was a good opportunity for me to break away from, what i felt was, the crutch of cognative behavioral therapy. i felt good for years, and then school stress started getting to me. then i got into a relationship, and this became one of the biggest catalyst for my depression coming back. it is my first relationship, some things were expected by the other who was more experienced than i was. it was generally a mess, a mess i hope i have under control now. but right now i have a severe problem with reaction i ampact. every little thing makes me spiral back down to thinking the worst. or feeling the worst. at the moment i am feeling so shitty just because i was downvoted to heck for literally no reason, and when i tried to express my confusion that was also downvoted. this is so stupid to say, but i do not understand people is cruelty. i get it, it is just some stupid electronic numbers, who cares. but i sti will do, and i sti will do not know what i did wrong for people to go to the lengths of thinking i do not like you, or what you said so i wi will downvote this comment and all your other ones because of it . on a post where it literally said do not be afraid to ask questions, no question is si willy . i feel somehow so betrayed by that. i think i am not going to post again in that community again... i never saw anybody else treated that way, so i rationalize that i did something wrong and i feel so guilty. yet so stupid for feeling that. sorry for the ramble, it is just really difficult right now to be coherent.	severe
mirtazapine has anyone had any experience with mirtazapine? if so, what is it like and can you let me know the benefits and side effects of the drug? i am currently taking mg vyvanse daily, i struggle to sleep and i get quite bad anxiety especially on the crash so i was prescribed this to take every night, wi will this be effective? also, does anyone take mirtazapine alongside with an adhd sti amulant like vyvanse or addys? is it a safe mix more so, is it safe if i regularly smoke weed drink? 	severe

i do not want to die, i am just exhausted. recently i have been put into partial hospitalization because of suicidal thoughts. i do not mind if there, but it does not really help with suicidal thoughts. i think about dying and i feel a great sense of relief, until i realize i am sti will here and the process of suicide is really hard. i feel like i am not meant for this life and my only option is suicide. my biggest fear is seeing my th birthday, and i think that is sad, but my urge to ki will myself is far greater than my feelings. i am terrified honestly.	severe
depression and telling teacher i self harm sooo, you read the title. i have felt depressed for a year and the only person who knows is my english teacher. he is extremely nice and supportive about it and lets me go to hi am whenever, i can just leave a class to go to hi am. about months ago, i started self harming. i know it is bad and i should get help before it gets worse. i know he wi will be nice about it but the school wi will have to tell my dad and my dad does not even know i feel down, let alone self harm. i just feel so depressed at the moment. also my friend keeps joking about me self harming and says stuff out loud for everyone to hear and it is unconfortable. i am also a dancer and do so many sports. also its summer soon and it is visible. also i wear a skirt to school with no tights so it is very risky, wearing a skort in pe is also uncomfortable. with gcses around the corner aswell it wi will get stressful. is it worth telling hi am as he is really really nice, can get me help, stop the girl from exposing me etc... but my dad wi will have to know.	severe
told my parents and it is only gone downhi will from there before i start, i am not saying you should not tell anyone. it can really help, but in my situation, with my parents i knew it would end this way. i am sti will glad that i am starting therapy so please do not use this post as an excuse to keep your feelings bottled up. i am and i have had depression for at least years now and it is been really serious. i tried to commit suicide mid last year, sti will feeling just as shitty now as well. along with my attempt i managed to fail of my classes and year all together. honestly it is gotten so bad that i can not get myself to do anything at all, i have dropped out of school because i was not going there in the first place, and all i do now is stare at walls all day. i was never planning on telling my parents. i was thinking of ways i might be able to get a therapist or something without them knowing what i have been through... but as the title suggests, that is not how it turned out. one day i just got a random boost in confidence that lasted a day and a half, coming down from that made me feel absolutely terrible. one because it reminded me of how terrible i feel . of the ti ame, and two because during that high i spoke to my mum about this. ever since i told my mum i do not feel comfortable around her. i mean i never felt to comfortable around my mum in the first place but it is just gotten worse and worse. the way she talks and acts makes me feel so shitty. and what is even worse is she got me to drop out of school. this pissed of my dad, which then put me in a situation where my mum made me tell my dad, and now i do not feel safe at either house. my mum makes me feel like i am very useless with her tone being really soft all of a sudden. and my dad constantly has this tone in his voice and the way he acts towards me suggests that i think of myself as some sort of hero or victi am in my story and that i need to just grow up and just act like nothings happening. this could not be further from the truth because i am aware that despite the fact i can not control it, i am sti will responsible for anything i do in this state and just because i have serious depression does not mean it is not my fault i dropped out of school, and hobbies, or how i ghosted all my friends, i know that i am sti will a stubborn piece of sh t and that despite hating myself more than anything i manage to sti will have a huge ego. but what i want hi am to know is that it works the other way around too, just because i am responsible for these does not mean that i am in control or that i have the physical capability of just changing in the snap of a finger, i want hi am to know that my is not the same as his and that he should not expect me to live up to these expectations just because he managed to.	severe
struggling really badly hey all, my life is going okay, but i struggle with near constant pain that makes me homebound. i also work from home, but i have been able to do a lot of projects to feed into my creativity and to make a good living without leaving the house, which is, of course, quite helpful. i have struggled with depression on and off my whole life, though it was really bad in my teens. now i am in my mid s and my depression has just skyrocketed. i have a job. i have a great partner of nearly years. i have a family. and sti will, i am so depressed. i find it hard to complete some of my work so i can continue to earn my income, so that suffers when i am depressed as well. i am okay for a while, then i get into these moods where i literally want to die and start crying about how i do not understand why i am alive and think i am crazy. i should also mention i have had a group of online stalkers for a while now. they do not necessarily interfere with my life anymore, but there is one woman who makes broadcasts about my life nearly daily. it is not anything grounded in reality, just her saying she thinks i have failed at my career when she says she does not actually know what ido , saying i am probably miserable in my relationship and then admits she has no reason to say that, she is just an empath and knows , etc. i do look at it, for whatever reason. when i mentioned this gets me down to people, they always say, do not look at it. or you know your feelings of being upset about this are valid because she is been doing this for so long, so why do you even mentioned it anymore? i posted about it on a message board and i had to turn it off because i specifically said i do not want to be told to get over it because if i could, i would have already done that. but like people were like, i know you do not want to hear this, but get over it. like...wow thanks. never thought of that before. i hope this makes sense. my brain is so clouded and it is a struggle to function. not sure i wi will get my work done to day because i am struggling.	severe
diagnosis yesterday i was diagnosed with major depression, ptsd, and paranoid delusions... great. now i am more depressed.	severe
i was hoping it was just an episode but i am back into depression. i have been diagnosed with depression and other mental i willness or mental i willness related problems as anxiety, ptsd from abuse etc over four years and half ago. it is relatively a short amount of ti ame but it was really bad. it got better after the first two years, then it was not continuative but i would only get medium to long depressive episode. all the episodes were really bad and intense. the last year i had relatively few and short episodes even tho my anxiety was bad so i hoped for an i amprovement but starting from june , it progressively got worse. in september i started having what i thought was just another bad episode. after some months i began to realize it was not just an episode and i connected the dots. what i was having for all last year weren t separate episodes. i am back into depression. i am not self diagnosing. i talked to my therapist about it. it is having a really bad influence on my academic and social life not that my social life was that good before and i can not bring myself to explain to the people around me what is going on. it sucks. it really sucks.	severe
my therapist texted me hours before appointment to cancel i was really looking forward to the appointment. it would be the second one with this therapist, and things seemed different. she said she was fine with using no cbt or emdr over the phone before my first appointment since i was not a big fan. i have ptsd, sure, but what i really wanted help with was my depression and social issues. i provided her with information a couple of weeks after my first appointment and a few weeks before the second. she texted me three hours before the appointment to let me know that unless i planned on using emdr, i could not continue sessions with her. because i did not want emdr, she canceled. i am devastated. i thought things would work out this ti ame. i thought i would finally receive help. i am tired of having trouble finding a good therapist and tired of having to recount the same things with a new therapist each ti ame only for it to go nowhere.	severe
you know you have no hope left when even the suicide hotline hangs up on you. this actually happened and i am not making it up. i remember being suicidal since i was years old though i do not remember what it was for . i have been trying recently to just get through everyday day by day although it is hard because a part of me sti will wanted to live. i started getting suicidal thoughts once again and rang up the suicide hotline since it was am and i could not reach out to anyone else not that there is someone though thinking that someone could help me at least momentarily. i started telling the lady who picked up about the thoughts and how long i have been having them. i told her i have been having those thoughts for years now because it has been a lot in the last three years. then as soon as i tell her that, she cuts the call and let us me be by myself. was she telling me to deal with it myself and that i have no hope and i actually am a burden on the world?	severe

i am stuck on my own until i become an adult i am but i have had depression for as long as i can remember. i do not trust my parents because of the way they were abusive in the past, and when i reached out to psychiatrists i was abused by them for years until i was able to fake getting better so i could get away. they do not let me have any say in treatment because of my age and i was constantly forced to do things which felt worse. they hurt my physical development with forced drugs and i was locked up for months because my psychiatrist lied and said i was about to ki will myself, which was not even physically possible for me. i do not have friends at school so being in school and hearing other children being so happy makes me feel sick. i hate how they are always laughing and talking in groups. i have a friend but he lives so far away and i have no hope of seeing hi am until i am an adult. being at school tears my memory apart and the noise and extreme loneliness makes me forget i have a friend at all, which makes everything feel worse. i do not have any trusted adults around here. my guidance counselor said i have a thisorder and told me i need to change my personality. i can not take a break from school because it is i willegal and in the past i was locked up for missing school due to being depressed, but going to school is wrecking my memory of positive things. i do not mind being on my own in my house but being alone while everyone else is having friends makes me feel like i amploding. whenever i talk to other children i find that we have nothing in common and they do not make an effort to listen to me. i do not know if i can keep going for another two years. i am always being pressured to sort out my plans for a career and to make preparations for university but i have no career ambitions and i am too tired to work on anything. i wish i got a chance to live like all the other students but i was bullied since i was and never even got to start feeling happy. i just want the constant pain to go away. i do not know how to get better because all the resources are for adults or children with supportive adults. i take care of myself but it does not get better. i do not understand why it would not get better because everyone says you ll feel better if you eat well and do hobbies and such. i am stuck and i can not find any way out of the pain.	severe

i am in a horrible predicament. i need advice. so about a month ago i finally got help from my school therapist which i am very thankful to have . she recommended me to go to some treatment facilities to make appointments with an out of school therapist so i can have access to one outside of school. she recommended this because many kids use the school therapist and we do not always get a lot of ti ame for our sessions because they eat into my class ti ame. this make me so happy because my old therapist quit on me and i finally felt like i was going to get the help i wanted, but everything went to shit. they have to make an appointment with my mother because i am a minor before they can see me by myself. my mother is terribly i will because of her baby, and wi will be i will until the baby is born in about a month. and even after the baby is born, she would not have ti ame to go to the appointment because she is going to have to deal with a newborn. i feel like shit. i am not going to be able to get appointments outside of school for months and i do not know if i can wait that long. it feels like i am the only one trying to help myself get better. i am so close to just giving up.	severe

loosing interest in stuff i developed depression almost exactly three years ago and it has i ampacted my interest in plenty of things. for one, i used to be a bookworm, now i can not even finish a short story. the only thing that i keep enjoying was drawing. but in the past four months i have barely drawn anything, i decided to sit down and draw something a few days ago just for the sake of it and i realized how much ski will i have lost in such a short period of ti ame. i feel so uninspired, my drawings look boring and i am not interested in finishing them. i am not sure if i should push myself to doodle or draw atleast something everyday or if i should just let it be so i dont get even more frustrated. its just so sad that my depression is kinda taking everything away from me and i am not entirely sure what to do. idk i am trying to be more productive, i started a bullet journal recently to stay on track with everything but i oftenly just dont feel like doing anything. i think if not for my eating thisorder, i probably would not leave my bed to go excercise.	severe

getting diagnosed if this belongs in a different sub please let me know! sti will new to reddit i have felt like i have been depressed for the past few years, and i turned around months ago so now that i have medical confidentiality, i would like to start getting professional help. theres a lot of issues though. i have tried asking for help from my parents to get a diagnoses but they shut it down and refuse to take me to the doctor s. i would like to schedule an appointment to get a professional is opinion and start a road to recovery but i am unsure how to do that. i am dependent on my parents medical insurance tricare so i am nervous they might be able to tell i have booked a doctor is appointment under their insurance or if i get medication, they wi will be able to somehow know. i also can not drive, so getting to a hospital is going to be tricky but i can probably get a friend to drive me or i can take public transport. i am unsure as to how all the medical insurance issues would play out and if i were to start taking meds, how i would hide it and get refi wills without my parents finding out. if someone who knows about this kind of stuff can help point me in the right direction that would be great! also if i were to get diagnosed, how would it look from then on? do i have to do therapy because as much as i would like to, i can in no way reliably get to a therapist due to my transportation reliance on my parents.	severe

my next therapy session is not until three more weeks, so... ... i thought this was the next best place to talk about my recurring depression. thing had been going well for some ti ame after my latest depressive episode. i even met a great guy last year who really gave me new hopes and dreams for the future. well, long story short, i felt an episode coming on during mid january and when me and the guy broke it off some weeks ago, shit just went downhi will fast. i cried all the ti ame, and fell back on my unhealthy coping mechanisms. i know a break up can feel like the end of the world, but i really reached a point where i just wanted to give up completely. like, what is even the point of trying to be happy when you re just going to feel like dying again and again. if life is just going to be like this, then i would rather just die. i feel like i am just... living. he made me feel alive and like life could be something i had not even considered, while sti will getting everything i have dreamed of. i have not felt such an intense connection to someone in a long ti ame, and it is hard to get over it. i sti will want to text hi am everyday and just ask how he is, if he is alright. i know he is struggling with things too, but i am afraid i wi will worsen my mental health if i do. i keep thinking i am getting better everyday, but here i am, writing this post. anyway, i am not particularly looking for advice, just needed a place to rant about my situation. thanks for reading.	severe

i just do not want to keep living like this. i feel like i have been battling depression since my childhood. i am not close with my family nor with my siblings. there is always fights going on in my family all the ti ame. this made a huge i ampact on my behaviour, i became short tempered and cranky. i do not want to be like this but they are always making me shout at everything. i have not had much of anybody to share anything all my life. i never had any friend i could like talk to about everything. i never liked the idea of friends cause i never could trust them. all my life since childhood i saw a dream that at a ti ame there would come this significan not other and she is going to fix my whole life and be that everything for me. i always kept waiting, always kept hoping. almost a year and half ago i thought i had actually found that significan not other. oh i was so sure i had found her. i found my peace in her and just talking to her, being with her started to change everything. i loved her, i really did. but she has family issues as well, as soon as her family suspected something her life in her house went unbearable. at first, i was the one who was not ready to let her go through everything for me and i asked her to leave me. but then i could not be like this alone i told her that please we ll just figure something out, we can. but apparently she already made up her mind. its been . years she left and my life has become more miserable than ever. i can not sleep at night because i have void dreams and for that i wake up in the middle of the night all panting and crying. things in the family has escalated even more, there is almost fights in every hour. i have some very i amportant exams coming up in a month and i can not even study shit. my mental state is just fucked up, my physical health is fucked up, my study life is fucked up, everything is fucked up. i just do not freaking know what to do. i want to give up my life but i can not find the courage to do that. i just do not want to keep living like this.	severe

first day taking venlafaxine so my doctor has switched me after much persuasion on my part to this antidepressant. i am started on mg ir two ti ames a day, as well as mg propranolol ti ames a day. i tried my first dose of the venlafaxine this morning and holy hell, it was like torture. initially it felt like i had taken amphetamines, then came the extreme nausea, the shaking, dizziness, extreme anxiety, i had to take the day off work as i could barely even stand up without puking or getting extremely thisoriented. i guess the propranolol was to help with some of that but my doctor did not really explain much to me, and i was cautious to use the propranolol as i have had a pretty severe reaction to it in the past when i was on sertraline, so i did not take any this ti ame. the propranolol caused my bp and heart rate to plummet, and i could not even stand up without losing consciousness. so i am pretty reluctant to take it again. i am not sure what i am trying to get at with the post but i am very alone right now and i guess i am looking for reassurance that i should power through this. i have used and abused and ton of drugs over the years but this basically felt like torture by far the worst experience of my life. i am terrified of taking a second dose and going through all that again, especially with the thought that it can take up to two weeks for the side effects to settle down.	severe

too broken to change what matters i am depressed, suicidal, lonely. general anxiety as well as social anxiety. come from an abusive background, many things happened along the way and i grew smaller and smaller inside. i would love to have friends to hang out with. i would love nothing more than to love, feel loved and be loved. to feel comfortable in my skin. to feel safe. confident. opti amistic. happy. but to change all those things i would have to do things that are i ampossible for me. i do not know how to approach people, especially not a girl i might like. i would not even know how to hold her hand or hug er, or anything closer than that. i am scared of pretty much everything, do not believe in myself, hate myself more than anyone else. it started over years ago so i do not think it wi will change either. i wish i had the guts to end it and that my family would not be hurt by it. its very late, sorry for the ramble. it just sucks to want something that you are just not capable of. i honestly can not go much longer. therapy, meds, all that shit help being productive but not helping me fix those things at their core. i am just not ok	severe
today i opened up to my friends and it was a mistake. a little back story on me, like most everyone i do not talk about my feelings to anyone and i hold in a lot of stuff because i do not want to bother anyone and i would rather help others before myself. i some what recently got prescribed medication for it and it is helped but each ti ame a few months after i have had to up the dosage multiple ti ames because they just stop working. recently it is happened again i need to be put on something again because i have been feeling like i am back at square one. today while my friends and i were all hanging out one them asked me if i was feeling ok because he noticed something was off and i told hi am not really my medication has stopped working . my friend who makes it known that he is depressed asked me what i am taking and i told hi am antidepressants he then proceeds to tell me what i have never seen you depressed, you re not depressed i am depressed . he always seems to bring hi am being depressed up anyti ame he can and justifies his shitty actions because he is depressed . it really just made me feel like shit because i tried opening up to people i thought i could trust and it just solidified my choice of just not opening up to just anyone. i am just going to stick to hiding it.	severe

d. a. f. depressed as fuck. i have been diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety. been on different medications since high school. my wife is going to be getting a new job. i should be happy for her. i am absolutely terrified. she is going to be the only woman in her department. guys wi will be working closely with her the entire work day. i know there is cheating in her new line of work. married or not, it happens. happy marriages have been shattered, because of the cheating that goes on. she loves the job. she is not going in to it for that reason. i figure that it is just a matter of ti ame before she finds someone else, someone much better. better than i wi will ever be. relationship wi will form. after being with her for minutes, it is really easy to see how beautiful and amazing she is. it is easy to fall in love with her. she deserves better. someone that does not have to take pi wills to go through the day. why would she want to be with a mental guy. my job is pretty hazardous. lately, i have been doing risky things in hopes i go away. hoping something bad wi will happen to me. i wi will often day dream of hanging myself. the hurt is too much to take lately. the nights seem to hurt more. i wake up wondering if today is a good day to die. how do i tell her my worst nightmare could happen? she does not understand my depression. do i just walk away so she does not have to be with a guy like me.	severe

it sucks when you try to get help and it blows up on you last year, i saw a therapist for about months through my university and it went well. i began this school year hoping that i wouldn t need therapy, but i became more depressed than ever and decided that i have to go through it again. this ti ame around finding a therapist to talk to ended up becoming a shit show. i was told by the people working at student insurance that i would get a grant that would cover my school health insurance so that i could see someone weekly. i signed up for it only to find that i would not be getting the grant due to some system errors on their part. on top of that, the school insurance for some reason did not cover my two visits with the new therapist i was seeing. that is an extra k in loans for me. i would not be able to see someone until the end of march and i would not be able to see this person very often. until then, i guess i amma just have to keep being depressed. i guess what i am trying to say is that even if you wanted to get help with your depression or other mental health issues, it is fucking hard to get that. insurance sucks, getting help is expensive, and it is hard to find someone to see regularly. you would not be taken seriously for depression unless you call a hotline and tell them you re suicidal. i realize now that a reason why some people is depressed because it is hard to get actual help.	severe

i am tried of coming here and writing this again and again i am exhausted not being able to do anything. no matter how much i try, the littlest inconvenience breaks me. i am not able to function like a normal human being. plus, all my relations have crumbled or at least feel like they are or wi will very soon. my parents are extremely lonely and depressed and they pour that on me. my mom keeps mocking me by calling me depression girl and my father refuses to acknowledge i have depression inspite of knowing i had attempted suicide a few years ago. i do talk to a therapist but it is not working too well because i know i would not heal as long as i live in this environment. i also got scammed by a few psychiatrists and i can not afford meds. i am sick of seeking professional help because it honestly has not made me feel any better. my best friends also lack empathy or are too ignorant about my mental health. i tell my boyfriend that i have anxiety and it makes hi am more anxious so i have been asked by my friends and boyfriend to not have anxiety so that they can stop having anxiety because of me. and it is not like my boyfriend or my close friends are shitty.... i know not all can cope up with mental i willness nor is my mental i willness their responsibility. but like i said, i have seeked professional help and it is only ruined things for me. i know exactly what can help me. it is love, patience and understanding. but like i said, people around me are too ignorant or caught up with their own emotions to provide me with a bit of reassurance. i understand they have their mess to deal with. i am not asking too much. a few comforting words like i love you and i care about you. you would not find yourself alone because i wi will be there by your side helps a lot!!!!!! but i guess it is too much for them? i am tried of crying ti will my eyes are red and puffy. my teachers are also thisappointed in me. i can not do my work on ti ame because half of the ti ame my mind is busy fighting my suicidal thoughts. but they would not understand. why would they? it is not their job to. i am just so convinced to be honest that my death wouldn t mean too much to anyone. my parents wi will be hurt yes and i am agnostic so i am afraid what if there is an after life. i just do not want to suffer further wanting to end this suffering. but it is pushing me too close to really really wanting to end my life because there honestly is not anything i look up to. nothing inspires me, nothing sparks joy. i only feel two emotions, anxiety of losing everything. numb. i am sick and tired and convinced that if i am pushed more, i wi will end my life because there is not anything else that can be done. i am really afraid of what wi will happen to my parents. i really hope i find a solution.	severe
i never want to do the things that i know wi will make me feel better when i need them the most socializing a bit, meditating, listening to and playing music. it is like part of me wants to be miserable... and that part is winning.	severe
feeling lonely. hi reddit, i have not posted to this sub before, but it is been a hard day, and hard year, and i have nobody to listen. i get that complaining is not going to make anything better in the long run, but i think it might help in the moment. i got out of a relationship of just months about a year ago. it was the happiest i have ever been, and i remember thinking how perfect it was the whole ti ame. it was not, she was abusive. my therapist, family, friends, and her old friends all agree. i honestly do not miss her at all, but i miss how she made me feel like somebody else could care about me, and love me like i love me. i do not have bad self esteem, in fact, i have great self esteem, but i do worry that i am unlovable. i worry that no girl wi will ever put in the effort to get to know me because there are other dudes who she wouldn t have to try so hard to get to know. i worry my personality puts off everyone but people who re so outgoing they already have somebody. i tell my therapist all the ti ame that i do not feel good enough for what i deserve. i guess if i need to hear anything, it is that she is out there, that there are girls out there who would really genuinely love me. my therapist tells me i need to meet a girl who is very open minded, and loves to learn. it is just like i said, i hope i am not looking for more than i can ever dream of getting. i think i am worth it, and lately, it is been better. today was rough though.	severe
when would suicide be right? so i got back from the hospital a few weeks ago. before being thischarged from the hospital, i was recommended to go to a mental hospital. the doctors and staff kinda made it seem like i was in the wrong for trying. it only made me feel worse about failing than attempting really... i was told to think about my friends and family and how they would feel. but i have none of those. even in my emergency contacts they had no one to call about my incident. so i just walked back home and restarted my days as normal. i got in trouble with work for missing days, but i sti will have a job. my question is why it is so bad? i am not hurting anyone else and in my case it wouldn t effect anyone except the people who have to clean me up. if someone wants to take their life, why can not they just do it without being seen as weak or something?	severe
lowest i have ever been ever. to make a long story short, made out with a coworker while drunk a few weeks ago. talked about it the next morning and she said she wanted to stay friends and that we should chalk it up as a fun night, i am super thisappointed because i really like this girl and me confessing while drunk is what started us making out. fast forward to tonight where we and other coworkers went out again this ti ame she is totally all over another coworker. fine i think, even if they make out i am good this is just what she does. nope they do not end up making out instead, we go back to the friends house we pregamed at and instead of sleeping on the couch where i am, they start fucking in the fuse bedroom. i am listening to them right now and it is easily the most painful moment in my entire life. i feel like i have nothing going for me and she was the one bright spot i hate myself and want to die.	severe
does the toxoplasma gondii ruined my life ? first part ok this is going to be really long, so i apologize to you all first for my my poor and rusty english, i am french and, as a lot of people know, we are quite bad at foreign languages. does the toxoplasma gondii ruined my life ? that is a genuine question, a question that i ask to myself since my teenage years i am now btw , and, even if i made the most tremondous efforts to get an answer, it is sti will something that haunts my life everyday, every minutes, every seconds... if i am here today, writing on this board, it is because i totally feel powerless, abandonned and, in a way, desperate to find an answer. also, i would like to share a story, my personnal story, because i think it could be useful for some people who, maybe, got the same problems. maybe i wi will find someone who can help me? someone who has a clue about the origin of my troubles ? someone who had a successful therapy and now lives normally ? or just, maybe, someone who just understands what the fuck is happening. in this thread, i not going to lie, i not going to exaggerate, i not going to ask that we cry on my shoulder, i going to just talk about me, my experiences, my life if we can call that a life , as objectively as possible and, perhaps, this wi will makes me feel better... i was born in , in south of france. before my birth, my mom got the toxoplasmosis. the toxoplasma gondii is a parasite, a very tiny one, but also really dangerous for pregnant women and their babies. you can caught it by a cat, water, dirt, excrements etc... if a pregnant woman ingest the parasite, it can contaminate the foetus, and can lead to serious complications malformations, blindness, miscarriage, down is syndrome, behavioral thisorders ... . it is actually a quite common thing in france we are the most contaminated country in the world if i remember well . i am not going to describe all the details about this parasite, i am not an expert, and this would be so long to explain. if you are interested, here is the wikipedia page about this tiny fucker https en.wikipedia.org wiki toxoplasma gondii https en.wikipedia.org wiki toxoplasma gondii anyway, my parents are both doctors, so they were very concerned by my health when they thiscovered that my mom was infected. they knew the risk for me, and in the late is the treatments were less effective than now, there was good chances that i died at birth, or suffered from deformities. to give you an idea of the fear they had, they confessed to me a few years ago that they chose my first name only at the last minute, convinced that i might not going to survive. i never very well esti amated until this day because they always tend to mini amize their problems, but for once, i knew it was really serious. fortunately, i came out whole ! no deformities, no vision problems, no down is syndrome, a big baby in great shape. of course, i got heavely treatemt to prevent the parasite from affecting my health, particularly my eyes which could be attacked by the latter resurgences phases. they were very afraid that i would go blind. you should know that if you are born with toxoplasma gondii, it wi will infest you until the end of your life. today, there is no way to get rid of it, because it hides in your cells to protect itself from your i ammune system, and in general... it is in your brain. however, the parasite is what is called dormant , a bit like herpes, which means that most of the ti ame you do not feel its effects, at least theorically. however, my apparent good health wi will later have a direct i ampact on my parents vision for this thisease, which wi will lead, by their behavior and mine, to enormous relationship problems. indeed, as i was in great shape, and that the parasite, although present, had not affected my life, i was never considered as sick , because there was no reason to believe that i was not healed . during my childhood, they rarely spoke to me about this problem, it was a thistant memory, a great fright that had ended, for my parents, in the joy and happiness of having had a little boy. my mother was nevertheless very attentive to my health, she often took me to the ophthalmologist, to check if i had any problem the irony of the story is that i have an eagle is vision, with in each eye ! but this is not the topic lol . it is quite common for toxoplasmosis to arise during the teenage years, infecting the eyes with some kind of inflammation. if these are not treated in ti ame with many drugs, there is a good chance that the subject wi will lose one or both eyes. it was absolutely essential for her that this did not happen, of course. but besides that, and from my earliest childhood, i had many behavioral problems. the first, and not the least, is the tics. tics are behavioral troubles that result in repeated and uncontrollable gestures, such as blinking, weird breaths, erratic hand gestures, mouth sounds ... i had it all. also, as far as i can remember, i always had them. i always had a huge propensity for stress, in fact, i never stopped a single ti ame in my life from anxiety or stress. later i called it the permanent state of danger , as if my brain was blocked in danger mode and expected every minute to be attacked. from a very young age, i was terribly anxious, by everything, and anything. every change in my life, every conflict, every frustration, everything was increased tenfold. i had no resilience, i was mentally and mentally fragile, and i can not remember a single day when i did not had all these tics on my face, they have always followed me. it is exhausting, really, and absolutely depressing. i had absolutely no control over this, i was completely overwhelmed and taken aback by my emotions, i could not socialize, be close to others, feel comfortable in society. i only wanted to go home, and avoid stressful situations as much as possible. school was hell, and it never worked out. of course, from elementary school, when you do not react like the others, you are ostracized. this is obviously what happened to me, and even more so at the higher level between the first and the high school , where it was the apotheosis. anxiety slowly became my daily life. and even if i did not understand why, i was getting used to it. its consequences were numerous few friends, i started to eat a lot and put on weight, i could not concentrate in class, my academic results were poor, and i felt like i was constantly tired , without energy, without vitality. but the worst was to come... when elementary school was over, i started having eczema, and not just a little! i had it everywhere, absolutely everywhere, from the genitals to the eyes, going through the toes, it was absolutely abominable. i spent my life scratching myself, i slept very badly, and i was exhausted in the morning to go to school. with my buli amia and my complete lack of social ski wills, i had an excruciating i amage of my body, of myself, and i slowly began to fall into the hell of depression. with my entry to college the school before high school in france , i started to become aware of this situation, and i tried by many means to fight it, without never succeeding ... not only i was tired by my brain in a state of permanent anxiety, but i was also tired by my useless efforts to fight it. getting up in the morning, and that from my years, became an ordeal. what were my parents doing during this ti ame ? you would say to me, they should have realized it ! of course they knew it, and of course it affected them. but they were both ers, which means treating serious and i ammediate problems, like accidents, real , tangible things. this was not the case with their son is troubles, which were only psychosomatic . of course, they could have taken me to see a specialist, a psychologist, but my father was adamant, they are all scammers ! it never works, and his son is not crazy ironically, i rather give hi am right today, i wi will tell you about that later . and then, maybe, if i am not well, if i am so depressed, nervous, anxious, maybe it is si amply my fault ? maybe i should make an effort! doing sport, eating better, meeting people, forcing myself not to have tics or anxiety, to have other hobbies than staying on the computer or the console... after all, my father said to me, i may have been too brooded by overprotective parents, they should have prepared me for reality, i am weak, fragile, and now i do not make any effort to get out of it . i was maybe yo when he said that too me, and, obviously, that changed absolutely nothing, worse, things got ugly, it was just the beginning of a descent to hell. i first started getting beaten up. mainly by bullies, who found me every day and took advantage of my weakness and my weight to hit me. then by young people from high school that i did not know, but who seemed to have passed the word that i was a walking punching ball. of course, i replied to these attacks, of course, i tried to defend myself. but to or someti ames ? what is the point ? i losing from the start, and a punch from me was not worth half a flick from them. i spent these years in fear, covered in bruises, terrified of going back to school. the teachers, of course, did not give a damn about my condition, they carefully avoided getting involved, and never punished my bullies. none, also, gave the alert on my school results, none spoke to my parents about my depression, none supported me. i retain from this today a categorical hatred against the education of my country, and against a system which avoids as much as possible getting involved in the lives of its students. this hatred was born at that ti ame, and it touched everyone, i was starting to lose ground. but, unlike others, who take refuge in violence, i am a natural pacifist, which pushed me to rather sink into a thisabling depression, and the most total misanthropy. i started avoiding everyone, including my parents. sleep had become a comfort in which i threw myself at the slightest opportunity. my parents ended up forbidding me to spend the days in bed, so i spent them in front of the computer it was in , with the explosion of the internet and computers . i did not go out, i saw no one outside of school, i only thought of one thing to sleep, and to stop thinking. so that in the end, i started to become more and more detached from the world, by building protective barriers so thick that i could no longer touch reality. this detachment was such that i learned by myself to play the normal , to give the i amage of someone ordinary, without serious psychological thisorders even if, often, it was hard to hide . this helped me a lot during high school, where i continued to restrain my anxieties as much as possible, to bury them deeply as soon as they appeared, and above all, especially not to show them to others. i started to convince myself that no one could help me except myself, and that this mental state was my own personality, that i could never detach myself from it, that i was, of a somehow doomed. from this point in history, some people wi will certainly wonder what connection could there be with toxoplasmosis ? after all, this kind of depression is very common, it is not a parasite issue. sure, and that is exactly what i said to myself at the ti ame. for me there was absolutely no link between these problems and toxoplasmosis by the way, no scientist had made a connection either . it was much later, and completely by chance, that i started to really take an interest in the subject, and to gli ampse answers to my most inti amate questions. i think i wi will stop there for now, i wi will not make more than parts to my testi amony, i promise. the fact of writing these lines this morning has already shaken me well, i wi will take the ti ame to answer your questions if you have any in the meanti ame. thank you to everyone who has read it to the end.	severe
getting the correct diagnosis currently going through getting my third evalutation diagnosis at a psychiatrist. it is the third or fourth psychiatrist i am seeing since i was i am and hopefully i wi will get something useful out of this. for the first ti ame since starting on anti depressants at i am being taken off of them with my consent, of course and i have taken a number of tests with regards to what could potentially be wrong with me autism spectrum tests, general mood tests, personality tests regarding any personality thisorders etc. it is been a hellish past years and i have previously been diagnosed with add and several personality thisorders in the cluster c department with depressive episodes scattered throughout the years. personally, i have felt depressed since around and i have never held a job, barely finishing the mandatory education we have in denmark i was absent for most of year and of the mandatory ten years of schooling, barely passing my exams i have tried anti depressants of various kinds and brands, i have attempted cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behavioural therapy, seen various therapists and psychologists with different ski will sets and educational backgrounds, positive psychology, hypnotherapy, group therapy etc. with varying results. i have yet to try hardcore treatments like electroshock therapy or si amilarly heavy methods of treatment. i have never been sectioned, but i do live in facility with staff and other mental patients that sounds crude, but it is the best word i have i am beginning to feel like a fraud whenever i see or hear that my depressive episodes have been mild or that i might be dysthymic rather than depressed. if what i have felt suicidal over has been mild, then how bad can a depression get? if i have days were i can barely get out of my bed or eat proper food, how difficult is it to function at basic levels if you re majorly depressed? anyway i would like to know..how long did it take for you to get diagnosed correctly? and how many kinds of treatment have you tried? i really need something to reflect my own situation on good or bad..i just need something..	severe
